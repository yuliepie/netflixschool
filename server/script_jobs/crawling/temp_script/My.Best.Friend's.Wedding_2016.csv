00:01:17.578,00:01:20.789,"We're all in Milan, just waiting for you, Editor!"
00:01:20.789,00:01:22.541,"Okay, I know."
00:01:38.097,00:01:39.850,"MAN: One, two, three."
00:01:39.850,00:01:41.894,BOTH: Cheese!
00:01:41.894,00:01:43.520,Woo!

00:01:48.859,00:01:50.652,Merry Christmas!
00:01:50.652,00:01:55.490,Let's have dinner when you're free.
00:01:55.490,00:01:57.576,Who's this from?
00:01:57.576,00:01:59.995,You should ask me before you look at my phone.
00:01:59.995,00:02:02.873,WOMAN: We're best friends. There are no secrets between us.
00:02:07.377,00:02:10.171,It's been an unbelievable season.

00:02:12.758,00:02:22.101,"The veteran goalkeeper and captain, Buffon led the team to beat Barcelona for a definitive 3-1 score, making it a perfect ending to Juventus' astonishing season..."
00:02:22.101,00:02:29.108,"As a young reporter covering soccer for five years, I finally watched the Lega Serie A yesterday."
00:02:29.108,00:02:35.155,"I'd rather try my luck while I'm still young, instead of having a job with no prospects."
00:02:35.155,00:02:37.157,Maybe I will succeed.
00:02:37.157,00:02:40.077,I never thought that you would have such ambition.
00:02:40.077,00:02:42.788,Why are you so mean?
00:02:42.788,00:02:45.082,It's harmless goading.
00:02:46.125,00:02:49.210,You know I take it to heart.
00:02:49.210,00:02:57.344,"Here, I vow to God: One day, I will become a world-famous reporter!"
00:02:57.344,00:02:59.387,How do you feel right now?
00:02:59.387,00:03:02.975,What can I say?
00:03:02.975,00:03:04.643,An unbelievable night.

00:03:41.346,00:03:44.391,"WOMAN: Editor, have you arrived at the airport?"
00:03:44.391,00:03:45.851,On my way.
00:03:45.851,00:03:49.312,Still on your way?
00:03:49.312,00:03:52.273,"Ma Li, this is not my first Fashion Week."
00:03:52.273,00:03:55.069,But this is your first time there as editor-in-chief.
00:03:55.069,00:03:57.196,Do you know how busy your schedule is?
00:03:57.196,00:03:59.406,I've been prepping in Italy for so many days.
00:03:59.406,00:04:48.122,"Please don't miss-- MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING Editor, we have a fully packed schedule this week."
00:04:48.122,00:04:49.623,Time is tight.
00:04:49.623,00:04:51.959,Today you've got 13 events.
00:04:51.959,00:04:55.796,"In addition to the fashion shows, you also have other meetings."
00:04:55.796,00:04:58.132,You can do it!
00:05:01.885,00:05:03.762,Send me the schedule through WeChat.
00:05:03.762,00:05:04.846,Okay.
00:05:14.940,00:05:18.568,"Editor, what's on your mind?"
00:05:18.568,00:05:20.612,I missed a call.
00:05:20.612,00:05:21.989,Whose call?
00:05:21.989,00:05:23.615,Don't know.
00:05:23.615,00:05:25.242,"Telemarketer, maybe."
00:05:26.367,00:05:30.413,"A U.K. number, possibly Lin Ran."
00:05:30.413,00:05:32.373,Lin Ran?
00:05:32.373,00:05:34.876,"Oh, the quasi-boyfriend!"
00:05:34.876,00:05:36.878,Quasi-what?
00:05:36.878,00:05:39.464,An unexpected phone call.
00:05:39.464,00:05:42.341,Maybe it's a confession of love?
00:05:42.341,00:05:48.140,Double-check the venue details.
00:05:48.140,00:05:52.019,"Editor, what about making him your official boyfriend?"
00:05:52.019,00:05:54.021,Men and women are different.
00:05:54.021,00:05:57.649,Women have fewer options as they get older.
00:06:02.154,00:06:06.533,"Editor, you've been to Milan with Lin Ran, right?"
00:06:31.683,00:06:35.937,"Wow, we're finally here at the Lega Serie A!"
00:06:42.152,00:06:47.324,I told you we wouldn't get in without a ticket.
00:06:47.324,00:06:49.326,At least we were close to getting in.
00:06:51.203,00:06:53.288,You always say that.
00:07:14.642,00:07:16.436,Good morning!
00:07:16.436,00:07:18.563,It's a pleasure to see you again.

00:07:34.371,00:07:36.790,Hello.

00:07:43.422,00:07:45.799,"Villa Litta, again."
00:07:45.799,00:07:47.801,Okay.
00:07:47.801,00:07:50.387,Should we add some more decoration?
00:07:50.387,00:07:52.931,Maybe some flowers?
00:07:52.931,00:07:56.768,My head is killing me. I can't think about these things now.
00:07:57.769,00:08:01.231,"Hey, champagne!"
00:08:01.231,00:08:03.442,Let's have a drink.
00:08:03.442,00:08:06.027,"Editor, we don't have time."
00:08:06.027,00:08:09.489,We need to get going or we'll be late.
00:08:11.325,00:08:13.618,"Well, I should have time to get changed."
00:08:49.446,00:08:50.822,Calm down.
00:08:53.574,00:08:55.785,"Editor, a call."
00:08:57.245,00:08:59.039,Hello?
00:08:59.039,00:09:02.042,"MAN: Editor-in-Chief, is your phone working at all?"

00:09:04.503,00:09:07.381,"Wow, it's been a long time."
00:09:07.381,00:09:10.258,"Editor-in-Chief, I saw in the news you arrived in Milan."
00:09:10.258,00:09:12.802,I have something important to tell you. It's important.
00:09:12.802,00:09:19.976,Don't tell me you want to leave your job at the BBC to travel the world again.
00:09:19.976,00:09:22.396,I'm getting married!
00:09:24.689,00:09:25.899,What did you say?
00:09:25.899,00:09:27.442,I'm getting married!
00:09:27.442,00:09:29.569,"Yes, the wedding is this weekend."
00:09:29.569,00:09:32.155,"If you have time, you should come to London."
00:09:32.155,00:09:33.448,Getting married...
00:09:33.448,00:09:36.201,She's innocent and wonderful.
00:09:36.201,00:09:37.869,Her name is Meng Yixuan.
00:09:37.869,00:09:40.163,"I understand that you're busy, but we grew up together."
00:09:40.163,00:09:42.416,I'm sorry I left last time without saying goodbye.
00:09:42.416,00:09:45.793,Here's the plan: I will take care of your flight and hotel.
00:09:45.793,00:09:47.170,You have to come!
00:09:50.298,00:09:51.799,MA LI: Editor.
00:09:51.799,00:09:55.011,"Editor, your boarding pass."
00:09:56.430,00:09:59.516,"Editor, are you really leaving?"
00:09:59.516,00:10:01.476,What am I supposed to do without you?
00:10:01.476,00:10:04.979,"I can't handle it alone, Editor."

00:10:23.415,00:10:26.293,"Well, today must be my lucky day."
00:10:26.293,00:10:27.835,"Hey, I'm Nick."
00:10:56.531,00:10:58.158,So what now?
00:10:58.158,00:10:59.951,Huh?
00:10:59.951,00:11:04.205,You suddenly call and tell me that you're getting married?
00:11:04.205,00:11:07.542,So growing up together means nothing to you?
00:11:08.960,00:11:12.922,Is this how you treat your best friend?
00:11:12.922,00:11:14.466,Just notifying me like that?
00:11:14.466,00:11:16.884,Did you ever ask if I approve?
00:11:18.595,00:11:20.639,Oh. I'm sorry.
00:11:20.639,00:11:22.474,"Sir, do you need help?"
00:11:22.474,00:11:24.225,"Yeah, I probably need some napkins."
00:11:24.225,00:11:26.186,"Right away, sir."
00:11:26.186,00:11:29.856,"Um... Oh, and your drink's finished."
00:11:29.856,00:11:33.109,What is this?
00:11:33.109,00:11:35.570,"Can I get another champagne, please, as well?"
00:11:35.570,00:11:36.821,Sorry.
00:11:36.821,00:11:39.199,Oh.
00:11:39.199,00:11:41.242,"It's fine, it's fine. It's okay."
00:11:41.242,00:11:44.954,"Hey, do you want my chocolate?"
00:11:44.954,00:11:46.414,"No, thank you."

00:12:43.471,00:12:48.017,Tell me if I have done anything wrong.
00:12:48.017,00:12:51.646,Why would he marry another girl?
00:12:53.314,00:12:57.193,Try this.
00:12:57.193,00:12:58.528,Here. Try it.
00:13:19.215,00:13:21.301,That was fast!
00:13:21.301,00:13:23.678,Now can you answer my question?
00:13:23.678,00:13:27.098,People say that women with high IQs are usually left on the shelf.
00:13:28.600,00:13:30.644,How could you say that to me?
00:13:30.644,00:13:33.605,MAN: Hey!
00:13:33.605,00:13:37.942,"I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry."

00:13:40.987,00:13:44.031,I just can't control my emotions.
00:13:44.031,00:13:45.492,Breathe. Breathe.
00:13:50.747,00:13:53.291,Breathe.

00:14:39.462,00:14:41.339,It's been forever.
00:14:41.339,00:14:42.841,Miss me?
00:14:42.841,00:14:44.133,Awesome.
00:14:50.014,00:14:52.767,Whoa. Let me introduce you. Come on.
00:14:54.602,00:14:58.898,"Here. This is my fiancée, Xuan Xuan."
00:14:58.898,00:15:01.234,"This is my best friend, Gu Tu Tu."
00:15:01.234,00:15:02.777,Stop calling me that.
00:15:02.777,00:15:06.740,I know I should call you Ms. Gu.
00:15:06.740,00:15:08.408,You can just call me Gu Jia.
00:15:08.408,00:15:09.701,"Okay, totally."
00:15:09.701,00:15:11.578,Gu Jia.
00:15:11.578,00:15:14.288,"Hey, where is your luggage?"
00:15:14.288,00:15:16.457,"I came in such a hurry, I forgot to bring it."
00:15:16.457,00:15:19.502,You are such a good friend.
00:15:19.502,00:15:22.296,Don't worry. You can try on some of my outfits tomorrow.
00:15:22.296,00:15:25.550,As long as you don't mind looking kind of girly.
00:15:25.550,00:15:28.928,She's an editor-in-chief in the fashion industry.
00:15:28.928,00:15:31.264,She won't have a problem getting pretty dresses.
00:15:31.264,00:15:33.974,Right. I can get any outfit with just a phone call.
00:15:35.059,00:15:39.564,"How about we go to my house first, then drive you to the hotel tonight?"
00:15:39.564,00:15:40.815,Shall we?
00:15:40.815,00:15:42.734,Can I say no?
00:15:42.734,00:15:43.943,Of course...
00:15:43.943,00:15:45.278,not.
00:15:46.529,00:15:48.281,Let's go.
00:15:50.617,00:15:53.077,What do you think of my fiancée?
00:15:53.077,00:15:57.707,"She's, like, totally young, totally pretty and, like, totally cute."
00:15:57.707,00:16:01.127,That's how all Post-'90s talk.
00:16:01.127,00:16:02.462,Why are you talking like that?
00:16:02.462,00:16:04.631,Who says it's only for the Post-'90s?
00:16:04.631,00:16:05.882,"Oh, okay. I'm sorry."
00:16:05.882,00:16:07.341,I am totally pretty.
00:16:07.341,00:16:10.261,XUAN: What's wrong?
00:16:10.261,00:16:13.431,RAN: Let's open the convertible roof for Gu Jia.
00:16:13.431,00:16:15.141,"XUAN: Yeah, sure."
00:16:15.141,00:16:16.726,RAN: We'll go to the car first.
00:16:18.812,00:16:21.773,Look at you.
00:16:23.608,00:16:24.901,Sit tight.
00:16:24.901,00:16:26.319,Is this car yours?
00:16:27.946,00:16:29.906,Of course!
00:16:29.906,00:16:32.575,A fancy car for an editor-in-chief.
00:16:50.969,00:16:53.554,"Gu Jia, how do you like the car?"
00:16:53.554,00:16:57.350,Lin Ran bought it after he got promoted at the BBC.
00:16:57.350,00:16:58.768,Awesome.
00:17:00.269,00:17:02.355,Isn't my friend pretty?
00:17:02.355,00:17:04.482,Of course.
00:17:05.733,00:17:07.234,Thanks.
00:17:07.234,00:17:09.737,You think just because you look so fancy now...
00:17:09.737,00:17:13.032,I've forgotten how cheap you were back then.
00:17:13.032,00:17:15.368,"I might have been poor, but I was never cheap."
00:17:15.368,00:17:18.579,Did I ever blink an eye when I bought you three hamburgers?
00:17:18.579,00:17:22.542,"Yeah, but on our trip, who made us share a hotel room to save money?"
00:17:22.542,00:17:23.960,"Oh, count your blessings."
00:17:23.960,00:17:27.046,"You slept in the bed, and I slept on the floor."
00:17:27.046,00:17:30.299,"Had our trip lasted longer, I would've had to pawn all my belongings."
00:17:30.299,00:17:32.468,You know...
00:17:32.468,00:17:35.889,Gu Jia believes that I should always be the one who takes care of the bills.
00:17:35.889,00:17:37.849,That's not true.
00:17:37.849,00:17:42.102,"XUAN: You know, the BBC is promoting him to be a producer in America."
00:17:42.102,00:17:45.272,Lin Ran is really outstanding.
00:17:45.272,00:17:48.067,That's enough.
00:17:48.067,00:17:50.653,"Stop bragging, or I will have no room to improve."
00:17:50.653,00:17:58.202,But you are great Enough.
00:17:59.286,00:18:01.121,I'll get even better in the future.
00:18:02.206,00:18:03.583,Great.
00:18:03.583,00:18:06.293,RAN: Do you believe me?
00:18:27.147,00:18:30.234,JIA: Your house?
00:18:30.234,00:18:31.986,Finally.
00:18:31.986,00:18:33.988,Help me out of the car.
00:18:33.988,00:18:36.198,You are always in a hurry.
00:18:36.198,00:18:38.785,I want to see your new house!
00:18:40.119,00:18:42.872,JIA: Small door for such a big house.
00:18:46.793,00:18:48.962,So classy.
00:18:48.962,00:18:52.298,I thought your home would be splendid and magnificent.
00:18:52.298,00:18:57.136,"Turns out, it is quite elegant."
00:18:57.136,00:19:00.807,"Gu Jia, come with me."
00:19:04.602,00:19:06.228,"Hey, hold on."
00:19:06.228,00:19:09.649,This is the ladies' fitting room. Get out of here.
00:19:09.649,00:19:11.191,Xuan Xuan.
00:19:14.320,00:19:16.322,Gu Jia...
00:19:16.322,00:19:21.119,you look even prettier in person than in the photos he showed me.
00:19:21.119,00:19:22.954,You are so young and talented.
00:19:22.954,00:19:27.207,I would have fallen in love with you if I were him.
00:19:27.207,00:19:29.460,I think so too.
00:19:29.460,00:19:32.672,But he is right.
00:19:32.672,00:19:33.965,Did he say that?
00:19:35.591,00:19:37.510,Look.
00:19:37.510,00:19:40.054,What do you think of this?
00:19:40.054,00:19:42.974,It's nice.
00:19:42.974,00:19:45.601,"No, it's for the best man."
00:19:45.601,00:19:47.645,It's made for you.
00:19:47.645,00:19:50.523,Me? Best man?
00:19:50.523,00:19:54.652,You'd better get a guy to be the best man. Why me?
00:19:54.652,00:19:57.864,Gu Jia.
00:19:57.864,00:20:07.790,"Lin Ran always said that you were like his sibling, his only family after his parents were gone."
00:20:07.790,00:20:10.877,I want to surprise him.
00:20:10.877,00:20:13.295,Can you please be his best man?
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.006,No way.
00:20:15.006,00:20:17.967,I know you'll change your mind.
00:20:17.967,00:20:22.138,"Please. I'm begging you, Gu Jia."
00:20:22.138,00:20:24.557,I'm begging you.
00:20:24.557,00:20:25.808,I'll be back.
00:20:25.808,00:20:28.602,Try it on. Try it on!
00:20:31.022,00:20:32.815,Best man?
00:20:32.815,00:20:35.275,I came here to be the bride!
00:20:38.237,00:20:40.656,This should be my dress.
00:20:59.800,00:21:01.969,"Yes, I do."
00:21:17.443,00:21:21.155,XUAN: Are you ready?
00:21:26.535,00:21:28.246,Why are you wearing the veil?
00:21:28.246,00:21:31.249,Oh. Oh. Uh...
00:21:31.249,00:21:33.751,"Thanks, Gu Jia, for trying on the veil."
00:21:35.544,00:21:37.421,It's very nice and beautiful.
00:21:37.421,00:21:39.215,Is there something wrong with the veil?
00:21:39.215,00:21:42.135,"No, I just wanted to see how I should put it on."
00:21:43.803,00:21:45.221,That's right.
00:21:45.221,00:21:48.182,"Hello, I'm Gu Jia."
00:21:48.182,00:21:50.517,Welcome!
00:21:50.517,00:21:52.061,Let me show you around.
00:21:52.061,00:21:53.520,Please make yourself at home.
00:21:56.315,00:21:59.443,XUAN: So Lin Ran invited his very best friend.
00:21:59.443,00:22:02.780,MR. MENG: Who knew that Lin Ran's friend was so pretty.
00:22:02.780,00:22:04.615,"Xuan Xuan, you'd better be careful."
00:22:04.615,00:22:08.494,"Dad, Gu Jia is pretty, but what about me?"
00:22:08.494,00:22:10.454,You are my daughter.
00:22:10.454,00:22:12.372,Did you give birth to her?
00:22:12.372,00:22:18.671,You would've never had such a beautiful daughter if it weren't for me. Can you give birth to a baby? Then show us.
00:22:20.464,00:22:22.133,Daddy. James.
00:22:22.133,00:22:23.968,Congratulations to you both.
00:22:23.968,00:22:25.303,Hi. Thank you.
00:22:25.303,00:22:27.221,JAMES: Lovely to see you.
00:22:36.814,00:22:40.109,"Hey, beautiful."
00:22:43.112,00:22:45.363,These are all your friends?
00:22:45.363,00:22:47.533,My only friend is on my left.
00:22:50.661,00:22:53.039,They're all her dad's friends.
00:22:53.039,00:22:54.456,I'll introduce them.
00:22:54.456,00:22:57.459,He's one of the top students at Cambridge.
00:22:57.459,00:23:00.338,Has three Ph.D.s and two Masters.
00:23:00.338,00:23:02.548,No wonder he's so sophisticated.
00:23:02.548,00:23:05.176,Don't be so mean.
00:23:06.719,00:23:11.224,"That one, not good-looking, but he's rich."
00:23:11.224,00:23:14.352,He's got an annual salary of£3 million! Impressive.
00:23:16.687,00:23:20.316,It's not possible for everyone to be as handsome as I am.
00:23:20.316,00:23:22.360,He's a psychiatrist.
00:23:22.360,00:23:25.363,Enough!
00:23:30.826,00:23:33.829,Are you seeing someone?
00:23:37.457,00:23:38.709,Okay.
00:23:38.709,00:23:40.418,Impossible.
00:23:40.418,00:23:43.881,"For a strong woman like you, finding a partner is difficult."
00:23:43.881,00:23:47.301,You should hurry up while you are still young.
00:23:47.301,00:23:50.012,Find someone reliable.
00:23:53.599,00:23:56.227,I'm sincerely thankful for your concern.
00:24:05.569,00:24:08.114,Getting old?
00:24:08.114,00:24:10.283,I think I'm still in good shape.
00:24:31.429,00:24:39.061,"We've been so busy preparing for the wedding, arguing over who to invite, that we almost called it off."
00:24:41.272,00:24:42.606,Tu Tu...
00:24:44.108,00:24:45.609,...thank you for being here.
00:24:47.194,00:24:50.197,We're good friends.
00:24:50.197,00:24:52.283,Let me know if you need anything in London.
00:24:52.283,00:24:54.576,Okay.
00:24:55.786,00:24:57.121,"Hey, Lin Ran."
00:24:59.832,00:25:03.419,Let's go for a drink.
00:25:03.419,00:25:06.964,Another day.
00:25:06.964,00:25:08.506,You know how busy we are.
00:25:08.506,00:25:10.550,See you at the cake shop tomorrow.
00:25:48.047,00:25:50.216,JIA: Congratulations!
00:25:50.216,00:25:51.591,RAN: Cheers!
00:26:00.100,00:26:06.315,I thought that you would quit school and start working .after your parents passed away.
00:26:07.274,00:26:12.321,"But you stayed, and now you're graduating."
00:26:12.321,00:26:15.949,I have finally fulfilled my parents' last wish.
00:26:15.949,00:26:22.789,"When I get a real job and save some money, I will go travel the world."
00:26:22.789,00:26:24.124,Okay.
00:26:25.042,00:26:26.793,"You go, I go."
00:26:26.793,00:26:28.921,Really?
00:26:28.921,00:26:30.506,To our friendship!
00:26:52.194,00:26:53.611,JIA: Beautiful.
00:26:57.450,00:26:59.368,It's so beautiful here.
00:27:11.422,00:27:13.090,RAN: Stop! Stop!
00:27:23.683,00:27:26.061,"Hey, we're almost 30 years old."
00:27:26.061,00:27:30.357,There is an old saying: Start your family before your career.
00:27:30.357,00:27:32.568,What do you think?
00:27:32.568,00:27:34.278,Sounds good.
00:27:40.951,00:27:42.744,Are you seeing someone?
00:28:11.231,00:28:15.402,We are best friends.
00:28:15.402,00:28:18.155,It would be downright incestuous.
00:29:02.449,00:29:04.618,Maybe six is better.
00:29:04.618,00:29:09.373,But I want more candy inside.
00:29:21.427,00:29:22.969,Hey! Lin Ran.
00:29:22.969,00:29:26.098,"Gu Jia, my head is going to explode."
00:29:26.098,00:29:27.974,Do you have a minute?
00:29:27.974,00:29:29.685,"Here, come help me."
00:29:29.685,00:29:32.104,"Hi, Bill. Do we have peanuts in this cake?"
00:29:32.104,00:29:34.814,"BILL: Yes, for some guests."
00:29:34.814,00:29:37.943,"Try this. Give me one minute, and I'll give you the world."
00:29:37.943,00:29:39.903,Go away.
00:29:39.903,00:29:43.741,"Hey, Bill. Remember my fiancée cannot have peanuts."
00:29:43.741,00:29:45.951,"You are here, Ms. Gu."
00:29:45.951,00:29:48.120,Drop the Ms.
00:29:48.120,00:29:49.747,Gu Jia.
00:29:52.374,00:29:55.711,Look at the way he eats.
00:29:56.836,00:29:58.171,Dorky and adorable.
00:30:00.758,00:30:03.176,Lin Ran always says what he likes most is my silliness.
00:30:03.176,00:30:06.388,XUAN: He loves me so much and always takes care of me.
00:30:06.388,00:30:08.056,I can't live without him.
00:30:08.056,00:30:11.310,"RAN: Remember, my fiancée cannot have peanuts."
00:30:11.310,00:30:14.938,JIA: This cupcake isn't bad.
00:30:14.938,00:30:17.274,RAN: My fiancée cannot have peanuts.
00:30:17.274,00:30:19.151,Mm!
00:30:19.151,00:30:21.570,Xuan Xuan.
00:30:23.614,00:30:24.698,What's wrong?
00:30:25.783,00:30:26.825,Xuan Xuan.
00:30:28.368,00:30:29.578,Stop.
00:30:29.578,00:30:31.580,Too much information.
00:30:31.580,00:30:34.458,I'm going to the restroom.
00:30:52.685,00:30:54.060,Forget it.
00:31:00.984,00:31:05.113,Xuan Xuan's choosing the wine.
00:31:06.281,00:31:09.075,She can take care of it.
00:31:12.287,00:31:13.497,Hm?
00:31:16.375,00:31:22.381,"So, Associate Producer at the BBC, your dream finally came true."
00:31:22.381,00:31:23.965,Yes.
00:31:23.965,00:31:26.134,So you're going to live in London?
00:31:26.134,00:31:27.845,Sure.
00:31:29.054,00:31:31.807,No wonder you look so hot right now.
00:31:32.808,00:31:34.142,Really?
00:31:34.142,00:31:36.729,You never approve of my choices.
00:31:36.729,00:31:37.855,Handsome!
00:31:41.149,00:31:43.902,Extremely handsome?
00:31:43.902,00:31:45.404,Don't be ridiculous.
00:31:47.155,00:31:49.449,I'm just worried.
00:31:49.449,00:31:52.202,You changed yourself for someone else.
00:31:54.413,00:32:00.043,"When you are really in love, nothing else really matters."
00:32:05.173,00:32:08.552,I've been adrift for so long.
00:32:08.552,00:32:11.513,Now I finally have somewhere to settle down.
00:32:11.513,00:32:14.182,Aren't you happy for me?
00:32:20.898,00:32:22.190,I'm happy for you.
00:32:22.190,00:32:23.483,Good girl.
00:32:23.483,00:32:24.610,Thanks.
00:32:25.861,00:32:28.697,Have you ever been on a double-decker bus?
00:32:28.697,00:32:30.490,Do you want to have a try?
00:32:30.490,00:32:33.493,I haven't been on one for years.
00:32:33.493,00:32:35.662,I'm wearing high heels!
00:32:44.087,00:32:46.506,"Hey, look!"
00:32:46.506,00:32:47.591,Vespa.
00:32:48.801,00:32:50.051,Yes.
00:32:50.051,00:32:52.763,Do you remember that summer in Milan?
00:32:52.763,00:32:55.515,You said we would travel all around Italy on a Vespa.
00:32:56.767,00:32:58.560,Circling the Milan Cathedral.
00:32:58.560,00:33:01.647,It's so easy to make you happy.
00:33:04.817,00:33:08.862,It's been so long since we've spent time together.
00:33:08.862,00:33:11.615,I've been in London for days.
00:33:11.615,00:33:13.909,Is this how you take care of your guests?
00:33:13.909,00:33:15.410,My apologies.
00:33:17.871,00:33:19.748,"Today, I'm all yours."
00:33:19.748,00:33:22.793,I'll take you wherever you want.
00:33:22.793,00:33:23.877,Okay?
00:33:26.212,00:33:28.590,Let's go.
00:33:34.847,00:33:36.515,Wait for me.
00:33:38.391,00:33:40.686,"Come on, lady."
00:33:40.686,00:33:41.937,Let's go.
00:33:41.937,00:33:45.315,Good weather today.
00:33:45.315,00:33:54.950,XUAN XUAN Isn't that enough?
00:33:54.950,00:33:56.034,Nice.
00:33:59.245,00:34:33.864,LIN RAN XUAN XUAN Hello.
00:34:33.864,00:34:36.992,"MA LI: Editor, we need you back now!"
00:34:36.992,00:34:40.412,Lots of things are pending your confirmation.
00:34:40.412,00:34:44.332,I'm still working on something more important than Fashion Week.
00:34:44.332,00:34:48.127,Send me my luggage as soon as possible.
00:34:48.127,00:34:49.922,What about here in Milan?
00:34:49.922,00:34:51.423,"Oh, right."
00:34:49.922,00:34:53.132,I forgot to tell you: You are now promoted to editor-in-chief.
00:34:53.132,00:34:55.260,"Wait, what did you say?"
00:34:55.260,00:34:56.636,Bye-bye.
00:34:55.260,00:35:02.141,I can't do it-- Oh...
00:35:32.756,00:35:34.674,Whoo...
00:35:56.237,00:35:57.697,I'm the editor-in-chief.
00:36:07.373,00:36:09.542,Let me search on Vipshop.
00:36:12.420,00:36:15.173,It's almost 10:00 in Beijing.
00:36:15.173,00:36:17.467,Let me see what's new.
00:36:26.852,00:36:29.604,"So, what did you ask me out for?"
00:36:31.397,00:36:34.818,I asked you out to go shopping with me.
00:36:34.818,00:36:38.363,Come on.
00:36:41.491,00:36:49.207,"Yesterday, my mom asked if I was sure I wanted to marry Lin Ran."
00:36:49.207,00:36:58.299,"Then my dad said if I do marry him, maybe he should resign from the BBC and take over my father's company."
00:36:58.299,00:36:59.676,Resign?
00:37:01.302,00:37:02.512,Wow.
00:37:03.388,00:37:04.514,I didn't say anything.
00:37:04.514,00:37:07.475,"But when I turned around, Lin Ran was standing right behind me."
00:37:07.475,00:37:09.186,Then he stormed out in a rage.
00:37:09.186,00:37:11.604,I didn't even have a chance to explain.
00:37:11.604,00:37:13.148,So?
00:37:15.358,00:37:20.530,"Gu Jia, what should I do so he will forgive me?"
00:37:22.532,00:37:25.493,You didn't do anything wrong.
00:37:25.493,00:37:32.959,"I have never seen him so angry before, like he would leave me at any moment."
00:37:36.588,00:37:40.425,"Honestly, I think you are still quite young."
00:37:40.425,00:37:43.511,Are you sure you want to get married this early?
00:37:44.554,00:37:45.680,Of course!
00:37:45.680,00:37:47.557,I love him.
00:37:47.557,00:37:50.810,"I will, and I must!"
00:37:50.810,00:37:56.775,"Gu Jia, he's been mad for two days over what my parents said."
00:37:56.775,00:38:02.155,"What's worse, my ex-boyfriend texted me and he saw it."
00:38:02.155,00:38:04.616,What if he refuses to marry me?
00:38:04.616,00:38:06.534,Let me think about it.
00:38:10.413,00:38:17.670,"You should just tell him: If you're gonna get mad when others try to be nice to you, why should we stay together?"
00:38:22.259,00:38:26.304,Wouldn't he get even angrier if I say that?
00:38:28.306,00:38:29.557,Don't worry.
00:38:29.557,00:38:33.103,Just listen to me and tell him what I said.
00:38:35.814,00:38:37.107,Mm.
00:38:38.150,00:38:40.652,"I'll listen to you, Gu Jia."
00:38:40.652,00:38:41.987,Oh!
00:38:41.987,00:38:44.447,Those shoes look amazing on you.
00:38:44.447,00:38:46.199,Let me buy them for you.
00:38:46.199,00:38:48.952,No need.
00:38:48.952,00:38:50.787,It is my pleasure to make you a present.
00:38:50.787,00:38:52.998,"Christian, how are you?"
00:38:52.998,00:38:54.207,How are you?
00:38:54.207,00:38:56.835,"Oh, my God!"
00:38:56.835,00:38:58.670,She is a big fan.
00:38:58.670,00:39:00.713,This is Christian Louboutin.
00:39:00.713,00:39:02.465,I know who you are!
00:39:03.842,00:39:05.093,Excuse me.
00:39:06.178,00:39:08.972,I love your shoes.
00:39:08.972,00:39:10.890,Thank you.
00:39:10.890,00:39:14.477,MA LI: I've heard that Karl's cats make several million euros.
00:39:14.477,00:39:17.230,Shut up. Listen to me.
00:39:17.230,00:39:20.608,Huh? What?
00:39:20.608,00:39:22.360,Angelica Cheung?
00:39:22.360,00:39:23.653,She's good friends with the big boss.
00:39:23.653,00:39:25.322,I know!
00:39:25.322,00:39:28.908,"If she sees you, then everyone will know you aren't in Milan."
00:39:32.578,00:39:35.290,Send me my luggage right away.
00:39:35.290,00:39:36.791,Thank you.
00:39:36.791,00:39:38.584,"Hi, Christian, good to see you."
00:39:38.584,00:39:40.461,CHRISTIAN: How are you?
00:39:41.213,00:39:42.630,Come.
00:39:42.630,00:39:44.382,Come out.
00:40:09.574,00:40:11.409,Gu Jia!
00:40:11.409,00:40:14.913,What's wrong?
00:40:14.913,00:40:16.873,I did what you said.
00:40:21.711,00:40:24.756,My parents just want what's best for us.
00:40:24.756,00:40:26.632,What do you mean?
00:40:27.967,00:40:34.766,"You know, if you're going to get mad when others try to be nice to you, why should we stay together?"
00:40:39.687,00:40:42.481,Then let's cancel the wedding.
00:40:42.481,00:40:44.734,But Lin Ran just got even angrier.
00:40:44.734,00:40:46.986,Now he wants to cancel the wedding!
00:40:46.986,00:40:49.488,Cancel the wedding!
00:40:49.488,00:40:54.077,What should I do?
00:40:54.077,00:40:56.121,Calm down. Calm down.
00:40:59.165,00:41:02.001,Let me talk to him.
00:41:11.844,00:41:14.180,I've been looking for you.
00:41:18.393,00:41:19.477,Why?
00:41:21.646,00:41:23.689,You know why.
00:41:23.689,00:41:25.608,You were right.
00:41:25.608,00:41:28.027,The rich think about nothing but money.
00:41:28.027,00:41:29.946,But that's not their fault.
00:41:29.946,00:41:32.282,You are from different backgrounds.
00:41:32.282,00:41:34.951,It's natural that you have different values.
00:41:41.416,00:41:42.875,Is that what she said to you?
00:41:46.379,00:41:47.797,Yep.
00:41:51.509,00:41:57.140,Do me a favor and tell her she needs to understand: I am who I am.
00:41:57.140,00:42:00.268,"I am marrying her, not her family."
00:42:20.705,00:42:22.123,Really?
00:42:24.000,00:42:25.877,"So, what should I do now?"
00:42:28.296,00:42:29.547,What to do...
00:42:31.174,00:42:33.885,You should know by now how he handles things.
00:42:33.885,00:42:36.429,Maybe just leave him alone for a while.
00:42:36.429,00:42:38.223,Leave him alone?
00:42:39.516,00:42:44.521,Can you ask him to not be left alone too long?
00:42:47.106,00:42:49.401,"Okay, I will talk to him again."
00:42:49.401,00:42:52.404,That's great!
00:42:58.117,00:43:00.245,What is it?
00:43:00.245,00:43:04.999,"She said: The ceremony is soon, friends and family are all coming."
00:43:04.999,00:43:10.880,Don't make your own life difficult-- Cancel the wedding!
00:43:14.426,00:43:16.511,Cancel the wedding?
00:43:21.015,00:43:22.100,Hey.
00:43:24.561,00:43:25.603,Lin Ran!
00:43:28.731,00:43:30.525,Lin Ran.
00:43:32.735,00:43:33.945,Calm down.
00:43:35.196,00:43:37.782,Stop being so mad.
00:43:37.782,00:43:40.034,"Hey, I'm in heels!"
00:43:40.034,00:43:42.661,Are you my best friend?
00:43:42.661,00:43:44.205,So you understand me best?
00:43:44.205,00:43:46.082,Of course.
00:43:49.544,00:43:54.799,"Actually, the first time I saw you two, I felt like you were from different worlds."
00:43:54.799,00:43:59.720,She lives in a luxurious house and grew up like a princess.
00:44:01.598,00:44:03.015,Don't be silly.
00:44:03.015,00:44:09.021,You don't think that becoming an Associate Producer at the BBC and driving a convertible can give her security?
00:44:09.021,00:44:11.857,Do you know what she wants?
00:44:11.857,00:44:14.611,An heir to the family.
00:44:14.611,00:44:16.737,"Wait, what did you just say?"
00:44:17.947,00:44:19.198,An heir.
00:44:19.198,00:44:20.699,Not that.
00:44:22.118,00:44:24.245,Don't be silly.
00:44:27.039,00:44:28.541,Security!
00:44:32.920,00:44:34.506,I'm such a jerk.
00:44:37.383,00:44:38.635,Lin Ran!
00:44:52.023,00:44:53.274,Gu Jia.
00:44:55.860,00:44:57.111,Gu Jia.
00:44:58.488,00:45:01.533,Now I can't help loving you more than ever.
00:45:05.453,00:45:08.914,Lin Ran is very lucky to have such a great friend.
00:45:08.914,00:45:10.041,That's good.
00:45:12.335,00:45:16.130,"You know, we've already talked it over."
00:45:16.130,00:45:18.799,We will speak to my parents together.
00:45:18.799,00:45:22.136,He is not good at doing business.
00:45:22.136,00:45:24.847,I won't force him to do anything.
00:45:24.847,00:45:27.975,"As long as he is by my side, I have security."
00:45:27.975,00:45:30.186,That's all I need.
00:45:32.146,00:45:33.523,Security...
00:45:35.316,00:45:36.942,It's good you made up.
00:45:36.942,00:45:39.028,It's good that you figured it out.
00:45:39.028,00:45:43.866,"Otherwise, he might have started traveling again and left you alone."
00:45:43.866,00:45:45.410,Wouldn't that suck?
00:45:50.873,00:45:52.375,Excuse me.
00:45:56.254,00:45:58.797,Xuan Xuan.
00:46:08.391,00:46:12.687,"Gu Jia, I can't help loving you more than ever."
00:46:12.687,00:46:13.812,Mwah!
00:46:14.606,00:46:16.148,Ugh!
00:46:28.494,00:46:30.413,There you go.
00:46:30.413,00:46:35.876,"I like standup comedy as much as the next man, but that guy was no good."
00:46:33.124,00:46:37.336,"I mean, he opened with a-- Hello."
00:46:37.336,00:46:39.088,"Hi, there."
00:46:39.088,00:46:41.466,"Ah, whiskey."
00:46:41.466,00:46:42.425,Whiskey shot.
00:46:42.425,00:46:44.469,Shot? Okay.
00:46:46.011,00:46:47.096,Pleasure.
00:46:48.598,00:46:50.807,That's the girl from the plane.
00:46:51.808,00:46:53.519,Don't let her see me here.
00:46:53.519,00:46:55.438,Never seen a beautiful girl?
00:46:56.355,00:46:58.357,There you go. Enjoy.
00:46:58.357,00:46:59.609,Thank you.
00:47:06.407,00:47:08.242,Do you want another one?
00:47:08.242,00:47:10.536,"Yes, please."
00:47:18.835,00:47:21.088,Thank you.
00:47:21.088,00:47:23.174,Cheers.
00:47:25.593,00:47:26.678,One more.
00:47:26.678,00:47:29.305,"Whoa, okay."
00:47:47.281,00:47:49.158,What's happening?
00:47:49.158,00:47:50.951,She's not answering her phone.
00:47:53.663,00:47:57.625,Don't worry.
00:47:57.625,00:47:59.669,I shouldn't worry just because she's an adult?
00:47:59.669,00:48:02.588,She is new in town.
00:48:04.256,00:48:08.219,You haven't heard from the hotel? Where would she go?
00:48:08.219,00:48:10.388,What worries me is that she took my car.
00:48:10.388,00:48:13.890,She can barely drive.
00:48:13.890,00:48:15.892,She doesn't even know which side to drive on.
00:48:15.892,00:48:19.063,What if she's in an accident and someone gets hurt?
00:48:19.063,00:48:20.857,WOMAN 1: I can't believe it...
00:48:20.857,00:48:23.442,"WOMAN 2: Yes, darling. Yes, darling."
00:48:23.442,00:48:25.570,WOMAN 1: After all the years we spent together.
00:48:25.570,00:48:27.613,"I've been there for you, I've supported you."
00:48:27.613,00:48:30.783,How could you do this to me?
00:48:30.783,00:48:33.452,I thought we were going to spend the rest of our lives together.
00:48:33.452,00:48:37.164,"No. I'm sorry, he belongs to me now."
00:48:37.164,00:48:40.209,No! No!
00:48:40.209,00:48:41.711,No!
00:48:43.629,00:48:47.216,You don't know how much I love you.
00:48:47.216,00:48:50.845,"If you want, I can change."
00:48:50.845,00:48:54.849,"I can change, and be a sweet girl, a cute girl."
00:48:55.974,00:48:58.227,And I will support you.
00:48:58.227,00:49:00.979,"If I do that, would you please-- Sorry, guys. I'm so sorry."
00:49:00.979,00:49:02.939,So sorry.
00:49:02.939,00:49:04.859,Who is she?
00:49:04.859,00:49:07.986,Who is she!
00:49:14.660,00:49:16.078,NICK: Hello?
00:49:16.078,00:49:18.205,Hello?
00:49:18.205,00:49:19.624,Who is this?
00:49:19.624,00:49:21.333,Why do you have Gu Jia's phone?
00:49:21.333,00:49:24.503,"Don't worry, Gu Jia's fine."
00:49:24.503,00:49:26.631,Where is Gu Jia?
00:49:26.631,00:49:29.966,I'll tell her to call you back when she wakes up. Bye.
00:49:29.966,00:49:31.469,Hey. Hey!
00:49:38.016,00:49:40.185,RAN: Tu Tu!
00:49:41.103,00:49:42.521,Tu Tu!
00:49:47.067,00:49:48.778,RAN: Tu Tu.
00:49:50.195,00:49:51.864,Lin Ran...
00:49:51.864,00:49:53.990,What's wrong with you?
00:49:53.990,00:49:55.785,He doesn't want me.
00:49:55.785,00:49:58.704,It's his loss.
00:49:58.704,00:50:01.457,I'm not a bad-looking girl.
00:50:01.457,00:50:02.999,"Okay, get up."
00:50:02.999,00:50:07.003,Why doesn't he want me?
00:50:08.506,00:50:11.258,Lin Ran.
00:50:11.258,00:50:15.011,No one loves me.
00:50:22.770,00:50:24.020,Why are you here?
00:50:29.902,00:50:33.698,Your Lin Ran just called.
00:50:33.698,00:50:35.115,Lin Ran?
00:50:38.369,00:50:40.454,How do you know him?
00:50:41.914,00:50:45.041,I know everything about you guys since you were 3.
00:50:52.216,00:50:53.759,You know...
00:50:54.969,00:50:57.388,when he was on the phone just now...
00:50:58.389,00:51:00.224,he sounded...
00:51:02.309,00:51:04.979,What?
00:51:08.399,00:51:09.692,Anxious.
00:51:09.692,00:51:11.485,Really?
00:51:15.614,00:51:17.157,Oh...
00:51:17.157,00:51:19.911,Let me reintroduce myself.
00:51:19.911,00:51:21.286,Gu Jia.
00:51:23.247,00:51:24.957,I'm Nick.
00:51:25.833,00:51:27.292,Nice to meet you.
00:51:43.642,00:51:45.061,I'm sorry.
00:51:49.023,00:51:51.191,What happened?
00:51:51.191,00:51:53.360,I was looking for you all night!
00:51:53.360,00:51:54.987,You were worried?
00:51:54.987,00:51:57.448,"If something happened to you, how could I get married?"
00:51:57.448,00:52:00.451,"I'm just a bridesmaid, not the bride! Why are you so mad?"
00:52:01.660,00:52:03.412,Nick.
00:52:03.412,00:52:04.789,Hi.
00:52:04.789,00:52:06.040,"Yes, they're mine."
00:52:06.040,00:52:07.625,"Congratulations, man."
00:52:09.167,00:52:11.253,Gu Jia!
00:52:11.253,00:52:13.297,You're finally here!
00:52:13.297,00:52:15.257,You don't know how worried he was last night.
00:52:15.257,00:52:16.592,He almost called the police.
00:52:16.592,00:52:17.843,Really?
00:52:17.843,00:52:19.428,She was at my place.
00:52:19.428,00:52:20.888,It was you?
00:52:20.888,00:52:22.180,"Nick, my boyfriend."
00:52:22.180,00:52:23.682,Hi.
00:52:23.682,00:52:25.893,Congratulations to you.
00:52:25.893,00:52:27.478,She is my fiancée.
00:52:27.478,00:52:28.729,Congrats to you two.
00:52:28.729,00:52:30.689,Thanks.
00:52:30.689,00:52:32.942,"Okay, why don't we go inside."
00:52:32.942,00:52:34.068,Let's go.
00:52:34.068,00:52:35.778,NICK: It's rather windy.
00:52:41.993,00:52:43.786,Where'd this boyfriend come from?
00:52:43.786,00:52:45.412,Are you really dating?
00:52:45.412,00:52:47.665,You didn't tell me you were getting married either.
00:52:47.665,00:52:48.874,This is so sudden.
00:52:48.874,00:52:51.127,Why can't I have a boyfriend?
00:52:51.127,00:52:53.129,You got drunk and didn't come back last night.
00:52:53.129,00:52:54.797,What's wrong with you?
00:52:54.797,00:52:57.299,Your first time in London.
00:52:57.299,00:52:59.010,Now all of a sudden you have a boyfriend?
00:52:59.010,00:53:01.137,"Hey, that's not a big deal nowadays, right?"
00:53:01.137,00:53:02.262,Right?
00:53:02.262,00:53:04.348,What's the matter?
00:53:05.265,00:53:06.600,These are my parents.
00:53:06.600,00:53:08.435,"How are you, auntie?"
00:53:08.435,00:53:09.895,He speaks Chinese.
00:53:09.895,00:53:11.689,Congratulations.
00:53:11.689,00:53:13.816,Her boyfriend.
00:53:13.816,00:53:15.734,Thank you.
00:53:15.734,00:53:19.030,"Hey, Lin Ran is going to go play soccer with the guys."
00:53:19.030,00:53:21.615,You should invite Nick to join them.
00:53:21.615,00:53:22.783,Can you play?
00:53:25.369,00:53:27.245,"Lin Ran, come on!"
00:53:29.999,00:53:31.583,MR. MENG: Come on!
00:53:59.737,00:54:01.572,Sorry.
00:54:07.661,00:54:08.913,"Lin Ran, come on!"
00:54:22.093,00:54:23.886,Come on!
00:54:35.731,00:54:37.273,You're a good player.
00:54:37.273,00:54:39.151,So are you.
00:54:42.113,00:54:44.573,When did you meet Gu Jia?
00:54:46.242,00:54:51.163,We met a few days ago on the flight to London.
00:54:51.163,00:54:53.457,What? A few days ago?
00:54:53.457,00:54:56.127,She caught my eye immediately.
00:54:56.127,00:54:59.004,Love at first sight probably.
00:54:59.004,00:55:00.256,Ridiculous!
00:55:36.708,00:55:40.754,I think our game is working.
00:55:40.754,00:55:42.840,You see the way he's looking at you?
00:55:46.885,00:55:48.637,Hold me tighter.
00:55:51.890,00:55:54.935,Do you want to take it to another level?
00:55:54.935,00:55:57.896,Sure. How?
00:55:57.896,00:55:59.564,Take a seat.
00:56:07.614,00:56:10.951,"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, sorry to interrupt."
00:56:10.951,00:56:17.082,The love between Lin Ran and Xuan Xuan has touched me deeply.
00:56:17.082,00:56:23.839,So please allow me to make a toast and dedicate a song to the goddess of my heart: Gu Jia.
00:57:18.643,00:57:20.020,Thank you.
00:57:22.940,00:58:07.025,"CHOIR: Gu Jia, I've always dreamed of having my wedding in a cathedral."
00:58:07.025,00:58:09.987,Just like a prince and princess.
00:58:09.987,00:58:15.742,"Baby, no matter where the wedding is, you are always my princess."
00:58:15.742,00:58:18.536,You're my prince too.
00:58:19.746,00:58:21.123,"XUAN: Wow, it's so cold."
00:58:22.333,00:58:27.796,"By the way, Gu Jia, I can book this place for your and Nick's wedding, too."
00:58:27.796,00:58:31.258,"Baby, I don't think they're getting married anytime soon."
00:58:31.258,00:58:33.969,That's not necessarily true.
00:58:33.969,00:58:36.472,We both like to keep things simple.
00:58:36.472,00:58:40.392,"But for the wedding, it has to be a romantic location."
00:58:40.392,00:58:42.769,What about Santorini?
00:58:42.769,00:58:45.105,That sounds amazing.
00:58:45.105,00:58:46.523,"Gu Jia, we need to talk."
00:58:47.483,00:58:49.026,"Baby, I'll be right back."
00:58:49.026,00:58:50.610,"Baby, I'll be right back."
00:58:54.948,00:58:56.574,Now what?
00:58:59.577,00:59:02.998,You're already talking marriage after knowing him a few days?
00:59:02.998,00:59:05.501,You've never been like this.
00:59:05.501,00:59:07.544,Aren't you getting a little carried away?
00:59:07.544,00:59:09.213,Not really.
00:59:09.213,00:59:10.881,He's handsome.
00:59:10.881,00:59:12.508,Can handsome pay the bills?
00:59:14.759,00:59:17.804,And you want to marry him?
00:59:22.434,00:59:24.019,Are you jealous?
00:59:28.773,00:59:30.234,Jealous?
00:59:30.234,00:59:32.069,I'm just worried about you!
00:59:34.363,00:59:36.907,I'm getting married soon.
00:59:36.907,00:59:40.285,I won't be around to comfort you if he breaks your heart.
00:59:40.285,00:59:42.538,So don't get married.
00:59:43.621,00:59:45.040,Is everything okay?
00:59:46.208,00:59:48.168,We're just talking.
00:59:48.168,00:59:50.754,Why don't you just take her away from me.
00:59:52.130,00:59:54.466,What do you mean?
00:59:55.426,00:59:56.968,She's my girlfriend now.
00:59:56.968,00:59:58.303,Stop it.
00:59:58.303,01:00:00.305,You've known each other for a few days.
01:00:00.305,01:00:02.182,Do you know how long I've known her?
01:00:02.182,01:00:03.267,Do you?
01:00:06.603,01:00:07.854,What?
01:00:07.854,01:00:09.356,"Wait, wait. Stop, stop!"
01:00:14.194,01:00:17.989,Let's stop making fun of him.
01:00:17.989,01:00:19.575,"Actually, she's not my cup of tea."
01:00:19.575,01:00:21.410,You are.
01:00:22.619,01:00:24.913,"Oh, my God!"
01:00:24.913,01:00:26.540,What's going on here?
01:00:28.292,01:00:32.087,Gu Jia told me how you worry that she doesn't have a boyfriend.
01:00:32.087,01:00:34.756,Right!
01:00:37.134,01:00:39.970,So he is...?
01:00:42.222,01:00:43.765,Oh!
01:00:43.765,01:00:46.393,You two have gone too far.
01:00:46.393,01:00:49.229,Pretending to be together.
01:00:49.229,01:00:52.023,"I'm just afraid that-- What's up, man?"
01:00:52.023,01:00:55.026,What? So you don't like people like me?
01:00:59.490,01:01:02.493,"No, I'm very open."
01:01:02.493,01:01:04.869,"Yes, come on."
01:01:06.121,01:01:08.499,My son.
01:01:08.499,01:01:10.334,May I have a word with you?
01:01:10.334,01:01:11.668,"Yes, Father."
01:01:15.839,01:01:17.424,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
01:01:17.424,01:01:19.259,I know.
01:01:21.261,01:01:23.888,I hope it wasn't too much.
01:01:23.888,01:01:27.725,Game over.
01:01:27.725,01:01:29.769,Let's go.
01:01:29.769,01:01:32.397,You're wasting too much time on this.
01:01:32.397,01:01:34.525,It's fun.
01:01:34.525,01:01:37.569,I told you he still loves you.
01:01:37.569,01:01:43.033,What you need to do is find an opportunity to tell him that you love him.
01:01:43.033,01:01:44.784,What?
01:01:44.784,01:01:47.704,You know what I'm saying.
01:01:47.704,01:01:51.458,No way!
01:01:51.458,01:01:54.044,I'd be crazy to tell him that I love him now!
01:01:54.044,01:01:57.214,What do I do if he says no?
01:01:57.214,01:01:59.591,How do you know if you don't try?
01:02:02.802,01:02:05.222,I'm going.
01:02:05.222,01:02:06.515,Taxi.
01:02:09.518,01:02:10.977,You can do it.
01:02:29.580,01:02:32.708,"JIA: Lin Ran, time flies."
01:02:32.708,01:02:35.001,I wish we could go back to the old days.
01:02:35.001,01:02:40.340,RAN: Do you remember I told you that I wanted to travel around the world?
01:02:40.340,01:02:42.092,Of course.
01:02:42.092,01:02:45.303,And you wanted me to go with you.
01:02:45.303,01:02:47.222,You're lucky that you didn't follow me.
01:02:47.222,01:02:49.224,I lost interest in everything by the end.
01:02:49.224,01:02:51.643,I even thought about jumping in the river.
01:02:51.643,01:02:53.604,The way you talk is still so dramatic.
01:02:53.604,01:02:58.108,I think of myself as a firefly.
01:02:58.108,01:03:00.694,At least I still have that little light on my butt.
01:03:00.694,01:03:03.655,You wanted to light up the whole world.
01:03:07.784,01:03:11.204,But I lost that last bit of light later on.
01:03:11.204,01:03:15.250,And I became no better than a fly.
01:03:16.585,01:03:18.920,That's not true.
01:03:18.920,01:03:23.634,I'm not like you. You work like you have a motor inside you.
01:03:23.634,01:03:26.970,Of course. I try my best and I go for it!
01:03:28.096,01:03:30.682,I've found my motor now.
01:03:30.682,01:03:32.559,It's Xuan Xuan.
01:03:37.773,01:03:41.234,She's different from other girls.
01:03:41.234,01:03:44.488,"She supports me, no matter what I do."
01:03:44.488,01:03:47.949,I want to be a better man and protect her.
01:03:50.868,01:03:52.412,I need to be protected too.
01:03:52.412,01:03:54.748,Hmm?
01:03:54.748,01:03:57.083,I should have given you more support.
01:04:00.920,01:04:04.633,"Ever since my parents passed away, you've always been by my side."
01:04:04.633,01:04:06.301,All the time.
01:04:10.347,01:04:15.560,This may be the last time we get to spend time alone.
01:04:18.730,01:04:20.982,Not even for a cup of coffee?
01:04:24.319,01:04:27.614,Marriage is wonderful.
01:04:27.614,01:04:29.741,It's like a contract.
01:04:29.741,01:04:34.078,"Once you sign, responsibilities follow."
01:04:35.205,01:04:37.999,Everything changes.
01:04:41.127,01:04:43.547,You can choose not to sign.
01:04:43.547,01:04:44.881,Why wouldn't I?
01:04:44.881,01:04:46.174,I love Xuan Xuan.
01:04:46.174,01:04:47.509,I love her and only her.
01:04:47.509,01:04:59.396,"She always says, if you love someone, you need to shout it out loud, or-- You might lose your chance."
01:05:18.956,01:05:21.167,You lost your chance again.
01:05:21.167,01:05:23.920,You still haven't spoken your heart?
01:05:25.171,01:05:27.090,Speak my heart?
01:05:30.761,01:05:32.387,Tell him I love him?
01:05:35.515,01:05:37.392,It's too late.
01:05:40.812,01:05:43.648,Just find a way to postpone the wedding.
01:05:51.322,01:05:53.074,How's that possible?
01:06:01.416,01:06:04.461,It's now or never.
01:06:25.064,01:06:27.609,I must get the special discount.
01:06:33.657,01:06:35.867,"Hi, Gu Jia speaking."
01:06:35.867,01:06:39.120,Is this Ma Li?
01:06:39.120,01:06:40.413,Editor?
01:06:43.124,01:06:45.961,Can you help me postpone...
01:06:48.004,01:06:50.423,Lin Ran's wedding at the cathedral tomorrow?
01:06:50.423,01:06:53.343,Postpone it?
01:06:53.343,01:06:56.888,"Editor, are you finally pursuing your own happiness?"
01:06:56.888,01:06:58.765,"Editor, we don't need to confirm the event."
01:06:58.765,01:07:01.184,It's canceled.
01:07:01.184,01:07:02.644,Huh?
01:07:02.644,01:07:04.771,"Uh...okay, I'll do it now."
01:07:08.191,01:07:09.609,Thank you.
01:07:12.612,01:07:13.905,I'm so bad.
01:07:25.458,01:07:28.879,No matter what happens...
01:07:30.672,01:07:33.008,I'm here.
01:07:33.008,01:07:34.634,Where can I find Gu Jia?
01:07:34.634,01:07:36.135,"Sir, you cannot enter."
01:07:36.135,01:07:37.762,Tu Tu!
01:07:37.762,01:07:39.723,Tu Tu!
01:07:39.723,01:07:41.057,Sir.
01:07:41.057,01:07:42.350,What's going on?
01:07:44.644,01:07:46.646,The cathedral canceled the wedding!
01:07:48.023,01:07:50.692,Canceled?
01:07:50.692,01:07:52.235,Wasn't it postponed?
01:07:52.235,01:07:54.612,Postponed?
01:07:55.572,01:07:57.490,I mean...
01:07:57.490,01:07:58.867,Can they postpone it?
01:08:12.047,01:08:15.884,"Hey, can you stop pacing back and forth like that?"
01:08:18.344,01:08:19.846,What can I do?
01:08:22.724,01:08:25.852,Let nature take its course.
01:08:30.147,01:08:31.733,"Tu Tu, answer me."
01:08:31.733,01:08:36.153,"Every girl has a dream wedding in mind, right?"
01:08:36.153,01:08:37.488,Yes.
01:08:39.908,01:08:45.121,I must give her the best.
01:08:45.121,01:08:48.374,My girl has to be the happiest in the world.
01:08:52.003,01:08:53.170,Hey...
01:08:53.170,01:08:55.840,Stay away from the platform edge.
01:08:55.840,01:08:58.676,I must think of a solution.
01:08:58.676,01:09:00.845,She's always dreamt of a wedding in a cathedral.
01:09:00.845,01:09:03.347,I can't even make that happen.
01:09:03.347,01:09:05.266,You always give her whatever she wants!
01:09:05.266,01:09:08.812,"If she truly wants to marry you, does the location really matter?"
01:09:12.649,01:09:14.442,Come closer.
01:09:14.442,01:09:16.527,It's dangerous.
01:09:49.769,01:09:53.272,Aren't you coming in with me?
01:09:53.272,01:09:56.901,I'll be there in a minute.
01:09:56.901,01:09:58.235,Okay.
01:10:21.801,01:10:25.722,"Ma Li, I told you to postpone the wedding."
01:10:25.722,01:10:27.223,Why did you cancel it?
01:10:27.223,01:10:30.560,MA LI: What? What was canceled?
01:10:30.560,01:10:32.395,The wedding!
01:10:32.395,01:10:36.357,"Editor, I forgot to tell you that I couldn't reach them."
01:10:36.357,01:10:37.984,Couldn't reach them?
01:10:37.984,01:10:40.778,Yeah. It was canceled?
01:10:40.778,01:10:43.990,"Editor, it's probably meant to be."
01:10:43.990,01:10:45.408,Really?
01:10:45.408,01:10:49.079,"Editor, you must take this chance."
01:10:50.621,01:10:52.957,"Yeah, we're looking for another wedding venue."
01:10:55.793,01:10:58.088,"As long as you are happy, I can do anything."
01:10:58.088,01:10:59.797,Do you like this place?
01:11:00.715,01:11:02.383,Great!
01:11:03.634,01:11:07.555,I will listen to you regarding all family matters.
01:11:07.555,01:11:09.015,"Okay, baby?"
01:11:09.015,01:11:11.017,Okay.
01:11:11.935,01:11:14.812,"Tu Tu, come here."
01:11:18.524,01:11:20.151,You were right.
01:11:20.151,01:11:23.863,I told Xuan Xuan about the cancellation.
01:11:23.863,01:11:25.907,I guess I got worried over nothing.
01:11:25.907,01:11:29.368,She said that the location isn't important.
01:11:29.368,01:11:33.123,What's important is that we're together.
01:11:41.047,01:11:42.632,Take the call.
01:11:42.632,01:11:43.967,Baby!
01:11:46.803,01:11:48.054,Are you choosing the bouquet?
01:11:48.054,01:11:50.140,"XUAN: Yeah, look at this."
01:11:50.140,01:11:51.641,RAN: This one is good.
01:11:51.641,01:11:53.684,XUAN: This one is pretty.
01:11:55.394,01:11:57.438,RAN: It's so easy to make you happy.
01:11:57.438,01:11:59.816,JIA: I came here to be the bride!
01:12:09.450,01:12:12.328,How do you know if you don't try?
01:12:12.328,01:12:15.706,There should be more roses at the wedding venue.
01:12:22.255,01:12:24.215,So beautiful.
01:12:24.215,01:12:25.716,What is this place?
01:12:25.716,01:12:26.926,"Right, baby?"
01:12:26.926,01:12:28.261,"Hey, Lin Ran."
01:12:31.555,01:12:33.724,I think I found a place for the wedding.
01:12:34.892,01:12:36.144,Really?
01:12:38.229,01:12:40.023,Awesome!
01:13:40.833,01:13:43.086,What?
01:13:43.086,01:13:44.754,Are you sure?
01:13:46.130,01:13:47.924,Thank you.
01:13:55.056,01:13:57.225,Wow.
01:13:57.225,01:13:59.936,You look great.
01:13:59.936,01:14:01.562,Why aren't you ready yet?
01:14:03.064,01:14:07.402,I've just finished an event.
01:14:08.945,01:14:10.571,How's Xuan Xuan?
01:14:10.571,01:14:13.116,"Relax, I got her the best hairdresser and makeup artist."
01:14:13.116,01:14:14.242,She's in good hands.
01:14:15.785,01:14:19.872,"By the way, you aren't allowed to see the bride before the ceremony."
01:14:21.791,01:14:23.626,Thank you.
01:14:26.170,01:14:31.801,"If you really want to thank me, take a walk with me."
01:14:31.801,01:14:34.178,Huh?
01:14:58.953,01:15:00.496,Do you remember this place?
01:15:04.583,01:15:06.043,Stop! Stop!
01:15:18.889,01:15:22.685,"Lin Ran, I need to tell you-- Tu Tu."
01:15:22.685,01:15:25.729,"Before you say anything, I'd like to ask you something."
01:15:29.566,01:15:31.319,Okay.
01:15:31.319,01:15:35.072,Did you ask Nick to cancel the wedding at the cathedral?
01:15:42.663,01:15:44.832,I've been investigating.
01:15:46.834,01:15:49.670,I heard back from the cathedral.
01:15:50.838,01:15:54.384,They said someone named Nick canceled it.
01:15:54.384,01:15:57.261,I didn't ask him to do anything!
01:15:57.261,01:15:59.722,Why did he do that?
01:16:01.807,01:16:03.684,Tu Tu...
01:16:03.684,01:16:05.019,why?
01:16:06.562,01:16:08.814,Why did you ask him to cancel my wedding?
01:16:10.816,01:16:14.945,"You're my best friend, the most important person in the world to me."
01:16:14.945,01:16:18.908,"I invited you to my wedding, hoping to share my happiness."
01:16:18.908,01:16:28.334,I remember it was exactly here where you asked me if I could give you a chance and be with you.
01:16:31.337,01:16:34.549,I want to say yes now.
01:16:36.675,01:16:43.474,"If the wedding must go on, I wish I could be the bride."
01:16:46.561,01:16:49.439,If you also want to be with me...
01:16:51.774,01:16:55.861,I can be the bad guy and explain everything to the guests.
01:16:58.697,01:17:00.575,Lin Ran...
01:17:00.575,01:17:03.327,choose me.
01:17:03.327,01:17:06.414,I will bring you happiness.
01:17:27.810,01:17:29.437,Tu Tu...
01:17:30.854,01:17:32.482,...stop it.
01:17:32.482,01:17:34.108,It's in the past.
01:17:35.443,01:17:38.946,I need to protect someone else now.
01:17:41.073,01:17:42.741,Don't be like that.
01:17:46.537,01:17:48.331,I understand.
01:18:12.522,01:18:14.064,Xuan Xuan!

01:18:56.773,01:18:59.485,Xuan Xuan!

01:19:03.864,01:19:05.115,"Ah, so great."
01:19:08.952,01:19:10.287,Stop chasing me!
01:19:10.287,01:19:11.622,Stop!
01:19:27.722,01:19:29.848,Stop.
01:19:29.848,01:19:31.058,RAN: Xuan Xuan!

01:20:10.723,01:20:12.141,Xuan Xuan!
01:20:17.229,01:20:21.858,"Don't come any closer, or I'll throw myself against the wall!"
01:20:21.858,01:20:24.194,Go ahead.
01:20:24.194,01:20:26.905,I can be the bride if you're dead.
01:20:26.905,01:20:29.825,I knew I was right.
01:20:29.825,01:20:31.994,You are in love with Lin Ran!
01:20:31.994,01:20:33.203,Right.
01:20:33.203,01:20:36.749,"The whole world knows, except you."
01:20:43.255,01:20:44.923,You finally admit it.
01:20:47.092,01:20:50.095,You tricked us into coming here to try to win him back.
01:20:50.095,01:20:53.265,I'm telling you that is not gonna happen!
01:20:57.520,01:20:59.021,Yes.
01:20:59.021,01:21:06.696,I have been trying to get him back Because I never thought he would leave me one day.
01:21:13.994,01:21:18.833,"You know, I really disliked you the first day we met."
01:21:20.835,01:21:24.129,You were so cute and innocent.
01:21:25.214,01:21:27.090,It made me sick.
01:21:30.636,01:21:35.015,"But in Lin Ran's eyes, you are precious."
01:21:35.015,01:21:37.476,He would do anything to protect you.
01:21:43.482,01:21:44.859,And me?
01:21:44.859,01:21:48.445,"To him, I will always be his best friend."
01:21:50.656,01:21:54.326,"You will regret it, as I do, if you don't go back now."
01:21:55.870,01:21:57.454,RAN: Xuan Xuan!
