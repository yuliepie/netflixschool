00:06:45.363,00:06:49.242,"You'd run the company, but after-hours, you work for us."

00:07:19.230,00:07:23.067,"uh, family, friends, even Lucy. It's Lucy, right?"
00:07:25.486,00:07:27.071,"Yeah, that's right."
00:07:28.322,00:07:30.116,That'd be a problem.
00:07:34.495,00:07:35.329,What?
00:07:36.080,00:07:37.415,All this is legal?
00:07:38.541,00:07:41.377,"If you're doing it for the good guys, yeah."
00:07:44.881,00:07:46.424,You wanna take her for a spin?
00:07:49.260,00:07:51.804,I want you to take her for a spin.

00:08:40.019,00:08:42.271,"This is gonna be good for us, all right?"
00:08:42.355,00:08:44.023,What about benefits?
00:08:44.106,00:08:45.399,Our healthcare?
00:08:45.942,00:08:47.443,We have great healthcare with TWA.
00:08:49.195,00:08:51.280,"You know, I'm sure that's not gonna be a problem."
00:08:51.364,00:08:53.658,"And what the hell does IAC mean, anyway?"
00:08:56.702,00:08:58.996,Independent Aviation Consultants.
00:09:00.581,00:09:02.917,"Well, that sounds fuckin' made up, Barry."

00:09:54.010,00:09:56.596,Where are you... Where are you going?
00:09:58.681,00:10:02.059,"Barry! Barry, where are you going?"
00:10:06.814,00:10:09.066,That was bold.
00:10:09.817,00:10:11.485,That was bold.
00:10:12.361,00:10:14.697,I do tend to leap before I look.
00:10:20.453,00:10:23.539,Maybe I should have asked a few more questions.
00:10:24.665,00:10:27.251,"Anyway, it was back in '78 and, uh..."
00:10:28.461,00:10:31.631,It was September? October.
00:10:31.797,00:10:33.424,"Anyway, it, uh..."
00:10:36.260,00:10:39.388,That was the day I joined the CIA.
00:10:48.522,00:10:51.942,"Now, in those days, the Cold War was in full swing."
00:10:53.402,00:10:57.698,The Soviets were backing communist insurgents all over Central America.
00:11:03.329,00:11:04.872,And the CIA wanted snaps of them insurgents.
00:11:33.943,00:11:34.944,Who's responsible?
00:11:35.986,00:11:37.488,They're mine.

00:12:27.288,00:12:28.122,Fuck!
00:12:29.415,00:12:30.416,Whoo!
00:12:48.142,00:12:51.437,"And he goes, God damn it, Schafer, I didn't ask for mug shots."
00:12:54.231,00:12:57.651,"I mean, they say they're the best reconnaissance photos they have ever seen."
00:12:58.986,00:13:00.821,Does this mean I get a raise?
00:13:01.113,00:13:02.323,You're doing great.
00:13:03.699,00:13:05.201,"Hey, you got a family, Schafer?"
00:13:10.498,00:13:12.500,Wife? Kids?
00:13:15.252,00:13:16.253,"See, I, uh..."
00:13:17.254,00:13:20.341,I didn't tell Lucy I ain't working for TWA no more.
00:13:22.760,00:13:24.595,You're serving your country.
00:13:27.723,00:13:30.726,I am gonna need some more money at some point.
00:13:31.894,00:13:33.145,You'll figure it out.
00:13:36.857,00:13:37.858,"We, uh..."
00:13:38.442,00:13:39.902,We're sending you to Panama tomorrow.
00:13:43.989,00:13:45.533,they gave me another job.
00:13:46.242,00:13:47.493,Bagman.
00:13:48.327,00:13:52.998,"See, there was this colonel down in Panama named Noriega."
00:13:55.209,00:13:58.546,And he was selling the agency's intel on all the commies down there.
00:13:58.629,00:13:59.672,For your friends.
00:14:07.638,00:14:08.722,Just drop off...

00:15:43.567,00:15:44.902,Welcome.
00:15:47.196,00:15:48.822,Come on up.
00:15:58.999,00:16:00.459,Thank you for coming to see me.
00:16:01.085,00:16:04.672,"Sir, I... I think there's been some sort of mistake here, because I..."
00:16:04.755,00:16:10.970,"These fellas just picked me up at the airport, and-- No, no. No mistake. Just, please, have a seat."
00:16:11.136,00:16:13.013,"Coffee, Mr. Seal?"
00:16:15.516,00:16:17.184,You know my name?
00:16:18.102,00:16:20.354,You're the gringo who flies to Central America every week...
00:16:21.105,00:16:23.148,taking pictures very low with your fancy plane.
00:16:27.236,00:16:33.492,"Those photos... See, I have a, uh, aviation company here in South America that I-- Yes. Yes, the AIC."
00:16:33.575,00:16:35.619,"IAC. Yes, sir."
00:16:36.286,00:16:38.163,Or is it CIA?
00:16:40.833,00:16:41.667,No...
00:16:41.750,00:16:44.378,"No, no, no. I'm just a businessman here."
00:16:44.545,00:16:45.796,I'm a businessman.
00:16:45.879,00:16:49.049,"Imports, exports, cattle, horses."
00:16:51.135,00:16:52.636,But now...
00:16:55.264,00:16:59.560,"Now, God above has blessed this great country with new riches, Mr. Seal."
00:17:01.979,00:17:03.814,And you could help us.
00:17:06.650,00:17:07.484,How's that?
00:17:08.819,00:17:13.699,"You know the routes, you can get in and out of Estados Unidos with your fancy plane."
00:17:18.537,00:17:21.832,What... What kind of riches are we talking about here?
00:17:43.729,00:17:47.691,"We had a few difficulties getting our exports to your country, Mr. Seal."
00:17:52.154,00:17:53.197,"Ma'am, what's in the bag?"
00:17:58.368,00:18:00.370,We decided to try new ideas.
00:18:01.205,00:18:05.459,"We want you to take off from here, fly directly to Miami."
00:18:06.210,00:18:09.004,"We'll pay you $2,000 per kilo."
00:18:15.594,00:18:17.012,How much is a kilo?
00:18:18.013,00:18:20.599,"2.2 pounds, Mr. Seal."
00:18:32.653,00:18:34.863,every 2.2 pounds.
00:18:39.243,00:18:41.829,"I... I'm sorry, fellas."
00:18:42.329,00:18:44.331,I didn't catch y'all's names.
00:18:45.124,00:18:46.041,Jorge Ochoa.
00:18:46.625,00:18:47.793,Carlos Lehder.
00:18:48.293,00:18:50.045,Pablo Escobar.
00:18:50.170,00:18:53.632,"A couple of billion dollars from now, they'd be known as the Medellín Cartel."
00:18:54.383,00:18:59.847,"Back then, they were just three businessmen trying to figure out how to get their merchandise to the United States."
00:19:01.473,00:19:03.267,There was just one small problem.
00:19:03.433,00:19:07.813,"See, pilots, they were killing themselves trying to get off that runway."
00:19:07.896,00:19:10.399,I see you had a few other boys try to make it outta here.
00:19:11.984,00:19:13.402,Terrible pilots.
00:19:16.238,00:19:17.573,"Yeah, well..."
00:19:18.740,00:19:24.037,"I'm sure they were heavy, you know, carrying a lot of fuel to make it to the States, and merchandise, and..."
00:19:29.001,00:19:33.630,"Yeah, you know, this airport, I mean, it's high altitude and a short runway."
00:19:33.714,00:19:37.509,"And, I mean, shit, you got trees and mountains on both sides."
00:19:43.307,00:19:44.433,"Is there, uh..."
00:19:44.850,00:19:46.685,Is there somewhere else I could take off from?
00:19:51.523,00:19:52.566,"Well, uh..."
00:19:54.234,00:19:55.485,Can you make the runway longer?
00:20:10.709,00:20:11.877,That you can't do it.
00:20:25.307,00:20:29.519,You're gonna land at the Okeechobee airport between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.
00:20:32.481,00:20:40.405,"There's been a change of plans, 'cause I ain't landing in Miami in-- See, I ain't landing anywhere with this stuff."
00:20:40.489,00:20:41.949,That's... That's how y'all got in trouble.
00:20:42.032,00:20:43.909,"Now, look, just... Just hear me out."
00:20:44.243,00:20:46.620,"I know Louisiana. Now, here's a map."
00:20:47.621,00:20:51.625,"Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff right where X marks the spot."
00:20:55.128,00:20:56.880,"What do you mean, you're not gonna land, huevón?"
00:20:59.758,00:21:01.760,"Hey. Come here, look..."
00:21:03.262,00:21:04.304,Look... Just look at this.
00:21:06.974,00:21:08.141,Look.
00:21:09.559,00:21:10.936,See right here?
00:21:11.436,00:21:12.521,See that there?
00:21:12.688,00:21:13.689,Hmm.
00:21:14.606,00:21:17.192,Right there is your million-dollar door.
00:21:30.580,00:21:34.001,All right. You just go around. Each side.
00:21:34.626,00:21:35.919,But tight.
00:21:42.551,00:21:44.428,"No, no, no. No more."
00:21:45.637,00:21:47.014,I said no more.
00:21:50.225,00:21:51.977,"But there's plenty of room, gringo."
00:21:54.563,00:21:58.066,"Guys, guys, it ain't about room, all right?"
00:21:58.150,00:21:59.067,It's about weight.
00:21:59.484,00:22:02.863,"Now, we agreed on 200, I even put on 300."
00:22:08.452,00:22:11.330,Keep pushing. Come on. Need all the runway I can get.
00:22:11.705,00:22:13.623,Keep going. Keep going.
00:22:20.839,00:22:21.840,Bien. Bien.
00:22:22.799,00:22:24.009,"Gracias, gracias."
00:22:30.932,00:22:32.934,"Where the hell do you think you're going, big fella?"
00:22:33.018,00:22:34.686,Come on. Out.
00:22:35.353,00:22:37.147,He's gonna guard our product.
00:22:40.817,00:22:42.444,This guy's fatter than fuck.
00:22:42.611,00:22:45.030,"I'm already 1,500 pounds overweight."
00:22:47.032,00:22:51.495,Either I fly the big fella or I fly your product.
00:23:04.174,00:23:06.051,"Good luck, hermano."
00:23:06.134,00:23:07.677,Christ will keep you safe.
00:23:09.679,00:23:12.599,He ain't gonna make this runway any longer.
00:23:15.060,00:23:17.395,"Hey, Jorge. Come here, give me that."
00:23:53.932,00:23:54.975,Come on.
00:24:09.114,00:24:10.448,"Come on, come on, come on."
00:24:11.074,00:24:12.075,Come on!
00:24:26.882,00:24:28.466,"Oh, Jesus!"
00:25:38.703,00:25:42.249,I've got a possible target headed due north 25 miles offshore.
00:25:42.332,00:25:43.166,Yeah.
00:26:00.267,00:26:03.186,That's platform 14. One of Shell's helicopters.
00:26:03.270,00:26:05.272,You can disregard.
00:27:33.735,00:27:35.111,Cheers! Cheers!
00:27:43.078,00:27:44.204,For you.
00:27:53.380,00:27:56.049,You want me to go... He wants me to go again on Wednesday?
00:27:56.132,00:27:57.801,Yes. Next Wednesday.
00:28:03.515,00:28:05.141,Pablo! Jorge!
00:28:11.940,00:28:13.274,Oh... Whoa!
00:28:24.494,00:28:25.578,What...
00:28:27.414,00:28:30.041,What is that? You want me to wait here?
00:28:31.084,00:28:31.918,Pablo?
00:28:59.195,00:29:00.155,"No, no, no."
00:29:25.930,00:29:27.223,Barry Seal.
00:29:27.766,00:29:29.058,Schafer?
00:29:29.517,00:29:31.102,-Barry Seal? -Schafer?
00:29:31.519,00:29:33.646,"Yeah. No, no, no. Oh, my God!"
00:29:33.730,00:29:35.148,You look terrible.
00:29:35.648,00:29:37.317,It is so good to see you.
00:29:37.400,00:29:39.194,-You missing a tooth? -Yeah.
00:29:39.277,00:29:40.236,-Listen-- -What the fuck?
00:29:40.320,00:29:42.697,-See these fellas right here? -Yeah.
00:29:42.781,00:29:44.866,I think they know that I am CIA.
00:29:46.868,00:29:48.203,You're not CIA.
00:29:49.078,00:29:51.206,"You're a drug smuggler, Barry."
00:29:52.040,00:29:55.376,"Listen, Louisiana PD was notified of your arrest here."
00:29:56.336,00:29:58.046,They're gonna raid your house at 6:00 a.m.
00:29:58.463,00:30:00.840,"They're gonna pick up Lucy, bring her in for questioning."
00:30:01.216,00:30:02.842,Maybe even keep her overnight.
00:30:04.010,00:30:05.386,"Oh, my God."
00:30:06.554,00:30:09.182,"Oh, my God. You gotta get me out of here."
00:30:10.600,00:30:12.101,"Well, maybe..."
00:30:13.311,00:30:15.355,Maybe we could figure something out.
00:30:20.527,00:30:24.906,"'Cause, believe me, shit gets crazy from here."
00:30:25.323,00:30:28.493,Do you remember them fellas that I told you I was taking snaps of?
00:30:28.618,00:30:30.078,Turns out they was a bunch of commies.
00:30:30.203,00:30:32.288,Called themselves Sandinistas.
00:30:32.372,00:30:38.336,These fellas managed to get their shit together and take control right here in this little country called Nicaragua.
00:30:38.586,00:30:40.463,"Oh, no, that's El Salvador."
00:30:40.547,00:30:42.173,Here you go. Nicaragua.
00:30:45.051,00:30:46.469,in Central America.
00:30:49.097,00:30:50.265,but not for me.
00:30:50.390,00:30:52.267,"See, there was a new sheriff in town."
00:30:52.433,00:30:57.230,"My fellow Americans, I must speak to you tonight about a mounting danger in Central America."
00:30:59.399,00:31:00.859,I still love Ronnie Reagan.
00:31:00.984,00:31:04.612,"I mean, any man that can make it from that monkey movie all the way to the White House..."
00:31:07.490,00:31:11.870,And what he wanted was to kick them commie Sandinistas out of Nicaragua.
00:31:11.953,00:31:16.291,"And he wanted the Nicaraguan freedom fighters, called Contras, to do it."
00:31:16.374,00:31:20.795,They need to know that the U.S. supports them with more than just pretty words and good wishes.
00:31:22.630,00:31:28.052,"the makings of another Vietnam, and they outright refused to let Ronnie have his war."
00:31:28.511,00:31:31.472,But do you think them politicians could tell the Gipper what to do?
00:31:32.765,00:31:38.479,"Hell no. He turned to the CIA, and the CIA turned to me."
00:31:38.646,00:31:43.318,"Schafer? So, Schafer, that morning raid on my family, that's off now, right?"
00:31:43.484,00:31:46.362,"No, no. That's, uh... That's still happening."
00:31:46.446,00:31:48.156,-What? -6:00 a.m.
00:31:48.239,00:31:49.574,This fucking country!
00:31:49.657,00:31:51.159,"-Well, hold on, now. -Stop!"
00:31:51.659,00:31:52.869,"Now, we have a deal!"
00:31:52.952,00:31:54.245,"I'm not a cop, Barry."
00:31:54.329,00:31:56.748,"I can't make a search warrant go away, you know?"
00:31:56.998,00:31:58.166,Things are in motion here.
00:31:58.249,00:32:00.418,"Come on, man. What the hell am I gonna do?"
00:32:00.668,00:32:02.837,I suggest you get your family outta Louisiana.
00:32:02.921,00:32:04.589,"Well, where am I supposed to take them?"
00:32:04.672,00:32:06.549,We got a place for ya.
00:32:07.258,00:32:08.092,Mena.
00:32:08.718,00:32:09.594,Arkansas.
00:32:12.096,00:32:13.514,Arkansas?
00:32:18.186,00:32:20.480,"-Mmm. -Hey, Luce."
00:32:21.272,00:32:22.815,"Mmm. Hey, baby."
00:32:22.899,00:32:23.942,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:32:26.945,00:32:29.155,"My God, baby, what happened to you?"
00:32:29.238,00:32:30.323,I'm okay.
00:32:30.657,00:32:32.867,"Barry, you're missing a tooth."
00:32:36.037,00:32:36.871,We're moving.
00:32:38.206,00:32:40.208,We gotta pack everything up.
00:32:40.541,00:32:43.795,We gotta be outta here before the sun comes up.
00:32:43.962,00:32:44.963,"We, uh..."
00:32:45.964,00:32:47.924,"So, we'll get these dresses and..."
00:32:48.383,00:32:49.634,"Do you, uh..."
00:32:49.968,00:32:51.260,You need all them shoes?
00:32:53.513,00:32:54.847,"Well, hey there, sunshine."
00:32:55.098,00:32:56.557,How you doing?
00:32:56.641,00:32:58.768,"Now, look. I'm gonna give you a plastic bag."
00:32:59.185,00:33:04.023,"What I want you to do is you go upstairs and you put your favorite toys-- Go on back to bed, honey. Daddy done lost his mind."
00:33:04.107,00:33:05.483,"No. Darlin', you listen to Daddy."
00:33:05.566,00:33:07.235,You go do that 'cause we're going on an adventure.
00:33:08.403,00:33:09.988,Like the time we went camping in the parish?
00:33:10.071,00:33:11.114,"Not actually, but..."
00:33:11.197,00:33:12.949,'Cause every adventure is different.
00:33:13.199,00:33:15.785,"Oh, my God. You're actually serious right now."
00:33:15.868,00:33:18.246,"Barry, it's 4:00 a.m., I'm not moving."
00:33:18.955,00:33:20.540,Christina's school play is tomorrow.
00:33:20.665,00:33:22.291,"Hey, do you trust me?"
00:33:22.834,00:33:23.668,No!
00:33:25.461,00:33:28.047,But you love me. You do love me.
00:33:31.676,00:33:34.012,"Yeah, of course, I fucking love you."
00:33:34.095,00:33:36.055,"Then, listen, we gotta move."
00:33:37.515,00:33:40.810,And we gotta get outta here before the sun comes up.
00:34:36.908,00:34:39.243,Look at that. They got barbecue.
00:34:48.169,00:34:50.213,It's got a lot of charm.
00:34:51.923,00:34:54.383,This place has got a lot of charm.
00:35:02.725,00:35:05.937,And I think that'd be cruel and unusual punishment. Right?
00:35:07.105,00:35:10.858,"Well, I'll be sure to give 'em a good what for on Monday, though."
00:35:10.942,00:35:11.776,All right?
00:35:56.404,00:35:58.322,That's... That's an easy fix.
00:36:15.256,00:36:16.090,I gotta...
00:36:22.180,00:36:24.015,Get in. Come on.
00:36:26.058,00:36:27.185,"Oh, shit."
00:36:29.770,00:36:31.772,We gotta make this quick.
00:36:32.857,00:36:34.817,She might leave me before I get back.
00:36:43.910,00:36:47.914,"So, this is all yours."
00:36:47.997,00:36:50.875,Including everything between here and your house.
00:36:50.958,00:36:53.252,"Almost 2,000 acres."
00:36:53.336,00:36:55.004,What do you think?
00:36:57.882,00:36:59.050,I own all this?
00:36:59.675,00:37:00.509,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:06.349,00:37:07.892,This whole airport?
00:37:07.975,00:37:10.311,Yeah. Congratulations.
00:37:37.713,00:37:39.674,Soviet-made for the PLO.
00:37:40.633,00:37:45.596,The Israelis captured these and then secretly traded them to us.
00:37:46.681,00:37:49.642,And you're gonna fly 'em to Nicaragua.
00:37:49.725,00:37:51.560,"Uh, you didn't say nothing about guns."
00:37:52.228,00:37:54.188,"It's a war, Barry."
00:37:54.355,00:37:57.566,Freedom fighters can't put up much of a fight if they aren't armed.
00:37:58.401,00:38:00.027,This was the deal.
00:38:00.194,00:38:03.114,Or would you rather be in a Colombian prison?
00:38:05.032,00:38:09.287,This is every current law enforcement investigation on the Gulf Coast.
00:38:09.829,00:38:12.873,"FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs."
00:38:14.500,00:38:17.003,These maps will help you avoid all of 'em.
00:38:17.795,00:38:19.630,Holy shit.
00:38:20.381,00:38:23.426,You'd just fly where they ain't.
00:38:38.274,00:38:40.234,Everything in this hangar's mine?
00:38:40.651,00:38:41.736,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:42.320,00:38:44.405,-That truck's mine? -Mmm-hmm.
00:38:44.780,00:38:45.614,Tools are mine?
00:38:46.324,00:38:47.575,"Yes, sir."
00:38:47.658,00:38:49.452,This airplane's mine.
00:38:52.121,00:38:53.831,Bag is mine.
00:38:55.541,00:38:56.584,What bag?
00:39:23.402,00:39:24.820,They're sleeping.
00:39:26.781,00:39:28.115,Unpacked the car.
00:39:29.033,00:39:30.284,That's good.
00:39:30.493,00:39:32.828,Fixed the sink. Just a valve.
00:39:33.954,00:39:36.332,See? I told you that was gonna be easy.
00:39:38.626,00:39:39.668,"Fuck, Barry!"
00:39:40.044,00:39:42.546,Okay. All right! All right. Okay.
00:39:43.964,00:39:45.508,I'm gonna come clean.
00:39:47.510,00:39:49.220,I don't work for TWA no more.
00:39:49.345,00:39:50.596,"No shit, Barry."
00:39:51.514,00:39:53.057,Are you going to prison?
00:39:58.437,00:40:00.064,You've gotta take care of this family.
00:40:00.523,00:40:01.357,'Cause I will take the kids.
00:40:01.440,00:40:04.568,I will go right back to working for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
00:40:04.819,00:40:08.155,"Luce, what I'm working on, it's-- Barry, I am six months pregnant."
00:40:08.239,00:40:09.073,It's top secret.
00:40:09.156,00:40:10.408,I need a fridge.
00:40:10.783,00:40:12.368,I need beds for our children.
00:40:12.451,00:40:15.246,"I need a stove, a fucking washing machine..."
00:40:21.919,00:40:23.963,"Washing machine over there, all right?"
00:40:26.006,00:40:27.758,"Now, let me just..."
00:40:36.559,00:40:38.310,Is this all legal?
00:40:38.394,00:40:42.356,"All right. What I'm about to tell you, you... You..."
00:40:43.023,00:40:46.944,"You gotta swear you can't ever tell anybody this, Lucy."
00:40:48.737,00:40:49.572,All right?
00:40:54.493,00:40:56.537,for the CIA.
00:42:07.942,00:42:08.984,"Howdy, amigos."
00:42:09.443,00:42:12.446,I am here on behalf of Uncle Sam.
00:42:25.876,00:42:27.836,but are you sure these are the right guys?
00:42:28.170,00:42:31.715,'Cause they seemed a damn sight more interested in my boots than in your guns.
00:42:34.218,00:42:35.970,"Schafer, I just don't think I'm the guy for this."
00:42:36.053,00:42:37.555,"You just keep delivering that pizza, hear me?"
00:42:37.680,00:42:39.515,You just keep delivering.
00:42:53.320,00:42:54.697,All right.
00:42:55.739,00:42:57.199,These are gifts.
00:42:58.909,00:43:00.077,All right?
00:43:00.703,00:43:02.371,All right? Gifts.
00:43:12.840,00:43:13.674,Amigos.
00:43:18.721,00:43:23.434,"Now, these guns are gifts from Uncle Sam."
00:43:31.233,00:43:32.526,I'm not fucking around.
00:43:34.903,00:43:37.489,"Barry! Put the bat down, huevón."
00:43:37.865,00:43:39.241,We're all friends here.
00:43:39.783,00:43:40.951,Jorge.
00:43:41.577,00:43:43.412,What the hell are you doing here?
00:43:45.247,00:43:49.168,He works for your government on the revolution to bring down the Sandinistas.
00:43:49.293,00:43:53.339,Jorge tells me you are the crazy gringo who always delivers.
00:43:57.426,00:44:03.599,"You bring your American guns to Colombia, deliver our cocaine here, to the Contras."
00:44:04.141,00:44:06.393,The Contras take it by fishing boats to Miami...
00:44:07.811,00:44:09.313,And everybody's happy.
00:44:09.813,00:44:12.858,"It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal."
00:44:18.489,00:44:19.907,They just wanted to make money.
00:44:20.157,00:44:21.659,Like the rest of us.
00:44:21.742,00:44:25.454,"Meanwhile, the Medellín Cartel wanted guns."
00:44:25.537,00:44:28.332,So they worked out a little trade. What was I gonna tell 'em?
00:44:29.833,00:44:32.586,I'm just a gringo who always delivers.
00:44:33.170,00:44:34.797,Here's how the operation worked.
00:44:35.130,00:44:43.514,"I'd load up with guns in Mena, then, using Schafer's intel, I'd bypass any law enforcement and fly straight to the Cartel's airstrip in Medellín."
00:44:50.854,00:44:52.439,And I'd load up with fresh powder...
00:44:53.065,00:44:55.401,and fly on to the Contra training camp.
00:44:56.026,00:45:00.406,The Contras hid the coke in fishing boats and sailed it up to Miami.
00:45:01.073,00:45:10.124,"Meanwhile, I'd get another load of powder, take it back to the States with a quick stop to refuel in Panama under the protection of my old friend, Colonel Noriega."
00:45:10.249,00:45:12.334,"Congratulations on your promotion, General."
00:45:12.876,00:45:15.546,"'Course, he'd get his cut, too."
00:45:16.380,00:45:20.884,"On the way back, I'd keep an eye out for the DEA and then I'd dump it all in the swamps of Louisiana."
00:45:26.432,00:45:29.393,"The operation got so big, I had to get some help."
00:45:30.436,00:45:35.649,Pete Dubois manufactured guns until he discovered he had a knack for selling pot.
00:45:35.732,00:45:39.486,Stan Mason flew dope from Mexico to Arizona.
00:45:39.570,00:45:44.241,Bill Cooper. He flew opium all around Southeast Asia during Vietnam.
00:45:45.033,00:45:46.660,Then there's Bob. Uh...
00:45:47.244,00:45:50.330,"I don't know much about Bob. Hell of a pilot, though."
00:45:51.415,00:45:56.670,"I called these boys my Snowbirds, and we could fly through anything."
00:46:21.195,00:46:22.029,Schafer!
00:46:22.946,00:46:24.114,Barry.
00:46:24.990,00:46:25.949,How's it going?
00:46:34.458,00:46:36.960,"How's it, uh... How's it going down there?"
00:46:38.378,00:46:39.755,"Oh, you know..."
00:46:40.214,00:46:41.048,Busy.
00:46:44.218,00:46:45.302,You?
00:46:46.512,00:46:47.429,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:49.306,00:46:50.474,Busy.
00:46:59.650,00:47:00.943,Where are they going?
00:47:02.444,00:47:04.905,We need to borrow some of your land.
00:47:06.698,00:47:10.202,They want you to fly 'em up here to... To train.
00:47:10.285,00:47:11.787,For training.
00:47:12.704,00:47:13.539,Who?
00:47:14.623,00:47:15.832,The Contras.
00:47:20.337,00:47:22.339,You... You want me to bring 'em up here?
00:47:22.548,00:47:23.382,To Mena?
00:47:24.258,00:47:27.094,We're setting up a field and operational training ground.
00:47:33.225,00:47:34.309,Where? On...
00:47:35.102,00:47:36.812,-On my land? -Yeah.
00:47:37.563,00:47:38.647,Starting immediately.
00:47:39.022,00:47:39.898,Which is great.
00:47:42.359,00:47:43.402,Is that a problem?
00:47:43.986,00:47:44.987,No.
00:47:45.195,00:47:46.321,Hey...
00:47:47.197,00:47:48.365,"Whatever you need, boss."
00:48:26.486,00:48:28.530,Hang on! We're supposed to have 15.
00:48:28.614,00:48:29.865,I'm only counting 12 here.
00:48:29.948,00:48:32.826,Them Contras were damn excited about being in the U.S. of A.
00:48:33.619,00:48:36.496,And they were running away almost faster than we could bring 'em in.
00:48:44.379,00:48:46.840,Wow. You wanna quadruple the shipments?
00:48:47.090,00:48:50.802,We're confident the Contras can win by summer if we give 'em what they need.
00:48:50.969,00:48:51.970,That's great.
00:48:56.308,00:48:57.434,That's what I like to hear.
00:48:58.352,00:49:00.937,"We're expanding operations, Barry."
00:49:02.397,00:49:05.192,"Just one at a time! Hey, hold on! Hold on!"
00:49:07.486,00:49:09.029,We'll take care of everybody.
00:49:13.367,00:49:15.327,"Please. Back! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:49:46.483,00:49:47.442,Yeah?
00:49:47.526,00:49:49.236,You think those Contras can win?
00:49:51.238,00:49:52.072,No.
00:49:54.116,00:49:55.117,Eh...
00:49:58.662,00:50:01.832,This just came. Go Razorbacks. Barry.
00:50:02.332,00:50:03.291,Season tickets.
00:50:03.792,00:50:05.794,Fifty-yard line.
00:50:06.712,00:50:08.171,"Well, that was awful nice of him."
00:50:08.755,00:50:11.591,How much property has Seal bought up since he came to town?
00:50:12.592,00:50:14.428,"I don't know, 500 acres?"
00:50:14.553,00:50:17.723,Two thousand acres. From the airport to Ouachita.
00:50:17.889,00:50:19.599,What's he want with all that worthless land?
00:50:19.725,00:50:23.353,"It's... It's really none of our business, really."
00:50:26.523,00:50:29.151,"He's good people, Judy."
00:50:29.234,00:50:31.862,He's doing a lot for the community.
00:50:37.617,00:50:39.786,I'd like to open a bank account.
00:50:39.995,00:50:42.038,Oh. Bless you!
00:50:42.873,00:50:44.166,I'll be right back.
00:50:44.541,00:50:45.584,David!
00:50:56.052,00:50:57.471,Whoo!
00:50:59.473,00:51:01.141,Oranges. You guys want some oranges?
00:51:05.187,00:51:08.190,Here you go! All right. Let me just put this right...
00:51:13.904,00:51:15.322,There you go.
00:51:21.661,00:51:23.121,"-Nice wheels! -Oh, you like her?"
00:51:24.581,00:51:26.041,1982.
00:51:26.124,00:51:27.542,All the bells and whistles.
00:51:27.626,00:51:30.962,"First one in the state of Arkansas, and she's yours."
00:51:31.505,00:51:32.923,She's mine?
00:51:33.298,00:51:34.341,She's yours.
00:51:34.424,00:51:36.218,"Oh, my God, Barry!"
00:51:37.427,00:51:38.762,Thank you!
00:51:40.388,00:51:43.558,-Wow. -A little something extra in there.
00:51:44.726,00:51:46.144,"Fuck me, Barry!"
00:51:50.065,00:51:51.233,What?
00:51:52.609,00:51:54.361,Okay. You need to behave.
00:52:03.078,00:52:04.996,business was a-boomin'.
00:52:08.834,00:52:11.336,"Got us at Tuesday, three o'clock. Tuesday at three o'clock."
00:52:13.463,00:52:14.881,Can you add a Friday delivery?
00:52:17.467,00:52:18.301,Yeah?
00:52:18.385,00:52:19.928,We wanna double the amount of guns we're bringing in.
00:52:29.646,00:52:34.484,"I can't wait to learn everything there is to know about the sign business, Mr. Seal."
00:52:34.651,00:52:35.569,"Me, too."
00:52:35.735,00:52:38.405,I spent 30 years working the pumps at Gas N' Sip.
00:52:38.613,00:52:41.283,"Well, sir, I think it's about time you moved to upper management."
00:52:41.408,00:52:44.119,But the money was coming in faster than I could launder it.
00:53:00.051,00:53:02.345,dropping off and picking up.
00:53:17.652,00:53:19.029,What're you doing? Barry!
00:53:32.208,00:53:33.835,What'd I tell you? You think I'm gonna forget that?
00:53:33.919,00:53:35.170,Your husband is a genius.
00:53:35.629,00:53:38.548,"Well, it absolutely, positively has to be delivered overnight."
00:53:39.549,00:53:40.634,"Esposa, Lucy."
00:54:28.598,00:54:34.688,"Ten million in Mena National, twelve million in Mena State, fifteen in Mena Trust."
00:54:34.771,00:54:44.990,"I had 40 parked in Miami, twenty in Panama, seven million in lawn bags, eight in Samsonites, four buried in the woods behind my house, and 90 pounds of gold in my closet."
00:54:46.241,00:54:47.367,Hot damn!
00:54:47.450,00:54:48.451,"Oh, honey, watch the yoke."
00:54:49.661,00:54:52.664,If this ain't the greatest country in the world.
00:54:52.747,00:54:53.957,Ah!
00:55:08.013,00:55:09.180,JB.
00:55:13.935,00:55:15.228,Uh...
00:55:17.522,00:55:18.606,Yeah.
00:55:19.524,00:55:21.192,"-Hey, sis! -JB!"
00:55:23.319,00:55:24.571,Look at you!
00:55:24.654,00:55:26.489,-Look at you! -God damn!
00:55:26.573,00:55:27.615,Get in here.
00:55:27.824,00:55:29.451,Look at this fucking house!
00:55:29.701,00:55:31.578,"Parking a Chevy's a lot harder than it fucking looks, Luce."
00:55:31.661,00:55:33.121,Hey! Watch your mouth around the kids.
00:55:37.250,00:55:38.501,That right?
00:55:40.378,00:55:44.049,They had me cramming those S-10s into every goddamn inch of the parking lot...
00:55:45.884,00:55:47.218,I'm sorry!
00:55:48.053,00:55:55.852,"Look, the thing is, is that the cars were so close to each other, right, Then they would take the scratches out of my fucking paycheck, man!"
00:55:57.979,00:56:00.273,"Well, I don't know how you handle the pressure, JB."
00:56:00.398,00:56:02.484,"You're staying here, you're getting a job."
00:56:02.567,00:56:05.361,"Or, you know, I could just give you some folding cash, you go on and do what you want."
00:56:07.447,00:56:10.200,"You are getting a job, JB, not a handout."
00:56:10.742,00:56:12.410,"My brother's getting a job, Barry."
00:56:12.702,00:56:13.828,You're getting a job.
00:56:14.329,00:56:15.371,Definitely.
00:56:15.455,00:56:18.249,"Well, you hear that? That's the law."
00:56:18.958,00:56:20.126,"You're gonna have to work, son."
00:56:29.469,00:56:30.804,"Yo, Barry!"
00:56:32.263,00:56:33.890,"Hey, Barry."
00:56:34.265,00:56:35.308,Barry!
00:56:35.433,00:56:36.518,"What now, JB?"
00:56:36.601,00:56:39.729,"So this is a big hangar, and I'm tired of sweeping."
00:56:40.271,00:56:41.564,You can take a break when you get it done.
00:56:41.815,00:56:42.982,Let's go. Get it done!
00:56:45.110,00:56:46.111,"Get me a beer, man."
00:56:46.736,00:56:48.154,Dead soldier.
00:56:48.321,00:56:49.656,Here's your fucking...
00:57:15.807,00:57:16.808,Yeah?
00:57:16.975,00:57:19.144,Roscoe dug this up in the backyard.
00:57:19.519,00:57:21.855,There are bills blowing around everywhere.
00:57:21.980,00:57:23.857,I'll rake it up in the morning.
00:57:23.982,00:57:26.693,I found three more of 'em up in the fireplace.
00:58:00.685,00:58:01.853,Shit.
00:58:12.780,00:58:16.242,We had cash flooding in from every direction.
00:58:18.036,00:58:20.580,Who... Who thought that was gonna be a problem? I mean...
00:58:21.289,00:58:24.042,We were running out of places to put it.
00:58:27.545,00:58:29.130,Easy. Whoa.
00:58:29.547,00:58:31.549,Don't get behind 'em. These are dangerous animals.
00:58:31.633,00:58:32.592,"You know, maybe you should call the trainer."
00:58:32.675,00:58:34.302,"No, honey, I got this."
00:58:34.511,00:58:35.595,"Come on, now."
00:58:35.720,00:58:37.180,Hang on.
00:58:48.733,00:58:50.818,JB got a new car.
00:58:50.902,00:58:52.737,Did you give that boy a raise?
00:58:57.784,00:58:59.494,What in the holy fuck?
00:58:59.577,00:59:01.454,That girl is 15.
00:59:03.081,00:59:04.999,-It's huge! -I told you it was huge!
00:59:05.083,00:59:07.252,-You actually live here? -Uh-huh.
00:59:07.335,00:59:09.921,Hey! Can I talk to you for a second?
00:59:10.421,00:59:11.589,Yeah.
00:59:12.257,00:59:13.341,-What? -Come here.
00:59:14.717,00:59:15.635,What?
00:59:16.010,00:59:17.178,I haven't done nothing yet!
00:59:17.262,00:59:18.763,"-JB. Come on. -Hi, Miss Seal."
00:59:19.013,00:59:19.847,Hi.
00:59:19.931,00:59:22.559,What... We were just gonna go for a swim.
00:59:22.809,00:59:23.893,Come here.
00:59:23.977,00:59:25.395,Please don't tell my mama that I was here.
00:59:26.646,00:59:28.940,Where'd you get the money for this car?
00:59:35.613,00:59:39.492,"I'm gonna be honest with you, Barry, 'cause I can't lie to you."
00:59:40.952,00:59:43.037,I stole it from the hangar.
00:59:45.415,00:59:46.416,All right.
00:59:47.000,00:59:49.377,I opened up one of the Samsonites.
00:59:49.460,00:59:50.837,"I found so much fucking money in there, man."
00:59:50.920,00:59:52.839,"-JB, JB, JB. -So much goddamn money."
00:59:52.922,00:59:54.966,"JB, you can't do that."
00:59:55.508,00:59:56.634,You can't do that.
01:00:00.513,01:00:01.556,Watch out for that tree at the end.
01:00:08.646,01:00:11.149,"No, Pete, you gotta turn that off. I can't see nothing with it on."
01:00:12.984,01:00:15.486,Seventy-five. Fifty.
01:00:39.969,01:00:41.763,You boys see this?

01:01:02.992,01:01:04.827,"Let's go back out to sea, 105 knots."
01:01:04.911,01:01:06.162,Get them flaps down.
01:01:19.717,01:01:21.469,but we could go slow.
01:01:22.428,01:01:24.555,For a long time.
01:01:45.785,01:01:48.329,Those pricks are right fucking there!
01:01:54.001,01:01:57.422,DEA finally ran out of gas. Time to head home.
01:02:10.143,01:02:11.686,"Where you headed, buddy? Come on."
01:02:17.692,01:02:21.446,"Bill? Come on, turn around. Come on, let's go."
01:02:22.447,01:02:24.866,Bill? You hear me?
01:02:27.910,01:02:29.579,"Oh, son of a bitch!"

01:03:05.782,01:03:06.616,Thanks.
01:03:08.326,01:03:11.829,"I think you're gonna appreciate what we've done here, Barry."
01:03:17.335,01:03:19.128,You're making me my own vault?
01:03:19.212,01:03:23.174,"Oh, no, no. We're using this auxiliary for all our other customers."
01:03:26.761,01:03:29.013,We gave you the main vault.
01:03:32.642,01:03:33.684,How 'bout that!
01:04:20.523,01:04:22.775,Head for New Orleans Naval Air Station at once.
01:04:25.444,01:04:26.654,"Yeah. Come on, come on, come on!"
01:04:27.280,01:04:28.823,"You better run, you prick."
01:04:50.845,01:04:53.556,I see you finally got smart and got a slower plane.
01:04:59.270,01:05:00.313,Two of 'em.

01:05:19.165,01:05:20.124,What the fuck?
01:05:22.293,01:05:23.461,Stay on him.
01:05:57.119,01:05:58.120,Shit!
01:06:34.907,01:06:36.575,Is this your yard?
01:06:40.371,01:06:42.540,"All right. Well, that's for the damage."
01:06:42.623,01:06:45.334,"And, uh, here's a little something extra for your sister."
01:06:45.418,01:06:46.627,"Hey, little darlin'."

01:07:10.484,01:07:11.694,Two hundred.
01:07:11.777,01:07:13.779,-Right. -Is that your boy?
01:07:14.739,01:07:17.366,"I'm sorry, are you working for the fucking DEA now?"
01:07:18.534,01:07:19.869,Interesting read.
01:07:27.460,01:07:28.294,I got it.
01:07:33.382,01:07:35.760,We had to get out of Colombia in the middle of the night.
01:07:45.686,01:07:47.730,the cartel found themselves kicked out of Colombia.
01:07:57.156,01:07:59.033,The only place the DEA couldn't touch him?
01:07:59.825,01:08:01.410,That's right. Nicaragua.
01:08:06.999,01:08:08.667,He's the Minister of Interiors.
01:08:08.751,01:08:10.586,He controls the airstrips.
01:08:10.711,01:08:12.338,It's how we get you in.
01:08:49.458,01:08:50.918,"-Here's your butter, sir. -Thank you."

01:09:39.550,01:09:40.676,Stop running!
01:10:10.497,01:10:12.625,"-Honey? You all right? -Yeah, I can hear you."
01:10:12.791,01:10:15.502,"Honey, I hate to tell you this right now, but JB has been arrested."
01:10:22.593,01:10:24.428,"There ain't nothing to do, really. Uh..."
01:10:24.803,01:10:27.973,I'm just in a meeting. And we'll go over that when I get home.
01:10:28.098,01:10:29.391,All right? I'll take care of that.
01:10:29.475,01:10:30.768,"All right. Hurry, Barry."
01:10:30.851,01:10:32.895,All right? You just sit tight. I love you.

01:10:53.374,01:10:56.293,"Well, we ain't never done that before. That's..."
01:10:59.713,01:11:01.090,Can you do it?
01:11:02.216,01:11:04.927,"Yeah, I'm gonna... I'm gonna get home."
01:11:05.010,01:11:07.846,"Right now. I'm gonna leave, and then... we'll figure it out."
01:11:08.013,01:11:09.139,I'll figure it out.
01:11:11.308,01:11:12.768,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
01:11:16.188,01:11:18.190,Get it fucking done!
01:11:21.610,01:11:23.612,Fucking lawyer doesn't know shit.
01:11:23.737,01:11:26.699,"I got two fucking priors, man, and he doesn't understand."
01:11:26.782,01:11:28.659,"No, no, no. He does understand."
01:11:32.705,01:11:36.959,"One more strike, man, one more strike and I could go to prison -for life, man. -JB?"
01:11:37.209,01:11:38.752,"JB, just hold on."
01:11:41.630,01:11:43.716,"Barry? Barry, are you there?"
01:11:45.843,01:11:47.011,"Hey, darlin'."
01:11:48.554,01:11:49.596,What's that? Hold on.
01:11:51.140,01:11:52.641,"We've been trying to get a hold of you, amigo."
01:11:52.725,01:11:53.559,"Yeah, I know that, amigo."
01:11:53.642,01:11:55.436,"Listen, could you hold on? I'll be right back."
01:12:04.528,01:12:06.071,There's some people that wanna talk to me.
01:12:06.196,01:12:09.199,"No, no, no. You don't talk to anyone about anything."
01:12:10.159,01:12:13.787,"Now, you do what that lawyer tells you to, and you keep your fuckin' mouth shut."
01:12:13.871,01:12:15.039,I'm taking care of this.
01:12:15.122,01:12:16.165,Okay.

01:12:20.294,01:12:21.712,We gotta put on the brakes for a bit.
01:12:21.795,01:12:24.131,"Brakes? No, no, no. No brakes."
01:12:24.256,01:12:25.424,We have product to move.
01:12:25.507,01:12:27.968,"I understand, amigo. But I got a family situation."
01:12:28.052,01:12:30.596,Your brother-in-law? We know all about it.
01:12:30.763,01:12:31.972,"We'll handle it, amigo."
01:12:32.264,01:12:35.225,"No, no, no. I don't want you to handle it."
01:12:35.392,01:12:36.477,"Barry, listen."
01:12:36.560,01:12:38.187,-I got it. I got this. -Barry.
01:12:38.604,01:12:41.357,Listen to me. We'll handle it. Okay?
01:12:41.440,01:12:42.691,"-No, no, no. Jorge-- -So don't worry."
01:12:42.775,01:12:44.777,-Jorge... Jorge... -We'll talk business later.
01:13:17.559,01:13:18.852,or what you got in them planes.
01:13:18.936,01:13:21.146,The guns you got. They don't know anything about it.
01:13:21.438,01:13:22.815,"We're good, man."
01:13:22.898,01:13:24.691,"I can't fix this, you hear?"
01:13:26.527,01:13:29.738,They're gonna give you ten... Ten years for not talking.
01:13:30.989,01:13:32.950,That's ten years people gotta worry you will.
01:13:33.033,01:13:34.535,"But I didn't say anything, man!"
01:13:34.618,01:13:36.787,You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.
01:13:40.499,01:13:42.251,"Where we going, man?"
01:13:46.130,01:13:49.216,Jesus Christ! I'm fuckin' family.

01:14:01.186,01:14:02.563,We're family.
01:14:04.273,01:14:05.357,What's this?

01:14:10.237,01:14:12.614,Enough cash to make a damn good life for yourself.
01:14:13.782,01:14:19.538,"Now, you're gonna get in that car and you're gonna drive straight to Dallas/Fort Worth airport."
01:14:19.705,01:14:21.039,And nowhere else.
01:14:22.875,01:14:26.044,You don't even stop to take a piss. You hear me?
01:14:26.211,01:14:27.713,"Yeah, I hear you."
01:14:31.675,01:14:33.010,"Good luck, kid."
01:14:43.979,01:14:45.522,"I'll tell you what, Barry."
01:14:45.814,01:14:48.442,"I'm gonna send you a goddamn address. Okay, Barry?"
01:14:48.567,01:14:51.528,You're gonna start sending me cash on the fucking regular.
01:14:51.612,01:14:53.906,You understand? You hear me?
01:14:54.698,01:14:57.284,"Fuckin' goddamn fuckin' dick, all high-and-mighty."

01:16:41.054,01:16:42.139,Don't worry about JB.
01:16:45.267,01:16:46.560,He ain't gonna.
01:16:48.895,01:16:50.939,"He ain't gonna talk, Bill."
01:16:51.064,01:16:52.733,How do you know?
01:16:53.108,01:16:55.694,I am fucking positive!
01:17:02.659,01:17:04.870,"Good. I'm gonna trust you on this one, man."
01:17:04.953,01:17:05.996,Good.
01:17:15.130,01:17:18.008,"10,500 Russian AKs to the Contras."
01:17:18.133,01:17:18.967,Yeah.
01:17:19.051,01:17:24.514,Five thousand of which have found themselves in the hands of the Colombian cartel.
01:17:24.598,01:17:25.557,Right. But...
01:17:25.641,01:17:31.980,"Out of the 916 Contras brought into the United States to train, only half made it back to Nicaragua."
01:17:32.147,01:17:34.358,-Half is-- -The other half are in the wild.
01:17:59.758,01:18:01.551,What's going on here?
01:18:01.802,01:18:04.721,"Oh, yeah, the... We had to send the Contras home."
01:18:08.558,01:18:10.394,They weren't fighting.
01:18:10.852,01:18:13.480,That's the reality of that situation.
01:18:18.902,01:18:20.153,"Did it, Barry?"
01:18:31.373,01:18:32.499,So...
01:18:37.212,01:18:38.046,What now?
01:18:38.422,01:18:40.298,Mmm. We'll call ya.
01:18:43.260,01:18:44.261,Call me?
01:18:45.262,01:18:46.430,Schafer?
01:18:47.097,01:18:48.140,"Hey, Schafer!"
01:18:48.223,01:18:50.058,Who the fuck's Schafer?
01:18:56.189,01:18:59.651,"Okay, everybody, you know the drill. Everybody gets a burn bag."
01:18:59.735,01:19:04.531,"Into it, you put anything with Barry Seal's face or name on it."
01:19:08.326,01:19:09.911,"Come on, boys. We gotta move."
01:19:10.036,01:19:11.955,We gotta get all this stuff out of here.
01:19:13.874,01:19:15.917,"Come on, boys, let's go. We gotta move this out."
01:19:16.084,01:19:17.627,Let's go! Let's go!
01:19:20.046,01:19:23.300,Purchase orders. Aircraft invoices.
01:19:23.383,01:19:25.135,Be a team here. Let's move it out.
01:19:26.011,01:19:27.179,"Holy shit, man."
01:19:27.262,01:19:29.723,Look at all these guns. We gotta move all of it.
01:19:29.890,01:19:31.391,Where we supposed to put all of this stuff?
01:19:31.558,01:19:33.143,Just get it off my property.
01:19:33.268,01:19:34.811,Anything with the word Mena.
01:19:34.978,01:19:39.399,"Fuel bills, memos, names, directives, photos."
01:19:39.483,01:19:40.525,Anything like that.
01:19:40.609,01:19:43.320,"Anything which can link us with him, you put it in the burn bag."
01:19:43.403,01:19:44.654,And then what do you do with it?
01:19:56.249,01:19:58.210,Back away from the truck with your hands in the air.
01:20:00.253,01:20:01.546,-Show us your hands! -Drop the fucking box!
01:20:04.674,01:20:05.884,ATF!
01:20:06.551,01:20:07.636,Drop your weapons!
01:20:07.719,01:20:09.721,"-Whoa, whoa, whoa! DEA! -Lower your guns!"
01:20:09.805,01:20:11.431,ATF! Put your guns down!
01:20:11.515,01:20:12.516,Stand down!
01:20:17.062,01:20:18.230,"No, no, no."
01:20:20.607,01:20:23.443,What the fuck are y'all doing in my county?
01:20:32.244,01:20:33.453,FBI!
01:20:33.954,01:20:34.996,"Ah, fuck."
01:20:42.879,01:20:45.715,"Well, hey, boys, how about my phone call?"
01:20:52.180,01:20:55.100,You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service.
01:20:55.183,01:20:56.101,"Oh, shit."
01:20:56.184,01:21:00.397,"If you feel you have reached this recording in error, -please check the number and try... -Come on, Seal."
01:21:10.115,01:21:11.408,"You know who I am, Mr. Seal?"
01:21:12.868,01:21:13.702,"No, ma'am."
01:21:13.994,01:21:17.205,"I'm Dana Sibota, State Attorney General."
01:21:17.455,01:21:22.085,"You've got DEA, ATF, FBI, all wanting their pound of flesh."
01:21:22.627,01:21:24.671,"Yes, ma'am, it's... It's quite a room."
01:21:25.422,01:21:27.841,"Yeah. Well, you hit the trifecta, didn't you?"
01:21:28.300,01:21:31.011,"I mean, guns, drugs, money laundering."
01:21:31.553,01:21:35.849,"And the state of Arkansas is gonna rip the bark right off of you, boy."
01:21:36.224,01:21:40.478,We are gonna put you in a four-by-six cell for the rest of your life.
01:21:41.187,01:21:42.397,"Ma'am, that's a long time."
01:21:42.564,01:21:43.398,Yeah.
01:21:49.905,01:21:51.615,He says it's urgent.
01:21:55.869,01:21:57.537,It's the Governor.
01:21:59.748,01:22:00.624,It's your governor.
01:22:02.834,01:22:05.253,Put him through. Clear the room. Take him with you.
01:22:05.337,01:22:06.171,Yeah?
01:22:07.255,01:22:08.548,"What do you need, Bill?"
01:22:09.674,01:22:12.344,that Caddies have more trunk space than any other car in the world?
01:22:13.303,01:22:15.639,I'll get each and every one of you a Caddy.
01:22:17.974,01:22:19.100,You'd do that for all of us?
01:22:19.184,01:22:20.810,"Yes, sir. I would."
01:22:20.936,01:22:22.896,I'd get all y'all Caddies. Have 'em here this afternoon.
01:22:22.979,01:22:24.981,"What are you trying to do, Seal? Add another 20 for bribery?"
01:22:26.191,01:22:28.026,I'm just offering y'all Caddies for your troubles.
01:22:28.109,01:22:30.111,"What troubles, Seal, hmm?"
01:22:30.236,01:22:31.988,"Well, bringing me down here, for one."
01:22:32.072,01:22:32.906,You see...
01:22:34.115,01:22:36.201,I'm gonna walk out of here.
01:22:37.702,01:22:39.788,I'm gonna walk out of here.
01:22:40.497,01:22:43.583,And there ain't a damn thing any one of you can do about it.
01:22:55.929,01:22:56.763,Do it.
01:22:58.014,01:23:00.058,"-Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. -No, no."
01:23:00.141,01:23:01.893,"-No, he's free to go, boys. -What the fuck?"
01:23:08.191,01:23:10.276,You boys should've taken the Caddies.
01:23:13.530,01:23:14.948,"I'll be seeing you, Seal."
01:23:16.825,01:23:17.993,Ma'am.
01:23:21.454,01:23:24.082,"it is good to see you boys, I ain't gonna lie."
01:23:24.165,01:23:26.668,"But I figured you'd have to show up, see?"
01:23:26.751,01:23:28.420,'Cause I just know too much.
01:23:28.545,01:23:30.588,"Schafer sent you, right?"
01:23:30.839,01:23:32.799,Who the fuck is Schafer?
01:23:48.356,01:23:49.733,"All right, all right now."
01:23:49.816,01:23:51.943,"Seriously, fellas, who are you?"
01:24:00.326,01:24:07.208,"Usually, I talk with you from my office in the West Wing of the White House, but tonight, there's something special to talk about."
01:24:07.292,01:24:09.586,And I've asked someone very special to join me.
01:24:13.381,01:24:14.841,Are we going...
01:24:21.347,01:24:26.227,"Not long ago, I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs."
01:24:26.478,01:24:28.855,"And I answered, Just say no."
01:24:29.272,01:24:31.566,Drug criminals are ingenious.
01:24:31.691,01:24:35.653,So we must be smarter and stronger and tougher than they are.
01:24:36.112,01:24:38.198,Say yes to your life.
01:24:38.281,01:24:42.202,"And when it comes to drugs and alcohol, just say no."
01:24:45.622,01:24:47.040,You a pilot?
01:24:48.249,01:24:49.834,I've been known to fly some.
01:24:49.918,01:24:51.169,"Me, too."
01:24:51.252,01:24:52.837,Air National Guard.
01:24:52.921,01:24:54.464,"-'68, '69. -Oh."
01:24:58.176,01:24:59.010,Well...
01:24:59.677,01:25:01.805,"I'll see you around, flyboy."
01:25:08.520,01:25:12.440,The Sandinistas are burning the American flag in the streets.
01:25:13.733,01:25:17.028,Please. There is no deal if we don't get the Sandinistas.
01:25:17.112,01:25:18.571,-Then there's no deal. -Horseshit.
01:25:18.655,01:25:20.115,There's no deal unless we get Medellín.
01:25:23.785,01:25:25.245,This is disgusting!
01:25:31.167,01:25:34.087,And this fella here is a colonel named Ollie North.
01:25:34.170,01:25:35.505,Reagan's go-to guy.
01:25:35.755,01:25:39.759,The DEA just wants to nail the Medellín Cartel once and for all.
01:25:39.843,01:25:45.348,"Now, at the same time, Colonel North wants to prove the commies in Central America are involved in the drug trade."
01:25:45.431,01:25:46.474,Let me say that again.
01:25:46.599,01:25:47.600,This is disgusting!
01:25:51.771,01:25:53.189,And why am I in the room?
01:25:54.607,01:25:57.110,'Cause I'm the gringo who always delivers.
01:25:57.485,01:26:00.280,"So, you want me to keep going?"
01:26:01.030,01:26:02.282,For your country.
01:26:03.658,01:26:05.827,We're gonna bring these guys down.
01:26:05.994,01:26:07.495,And you're gonna be a hero.
01:26:12.750,01:26:14.335,"All right, then."
01:26:17.005,01:26:19.299,They put me right back in business.
01:26:19.507,01:26:21.134,"Now, I'm working for the White House."
01:26:23.344,01:26:25.680,Fifty picture loads each.
01:26:25.763,01:26:27.515,You have one here in a bag.
01:26:27.682,01:26:31.352,The sightline goes straight down the back to where those gentlemen are now.
01:26:32.312,01:26:35.398,You have two more cameras above each door.
01:26:35.565,01:26:38.776,Sightlines directly in front of the door.
01:26:42.655,01:26:44.324,Each camera has a cord.
01:26:44.490,01:26:46.910,You just press this button to take a picture.
01:26:48.912,01:26:50.079,And that's it.
01:26:51.289,01:26:52.540,Let's go.
01:26:55.919,01:26:57.587,"I can see the cords, Barry."
01:26:58.421,01:26:59.255,Yeah.
01:27:02.675,01:27:06.429,"I can see this damn cord, which means they gonna be able to see it."
01:27:06.554,01:27:07.639,We'll hide it.
01:27:07.722,01:27:09.599,I'm not a photographer.
01:27:09.766,01:27:11.017,-Your thumb work? -Yeah.
01:27:11.100,01:27:12.268,"Well, you just push the button."
01:27:12.644,01:27:14.854,When am I supposed to push the button?
01:27:16.439,01:27:18.608,When the guys are standing here holding the powder.
01:27:19.108,01:27:21.611,"You know what? Fuck it, Pete. I'll take the pictures."
01:27:26.115,01:27:28.576,Who exactly is going to be looking at 'em?
01:27:28.660,01:27:30.828,These photos are gonna be on a need-to-know basis.
01:27:30.912,01:27:32.330,Need-to-know.
01:27:32.413,01:27:34.791,"They're gonna be classified at the highest levels, Barry."
01:27:40.255,01:27:42.966,We do recognize the dangers involved here.
01:27:46.552,01:27:48.054,"No, you don't."
01:27:50.306,01:27:54.018,"Well, you could always tell us to fuck off and spend the next 30 years in Leavenworth."
01:27:56.145,01:27:57.814,Let's get this over with!
01:28:03.820,01:28:05.488,"We'll see ya, Rangel."
01:29:07.633,01:29:10.803,Shit! There's a fucking army out there.
01:29:14.349,01:29:15.725,They're gonna torture us...
01:29:16.351,01:29:18.269,Pull our tongues out through our necks.
01:29:19.354,01:29:20.688,"That ain't helping, Pete."
01:29:20.772,01:29:24.192,They're gonna cut us up in little pieces and feed us to the pigs.
01:29:25.109,01:29:26.694,"I don't wanna be fed to no pigs, Barry."
01:29:27.862,01:29:30.031,Gotta keep our shit together. Hola!
01:29:33.910,01:29:39.207,"We're gonna get the yayo, take these damn pictures, then get the hell out of here."
01:29:39.540,01:29:41.292,Let's keep our shit together.
01:29:44.629,01:29:45.463,"No, no, no."
01:29:51.844,01:29:54.013,"They're going to hear that goddamn camera, Barry."
01:30:01.437,01:30:03.022,Escobar. Ochoa.
01:30:45.022,01:30:46.732,Jorge. Fuck!
01:30:46.899,01:30:47.942,"Come on, man."
01:30:49.694,01:30:50.695,A little help?
01:30:51.237,01:30:52.905,Shoot the gringos.
01:30:53.072,01:30:55.616,-What? -Shoot the gringos!
01:30:55.867,01:30:58.619,-What's that? -Shoot the gringos! Shoot the gringos!
01:31:11.799,01:31:12.758,You fucker.
01:31:24.604,01:31:26.689,"Pete, stand the fuck up."
01:31:29.192,01:31:30.902,Look at this! Hey!
01:31:31.736,01:31:33.404,"He pissed himself, man."
01:31:34.614,01:31:37.033,You got me. That was a good one.
01:31:37.200,01:31:38.075,That was a good one.
01:31:41.495,01:31:42.788,"I saved your life, Barry."
01:31:42.997,01:31:44.624,"-I saved your life, eh? -Yes, you did."
01:31:44.707,01:31:45.708,-Remember that. -Yeah.
01:31:45.791,01:31:47.835,Remember. Crazy gringo.
01:31:48.085,01:31:49.712,"Come here, Barry."
01:31:56.427,01:31:58.638,"Now, let's go say hi to Pablo."
01:31:59.388,01:32:00.556,Pablo's here?
01:32:00.723,01:32:03.142,"Sí. He's paranoid, amigo. On edge."
01:32:03.351,01:32:06.854,-Thinks everyone is out to get him. -Hola! Pablo!
01:32:16.697,01:32:17.740,What?
01:32:55.444,01:32:56.862,You really got me.
01:32:58.572,01:33:00.241,"Hey, you know, I'm gonna have to get you back."
01:33:11.294,01:33:12.545,"look at this, my friend."
01:33:28.394,01:33:30.813,Barry Seal! He's a goddamn genius.
01:33:33.190,01:33:36.986,There seems to be no crime to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.
01:33:40.406,01:33:44.327,The Sandinistas have even involved themselves in the international drug trade.
01:33:44.869,01:33:54.503,I know every American parent concerned about the drug problem will be outraged to learn that top Nicaraguan government officials are deeply involved in drug trafficking.
01:33:55.379,01:34:06.015,"This picture, secretly taken at a military airfield outside Managua shows Federico Vaughan, a top aide to one of the nine comandantes who rule Nicaragua..."
01:34:06.098,01:34:06.932,Fuck!
01:34:07.016,01:34:08.934,...loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics bound for the United States.
01:34:10.770,01:34:12.271,"That's your fucking face, Barry!"
01:34:12.355,01:34:14.648,This is an outlaw regime.
01:34:32.875,01:34:34.335,North jumped the gun.
01:34:34.418,01:34:37.004,"Yeah, well, you boys fucked me good."
01:34:37.088,01:34:37.922,We all got fucked.
01:34:38.130,01:34:42.343,"Those photos weren't supposed to be released, and certainly not until we had the Colombians in custody."
01:34:42.885,01:34:45.137,"Yeah, well, they ain't gonna be coming for you."
01:34:45.221,01:34:48.891,"Barry, you knew the risks when you took those pictures."
01:34:51.769,01:34:53.729,You knew what you were doing.
01:34:56.732,01:34:57.566,Barry?
01:35:00.027,01:35:01.445,"Barry, you there?"
01:35:17.169,01:35:19.213,Let's go get some ice cream.
01:35:34.311,01:35:35.396,When they come...
01:35:36.564,01:35:38.399,you gotta put on all your jewelry.
01:35:38.524,01:35:41.861,"All right? All your rings, you know, your bracelets."
01:35:43.320,01:35:44.780,Necklace.
01:35:45.906,01:35:49.368,"'Cause if you're wearing it, they can't take it away from you."
01:35:49.452,01:35:50.744,You understand?
01:35:52.121,01:35:54.415,"All right, that's insurance for you and the kids."
01:35:55.332,01:35:56.167,All right?
01:35:57.418,01:35:58.377,I understand.
01:35:58.461,01:36:01.547,All right. And don't forget that it's gonna be all right.
01:36:02.131,01:36:03.883,It's gonna be all right. I love you.
01:36:11.015,01:36:12.558,And they took it all.
01:36:30.910,01:36:32.369,"Hey, Luce, honey..."
01:36:32.995,01:36:33.829,I was thinking...
01:36:34.705,01:36:37.500,that you might like to move back to Baton Rouge.
01:36:41.003,01:36:43.672,"Try the hat boxes, third shelf up."
01:36:44.089,01:36:46.217,"I mean, you loved it there."
01:36:47.885,01:36:49.512,What about you?
01:36:50.095,01:36:51.222,"I mean, I'm..."
01:36:52.264,01:36:53.307,"Me, uh..."
01:36:54.266,01:36:55.768,"Listen, you see..."
01:36:58.354,01:37:00.189,"Look, if I run, they're, uh..."
01:37:01.899,01:37:04.193,"they're gonna come for you and the kids, I mean..."
01:37:06.362,01:37:11.075,"That's how a thing like this goes, but, Baton Rouge, you're safe."
01:37:14.703,01:37:15.871,No.
01:37:19.250,01:37:21.168,We're a family and we're staying together.
01:37:21.252,01:37:23.712,"I know. But-- No, sir. I ain't doing this."
01:37:23.796,01:37:25.047,"-Listen, Luce. Luce. -No."
01:37:25.130,01:37:27.967,"No, no. Honey, hang on. Don't do this now."
01:37:29.552,01:37:31.470,"No, no, no, sir. Come on, sir."
01:37:31.679,01:37:33.222,"Excuse me, she's wearing this now."
01:37:33.305,01:37:35.599,"Luce, you gotta stop. Hey, you know, fellas..."
01:37:36.517,01:37:37.643,"Sorry, hey..."
01:37:37.726,01:37:40.938,Can I just have a moment... Can I just have a moment with my wife?
01:37:44.942,01:37:46.193,You got one minute.
01:37:46.277,01:37:47.903,All right. Luce?
01:37:49.530,01:37:50.948,"Baby, baby, listen to me."
01:37:57.162,01:37:58.622,I'm gonna go to prison.
01:37:58.831,01:38:01.792,I'm gonna do just... Just a little time.
01:38:02.459,01:38:04.336,And I'm gonna be fine there.
01:38:05.838,01:38:10.467,"And we're gonna work everything out, but I gotta know you're gonna be safe."
01:38:15.514,01:38:17.474,It's gonna be all right.
01:38:19.351,01:38:20.769,You gotta trust me.
01:38:20.853,01:38:22.813,"I mean, you trust me, right?"
01:38:22.896,01:38:23.939,Fuck no!
01:38:26.859,01:38:28.193,All right.
01:38:51.842,01:38:53.093,is being protected by our side?
01:38:57.556,01:38:59.433,...that any such sting operation was underway.
01:39:03.646,01:39:07.107,"You are sentenced to 1,000 hours community service."
01:39:11.278,01:39:12.112,I'm sorry.
01:39:13.238,01:39:14.823,"-here of the highest order. -Uh, community service?"
01:39:14.907,01:39:15.991,Exhibit D!
01:39:19.119,01:39:20.537,...of this Mickey Mouse tap-dancin' bullshit.
