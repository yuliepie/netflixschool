00:01:50.208,00:01:51.959,Good morning.
00:01:53.333,00:01:54.917,"TOWN CRIER: Here ye, here ye!"
00:01:54.959,00:01:59.750,Ten minutes to go till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal!
00:02:01.500,00:02:02.792,Ah!
00:02:14.917,00:02:17.375,Oh! Watch it!
00:02:42.083,00:03:18.125,BOTH: BOTH: NELL: Blimey! It's my dress is caught.
00:03:18.166,00:03:20.000,"Begging your pardon, ma'am."
00:03:20.041,00:03:22.667,It's not me.
00:03:22.709,00:03:25.667,Where is Victor?
00:03:30.500,00:03:32.834,Fish merchants.
00:03:47.291,00:04:06.375,"BOTH: Oh, dear."
00:04:06.417,00:04:50.417,"BOTH: BOTH: BOTH: Oh, Hildegarde."
00:04:50.458,00:04:51.750,What if Victor and I don't...
00:04:52.792,00:04:53.750,...like each other?
00:04:55.291,00:04:58.000,As if that has anything to do with marriage.
00:04:58.041,00:05:01.750,Do you suppose your father and I like each other?
00:05:01.792,00:05:03.500,"Surely, you must...a little?"
00:05:03.542,00:05:05.583,BOTH: Of course not.
00:05:05.625,00:05:07.709,Get those corsets laced properly.
00:05:07.750,00:05:10.750,I can hear you speak without gasping.
00:05:17.000,00:05:19.458,"You've certainly hooked a winner this time, Victor."
00:05:19.500,00:05:21.709,"Now, all you have to do is reel her in."
00:05:21.750,00:05:23.375,"I'm already reeling, Mother."
00:05:23.417,00:05:25.458,Shouldn't Victoria Everglot be marrying a...
00:05:25.500,00:05:26.625,"lord, or something?"
00:05:26.667,00:05:28.000,"Oh, nonsense!"
00:05:28.041,00:05:30.166,We're every bit as good as the Everglots.
00:05:30.208,00:05:34.709,I always knew I deserved better than a fish merchant's life.
00:05:34.750,00:05:37.125,But...I've never even spoken to her.
00:05:37.166,00:05:39.625,"Well, at least we have that in our favor."
00:05:40.959,00:05:44.125,Mayhew! Silence that blasted coughing.
00:05:49.417,00:05:53.125,"Marriage is a partnership, a little tit for tat."
00:05:53.166,00:05:56.083,You'd think a lifetime watching us...
00:06:05.250,00:06:20.709,PARENTS: Look at the way you're standing.
00:06:20.750,00:06:23.083,You look like you got rickets or something.
00:06:23.125,00:06:24.208,What the--? Oh.
00:06:29.333,00:06:30.583,Oh!
00:06:31.750,00:06:33.709,"Oh, my goodness."
00:06:33.750,00:06:36.458,"Oh, such grandeur!"
00:06:37.542,00:06:39.000,"Oh, beautiful, innit?"
00:06:39.041,00:06:40.333,Hmph!
00:06:41.583,00:06:43.333,"It's not as big as our place, dear."
00:06:45.917,00:06:47.875,"Mm. A little bit shabby, really, isn't it?"
00:06:47.917,00:06:49.208,Shut up.
00:06:49.250,00:06:55.959,"EMIL: Lord and Lady Everglot, Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort."
00:06:56.000,00:06:58.625,"Why, you must be Miss Victoria."
00:06:58.667,00:07:02.000,"Oh, yes, I must say, you don't look a day over 20."
00:07:02.041,00:07:04.333,"No. Oh, yes."
00:07:04.375,00:07:07.041,"Smile, darling, smile."
00:07:11.667,00:07:13.375,"Well, hello."
00:07:13.417,00:07:16.375,What a pleasure.
00:07:16.417,00:07:18.834,Oh-ho-ho!
00:07:18.875,00:07:21.583,We'll be taking tea in the west drawing room.
00:07:23.083,00:07:24.792,"Oh, do come this way."
00:07:24.834,00:07:26.208,It's just through there.
00:07:26.250,00:07:28.083,"Oh, I love what you've done with the place."
00:07:28.125,00:07:30.166,Who is your decorator?
00:07:30.208,00:07:32.375,WILLIAM: Nice tiles.
00:07:32.417,00:07:35.208,"NELL: Oh, my husband says such foolish things."
00:07:35.250,00:07:36.667,Ignore him.
00:07:36.709,00:07:38.458,"WILLIAM: Oh, yes, it's usually best."
00:09:03.709,00:09:05.458,Oh! Oh!
00:09:06.792,00:09:08.291,Do forgive me.
00:09:08.333,00:09:10.625,You play beautifully.
00:09:10.667,00:09:13.083,"I-- I-- I do apologize, Miss Everglot."
00:09:13.125,00:09:16.625,How rude of me to-- Well...
00:09:16.667,00:09:18.041,Excuse me.
00:09:19.959,00:09:22.000,Mother won't let me near the piano.
00:09:23.208,00:09:26.041,Music is improper for a young lady.
00:09:26.083,00:09:27.750,"Too passionate, she says."
00:09:27.792,00:09:35.208,"If I may ask, M-Miss...Everglot, where is your ch-chaperon?"
00:09:35.250,00:09:43.667,"Perhaps, in-- In view of the circumstances, you could call me Victoria."
00:09:43.709,00:09:46.166,"Heh. Yes, of course."
00:09:46.208,00:09:47.500,Victoria...
00:09:47.542,00:09:49.709,Yes...Victor?
00:09:49.750,00:09:57.750,"T-- Tomorrow, we are to be...m-- M-- Mmm-- Married."
00:09:57.792,00:10:00.041,Yes. Ha.
00:10:00.083,00:10:01.166,M-m-married.
00:10:02.458,00:10:05.917,"Since I was a child, I've-- I've dreamt of my wedding day."
00:10:07.291,00:10:10.250,I always hoped to find someone I was deeply in love with.
00:10:10.291,00:10:13.917,Someone to spend the rest of my life with.
00:10:13.959,00:10:15.417,"Silly, isn't it?"
00:10:15.458,00:10:17.291,"Yes, silly. Ha."
00:10:17.333,00:10:18.417,No!
00:10:18.458,00:10:19.875,"No, not at all, no."
00:10:19.917,00:10:20.875,Oh!
00:10:20.917,00:10:23.792,"Oh! Oh, dear. I'm sorry."
00:10:29.375,00:10:32.166,What impropriety is this?
00:10:32.208,00:10:34.333,You shouldn't be alone together.
00:10:34.375,00:10:39.041,"Here it is, one minute before 5, and you're not at the rehearsal."
00:10:39.083,00:10:42.083,Pastor Galswells is waiting.
00:10:42.125,00:10:44.250,Come at once.
00:10:44.291,00:10:47.250,"GALSWELLS: Master Van Dort, from the beginning."
00:10:47.291,00:10:48.667,Again.
00:10:49.834,00:10:54.917,"With this hand, I will lift your sorrows."
00:10:54.959,00:11:00.875,"Your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine."
00:11:00.917,00:11:07.083,"With this candle, I will light your way in darkness."
00:11:07.125,00:11:12.834,"With this ring, I ask you to be mine."
00:11:13.750,00:11:15.583,Let's try it again.
00:11:15.625,00:11:16.959,"Yes. Yes, sir."
00:11:17.000,00:11:19.417,With this candle...
00:11:21.834,00:11:23.667,This candle...
00:11:25.125,00:11:27.875,This candle.
00:11:27.917,00:11:30.041,NELL: Shall I get up there and do it for him?
00:11:30.083,00:11:31.542,"Don't get all aflutter, dear."
00:11:37.375,00:11:39.375,With this candle...
00:11:41.041,00:11:42.750,Oh!
00:11:44.709,00:11:48.333,"Get the door, Emil."
00:11:48.375,00:11:51.417,Let's just pick it up at the candle bit.
00:11:53.375,00:11:55.291,"A Lord Barkis, sir."
00:11:59.542,00:12:02.000,I haven't a head for dates.
00:12:02.041,00:12:05.166,"Apparently, I'm a day early for the ceremony."
00:12:06.208,00:12:08.834,Is he from your side of the family?
00:12:08.875,00:12:10.458,I can't recall.
00:12:10.500,00:12:13.375,"Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis."
00:12:18.208,00:12:20.291,Do carry on.
00:12:21.041,00:12:26.041,"Let's try it again, shall we, Master Van Dort?"
00:12:26.083,00:12:29.125,"Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly."
00:12:29.166,00:12:30.458,Right.
00:12:30.500,00:12:34.291,Right. Oh! Right!
00:12:34.333,00:12:37.875,With this... This-- Hand!
00:12:37.917,00:12:43.542,"With this hand, I-- With-- Ooh!"
00:12:43.583,00:12:45.041,"Three steps, three!"
00:12:45.083,00:12:46.500,Can you not count?
00:12:46.542,00:12:49.667,"Do you not wish to be married, Master Van Dort?"
00:12:49.709,00:12:51.542,No! No.
00:12:51.583,00:12:55.750,"No! I meant, no, I do not not wish to be married."
00:12:55.792,00:12:58.250,"That is, I want very much to-- Ow!"
00:12:58.291,00:12:59.709,Pay attention!
00:12:59.750,00:13:02.750,Have you even remembered to bring the ring?
00:13:02.792,00:13:04.959,The ring?
00:13:08.959,00:13:10.166,Dropping the ring.
00:13:10.208,00:13:11.875,"MAUDELINE: Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!"
00:13:11.917,00:13:13.709,This boy doesn't want to get married.
00:13:13.750,00:13:15.250,How disgraceful!
00:13:15.291,00:13:17.291,Excuse me. Got it!
00:13:20.291,00:13:23.208,"Out of the way, you ninny."
00:13:23.250,00:13:25.000,"WILLIAM: Oh, dear! Oh, my!"
00:13:25.041,00:13:28.709,"Giddy on, there's a woman on fire! Help! Emergency!"
00:13:28.750,00:13:31.417,"Oh, my-- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain."
00:13:31.458,00:13:34.583,"Stop fanning it, you fool."
00:13:38.000,00:13:39.625,"Get a bucket, get a bucket."
00:13:39.667,00:13:42.583,"I'm on my way, dear."
00:13:50.625,00:13:52.250,Enough!
00:13:52.291,00:13:56.500,This wedding cannot take place until he is properly prepared.
00:13:58.166,00:14:00.291,Young man...
00:14:00.333,00:14:04.041,learn your vows.
00:14:17.959,00:14:22.875,"Well...he's quite the catch, isn't he?"
00:14:36.959,00:14:39.208,"Oh, Victoria."
00:14:39.250,00:14:43.333,She must think I'm such a fool.
00:14:43.375,00:14:45.458,"Hear ye, hear ye!"
00:14:45.500,00:14:49.583,Rehearsal in ruins as Van Dort boy causes chaos!
00:14:50.542,00:14:54.667,Fishy fiancé could be canned!
00:14:54.709,00:15:00.375,Everglots all fired up as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!
00:15:01.917,00:15:04.625,It really shouldn't be all that difficult.
00:15:04.667,00:15:06.959,It's just a few simple vows.
00:15:07.000,00:15:09.041,With this hand...
00:15:09.083,00:15:10.709,I will take your wine.
00:15:10.750,00:15:12.625,Oh! No.
00:15:13.917,00:15:15.125,With this hand...
00:15:16.208,00:15:19.333,"...I will cup your-- Oh, goodness, no."
00:15:20.917,00:15:23.667,With...this...
00:15:23.709,00:15:25.375,With this...
00:15:25.417,00:15:28.000,"With this candle, I will..."
00:15:29.750,00:15:31.458,I will...
00:15:31.500,00:15:34.125,I will set your mother on fire.
00:15:36.041,00:15:37.750,"Oh, it's no use."
00:15:50.333,00:15:55.083,"With this hand, I will lift your sorrows."
00:15:55.125,00:15:59.792,"Your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine."
00:16:01.417,00:16:02.875,"Ah, Mrs. Everglot."
00:16:02.917,00:16:06.417,You look ravishing this evening.
00:16:06.458,00:16:08.417,"What's that, Mr. Everglot?"
00:16:08.458,00:16:11.667,Call you Dad?
00:16:11.709,00:16:16.333,"With this candle, I will light your way in darkness."
00:16:16.375,00:16:21.667,"With this ring, I ask you to be mine."
00:16:48.000,00:16:49.583,Oh! Umph!
00:17:16.166,00:17:17.500,I do.
00:17:41.250,00:17:42.333,Ooh!
00:18:46.000,00:18:48.959,You may kiss the bride.
00:18:56.000,00:18:59.375,A new arrival.
00:18:59.417,00:19:02.333,Are you all right?
00:19:02.375,00:19:05.750,"By Jove, man. Looks like we've got ourselves a breather."
00:19:05.792,00:19:07.333,Does he have a dead brother?
00:19:07.375,00:19:08.875,He's still soft.
00:19:10.417,00:19:11.750,Oh!
00:19:11.792,00:19:12.792,"A toast, then."
00:19:19.125,00:19:20.792,To the newlyweds.
00:19:20.834,00:19:22.250,Newlyweds?
00:19:22.291,00:19:26.792,"Oh, in the woods, you said your vows so perfectly."
00:19:26.834,00:19:28.041,I did?
00:19:29.417,00:19:30.458,I did.
00:19:30.500,00:19:33.291,Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
00:19:33.333,00:19:34.959,PAUL: Bonjour!
00:19:35.000,00:19:38.125,"Coming through, coming through."
00:19:38.166,00:19:41.000,My name is Paul.
00:19:42.417,00:19:44.709,I will be creating your wedding feast.
00:19:45.667,00:19:47.917,Wedding feast!
00:19:48.959,00:19:50.125,"Maggots. Ha, ha, ha."
00:19:50.166,00:19:51.125,Oh!
00:19:51.166,00:19:52.291,Hey!
00:19:52.333,00:19:53.917,Keep away!
00:19:59.542,00:20:03.291,Unh! I've got a-- I've got a...dwarf.
00:20:03.333,00:20:07.333,And I'm not afraid to use him.
00:20:07.375,00:20:09.583,Answers. I think you mean answers.
00:20:09.625,00:20:11.959,"Thank you, yes, answers."
00:20:12.000,00:20:14.667,What's going on here?
00:20:14.709,00:20:16.000,Who are you?
00:20:16.041,00:20:19.750,Well...that's kind of a long story.
00:20:19.792,00:20:22.250,What a story it is.
00:20:22.291,00:20:27.959,"A tragic tale of romance, passion and murder most foul."
00:20:28.000,00:20:29.291,This is gonna be good.
00:20:29.333,00:20:30.333,Oh!
00:20:31.709,00:20:33.375,"Hit it, boys."
00:20:57.333,00:21:12.125,"SKELETONES: Ha, ha, ha, ha."
00:21:32.458,00:22:01.417,SKELETONES: BONEJANGLES: Oh!
00:22:01.458,00:22:02.959,That's right.
00:22:03.000,00:22:05.083,Uh-huh. Okay.
00:22:05.125,00:22:08.000,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:08.041,00:22:11.250,Yeah. Like it.
00:22:11.291,00:22:13.166,"Okay, Chancy, take it."
00:22:15.417,00:22:17.458,BONEJANGLES: Yeah. Whoo!
00:22:17.500,00:22:19.417,"Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yes, yes!"
00:22:19.458,00:22:21.709,"Yah! Hee, hee, hee!"
00:22:21.750,00:22:23.458,"Hee, hee, hee, hee, yeah!"
00:22:23.500,00:22:26.291,Hah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Yah!
00:22:26.333,00:22:27.875,BONEJANGLES: Yeah!
00:22:31.834,00:22:33.709,BONEJANGLES: That's nice.
00:23:11.250,00:23:56.417,BONEJANGLES: SKELETONES: Yeah.
00:24:08.083,00:24:10.750,"MAUDELINE: Victoria, come away from the window."
00:24:12.000,00:24:14.166,"Oh, I'm sure he'll be back shortly."
00:24:14.208,00:24:16.166,He's terrified of the dark.
00:24:16.208,00:24:20.750,"In fact, when he was a boy, he used to wet his combinations regularly, didn't he, William?"
00:24:21.875,00:24:23.166,Enter.
00:24:26.041,00:24:28.625,"Ah, Lord Barkis."
00:24:28.667,00:24:31.166,I trust the room is to your liking.
00:24:31.208,00:24:34.917,"Thank you, you are a most gracious hostess."
00:24:34.959,00:24:39.542,Which is why it pains me to be the bearer of...
00:24:39.583,00:24:41.208,such bad news.
00:24:45.250,00:24:49.000,Would you care to repeat tonight's headline for us?
00:24:49.041,00:24:51.125,"Hear ye, hear ye!"
00:24:51.166,00:24:55.959,Victor Van Dort seen this night on the bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!
00:24:56.000,00:25:01.000,The dark-haired temptress and Master Van Dort slipped away into the night!
00:25:01.041,00:25:03.125,"And now, the weather."
00:25:01.041,00:25:05.250,Scattered showers-- Enough!
00:25:08.083,00:25:09.375,Mystery woman?
00:25:09.417,00:25:11.750,He doesn't even know any women!
00:25:11.792,00:25:13.375,Or so you thought.
00:25:14.667,00:25:17.250,Do call for me if you need my assistance...
00:25:18.500,00:25:20.333,in any way.
00:25:22.500,00:25:24.917,"Good heavens, Finis, what should we do?"
00:25:24.959,00:25:26.625,Fetch me musket.
00:25:26.667,00:25:28.166,"Oh, William, do something."
00:25:28.208,00:25:30.917,"Um, the town crier probably just had a slow news day."
00:25:30.959,00:25:32.208,You know how it is.
00:25:32.250,00:25:33.625,You need a little something to cry about.
00:25:33.667,00:25:38.500,"Regardless, we are one groom short for the wedding tomorrow."
00:25:38.542,00:25:41.834,Not to mention the financial implications.
00:25:41.875,00:25:44.834,A most scandalous embarrassment for us all.
00:25:44.875,00:25:48.458,"Oh, give us a chance to find him, we beg of you."
00:25:48.500,00:25:50.250,Just give us until dawn.
00:25:50.291,00:25:53.000,Very well. Till dawn.
00:25:53.041,00:25:56.875,"Victor, darling, where are you?"
00:25:56.917,00:26:00.709,"MAGGOT: If you ask me, your boyfriend is kind of jumpy."
00:26:00.750,00:26:03.208,He's not my boyfriend.
00:26:03.250,00:26:06.000,"Victor, where have you gone?"
00:26:06.041,00:26:07.959,I'll keep an eye out for him.
00:26:08.000,00:26:09.417,CORPSE BRIDE: Victor?
00:26:13.542,00:26:15.500,"There he goes, there he goes!"
00:26:15.542,00:26:16.667,He's-- He's getting away!
00:26:16.709,00:26:18.875,"Quick, quick, after him!"
00:26:18.917,00:26:20.291,Victor.
00:26:25.709,00:26:26.875,Thank you.
00:26:26.917,00:26:30.375,Victor!
00:26:33.083,00:26:35.250,Victor?
00:26:35.291,00:26:37.834,Where have you gone?
00:26:37.875,00:26:40.542,"Married, huh? I'm a widow."
00:26:40.583,00:26:43.542,"Oh, how rude. He went that way!"
00:26:45.083,00:26:46.875,CORPSE BRIDE: Victor.
00:26:48.083,00:26:49.917,"Victor, darling."
00:26:51.417,00:26:54.250,Please. There's been a mistake.
00:26:56.125,00:26:57.166,Oh!
00:26:58.792,00:26:59.959,Excuse me.
00:27:00.500,00:27:01.583,Excuse me.
00:27:02.792,00:27:03.792,Excuse me.Excuse me.
00:27:04.625,00:27:06.500,Thank you.
00:27:06.542,00:27:07.959,CORPSE BRIDE: Victor.
00:27:09.917,00:27:11.250,Dead end.
00:27:11.291,00:27:14.709,Victor!
00:27:23.500,00:27:24.917,"Could have used the stairs, silly."
00:27:24.959,00:27:27.000,Oh!
00:27:28.291,00:27:32.458,Isn't the view beautiful?
00:27:33.792,00:27:36.041,"Well, it would if I had any."
00:27:37.667,00:27:39.917,Isn't it romantic?
00:27:47.333,00:27:54.125,"Look, I am terribly sorry about what's happened to you, and I'd like to help, but I really need to get home."
00:27:54.166,00:27:55.583,This is your home now.
00:27:55.625,00:27:57.500,But I don't even know your name.
00:27:57.542,00:28:00.959,"MAGGOT: Well, that's a great way to start a marriage."
00:28:01.000,00:28:02.458,Shh. Shut up!
00:28:04.583,00:28:07.500,It's Emily.
00:28:07.542,00:28:11.792,"Oh, I almost forgot."
00:28:11.834,00:28:14.542,It's a wedding present.
00:28:27.458,00:28:28.792,Thank you.
00:28:50.750,00:28:52.166,Scraps?
00:28:54.417,00:28:55.458,Scraps!
00:28:55.500,00:28:57.542,"My dog, Scraps!"
00:29:00.542,00:29:03.625,"Oh, Scraps, what a good boy."
00:29:03.667,00:29:05.875,EMILY: I knew you'd be happy to see him.
00:29:05.917,00:29:09.125,Who's my good boy?
00:29:10.583,00:29:13.709,"Good boy, Scraps."
00:29:13.750,00:29:16.834,"Good boy, Scraps."
00:29:18.417,00:29:19.375,Sorry.
00:29:20.583,00:29:22.041,"Oh, what a cutie."
00:29:22.083,00:29:23.333,You should have seen him with fur.
00:29:24.917,00:29:28.000,Mother never approved of Scraps jumping up like this.
00:29:28.041,00:29:31.542,"But then again, she never approved of anything."
00:29:31.583,00:29:33.834,Do you think she would have approved of me?
00:29:33.875,00:29:37.166,Heh. You're lucky you'll never have to meet her.
00:29:39.458,00:29:40.834,"Well, actually..."
00:29:42.166,00:29:45.291,"now that you mention it, I think you should."
00:29:45.333,00:29:46.291,Hm.
00:29:46.333,00:29:48.041,In fact...
00:29:48.083,00:29:49.291,"since we're, you know..."
00:29:50.208,00:29:53.083,"married, you should definitely meet her."
00:29:53.125,00:29:54.625,Mm-hmm.
00:29:54.667,00:29:56.208,We should go and see them right now.
00:29:56.250,00:29:59.083,"Oh, what a fantastic idea!"
00:29:59.125,00:30:00.709,Oh.
00:30:00.750,00:30:01.917,What? What is it?
00:30:01.959,00:30:04.208,They're not from around here.
00:30:04.250,00:30:06.667,Where are they?
00:30:06.709,00:30:08.542,"Oh, they're still alive."
00:30:08.583,00:30:10.834,I'm afraid so.
00:30:10.875,00:30:12.375,"What's that, Scraps?"
00:30:13.542,00:30:15.667,"Oh, no, we couldn't possibly."
00:30:17.458,00:30:20.000,"Oh, well, if you put it like that."
00:30:20.041,00:30:21.375,What?
00:30:21.417,00:30:23.291,Elder Gutknecht.
00:30:31.000,00:30:33.166,Shh! Scraps.
00:30:33.750,00:30:36.458,Elder Gutknecht?
00:30:36.500,00:30:38.125,Are you there?
00:30:40.917,00:30:44.792,Hello? Is anyone home?
00:30:44.834,00:30:46.291,Hello?
00:30:57.667,00:31:00.000,EMILY: There you are!
00:31:00.041,00:31:02.625,"Huh? Oh, my dear."
00:31:02.667,00:31:05.166,"I've brought my husband, Victor."
00:31:05.208,00:31:08.250,What's that? Husband?
00:31:08.291,00:31:10.333,"Pleasure to meet you, sir."
00:31:11.583,00:31:14.041,We need to go up.
00:31:14.083,00:31:15.458,To visit the land of the living.
00:31:15.500,00:31:18.291,Land of the living?
00:31:21.125,00:31:22.917,"Oh, my dear."
00:31:22.959,00:31:24.417,"Please, Elder Gutknecht."
00:31:24.458,00:31:28.417,"Now, why go up there, when people are dying to get down here?"
00:31:28.458,00:31:29.792,"Sir, I beg you to help."
00:31:29.834,00:31:33.625,It means so much to me-- Us.
00:31:33.667,00:31:35.166,I don't know.
00:31:35.208,00:31:36.875,It's just not natural.
00:31:36.917,00:31:38.959,"Please, Elder Gutknecht."
00:31:39.000,00:31:41.750,Surely there must be something you can do.
00:31:41.792,00:31:43.583,Hm...
00:31:43.625,00:31:46.542,Let me see what I can do.
00:31:46.583,00:31:49.542,Where did I put that book?
00:31:56.083,00:31:58.375,I left it here somewhere.
00:32:01.333,00:32:03.792,"Ah, there's the one."
00:32:11.417,00:32:12.583,Um...
00:32:16.959,00:32:18.458,I have it.
00:32:19.583,00:32:21.834,A Ukrainian haunting spell.
00:32:21.875,00:32:24.417,Just the thing for these quick trips.
00:32:24.458,00:32:27.667,So glad you thought of this.
00:32:27.709,00:32:28.792,Me too.
00:32:36.125,00:32:37.208,Ah.
00:32:52.250,00:32:53.875,"Now, then..."
00:32:55.083,00:32:56.333,...where were we?
00:32:57.458,00:32:59.417,The Ukrainian haunting spell?
00:32:59.458,00:33:00.500,Ah...
00:33:08.166,00:33:10.709,"Ah, here we have it."
00:33:10.750,00:33:11.792,Ready?
00:33:11.834,00:33:15.875,"Just remember, when you want to come back, say Hopscotch."
00:33:15.917,00:33:16.959,Hopscotch?
00:33:17.000,00:33:18.667,That's it.
00:33:28.625,00:33:29.834,Oh!
00:33:35.166,00:33:41.542,"I spent so long in the darkness, I'd almost forgotten how beautiful the moonlight is."
00:34:09.583,00:34:11.959,"Psst. Hey, I think you dropped something."
00:34:30.917,00:34:32.542,"Hold on, hold on."
00:34:34.542,00:34:38.875,I think I should prepare Mother and Father for the big news.
00:34:40.500,00:34:42.709,"I'll go ahead, and you..."
00:34:42.750,00:34:45.000,wait here.
00:34:45.041,00:34:46.792,Perfect.
00:34:46.834,00:34:48.875,I won't be long.
00:34:48.917,00:34:51.041,Stay right here.
00:34:51.083,00:34:52.041,I'll be right back.
00:34:52.083,00:34:53.208,Okay.
00:34:54.333,00:34:55.542,No peeking.
00:35:15.500,00:35:21.792,"FINIS: If ever I see that Van Dort boy, I'll strangle him with my bare hands."
00:35:21.834,00:35:26.166,"Your hands are too fat, and his neck is too thin."
00:35:26.208,00:35:27.750,You'll have to use a rope.
00:35:39.000,00:35:41.458,MAGGOT: This is the voice of your conscience.
00:35:41.500,00:35:43.417,Listen to what I say.
00:35:43.458,00:35:46.166,I have a bad feeling about that boy.
00:35:46.208,00:35:52.166,You know he is no-- Go chew someone else's ear for a while.
00:35:52.208,00:35:56.125,"Victor has gone to see his parents, just like he said."
00:35:56.166,00:36:00.625,"If I hadn't just been sitting in it, I would say that you had lost your mind!"
00:36:00.667,00:36:03.250,I'm sure he has a perfectly good reason...
00:36:03.291,00:36:05.250,for taking so long.
00:36:05.291,00:36:08.625,Oh. I am sure he does.
00:36:08.667,00:36:10.542,"All right, I will."
00:36:08.667,00:36:14.458,"After all, he couldn't get far with those cold feet."
00:36:53.125,00:36:54.250,Victoria.
00:36:54.291,00:36:57.000,Victor?
00:36:57.041,00:36:58.542,Come by the fire.
00:36:58.583,00:37:01.166,Where have you been?
00:37:01.208,00:37:05.625,"I-- I-- Oh, dear."
00:37:05.667,00:37:09.208,You're as cold as death.
00:37:09.250,00:37:10.333,Your coat.
00:37:12.125,00:37:14.166,Victoria...
00:37:14.208,00:37:16.250,I confess.
00:37:16.291,00:37:19.500,This morning I was...
00:37:20.917,00:37:29.917,"But then, on meeting you, I felt...I should be with you always, and that our wedding..."
00:37:30.458,00:37:32.333,Oh!
00:37:32.375,00:37:36.208,"Victor, I feel the same."
00:37:39.041,00:37:40.041,Aaah!
00:37:41.083,00:37:46.542,"Victoria, I se-- I se-- I seem to find myself married."
00:37:46.583,00:37:49.125,And you should know it's unexpected. Oh!
00:37:53.750,00:37:59.583,"My darling, I just wanted to meet-- Darling?"
00:37:59.625,00:38:01.917,Who's this?
00:38:01.959,00:38:04.333,I'm his wife.
00:38:05.625,00:38:07.000,Victor?
00:38:07.041,00:38:08.709,"Victoria, wait."
00:38:08.750,00:38:11.291,She's dead. Look.
00:38:14.959,00:38:16.250,Hopscotch.
00:38:17.625,00:38:18.625,Oh!
00:38:19.291,00:38:21.917,No! No! Victoria!
00:38:26.792,00:38:28.875,You lied to me!
00:38:28.917,00:38:31.542,Just to get back to that other woman.
00:38:31.583,00:38:34.583,Don't you understand?
00:38:34.625,00:38:37.000,No! You're married to me.
00:38:37.041,00:38:39.333,She's the other woman.
00:38:42.834,00:38:43.959,She's got a point.
00:38:45.291,00:38:46.917,And I thought...
00:38:46.959,00:38:50.208,I thought this was all going so well.
00:38:59.291,00:39:02.583,"Look, I'm sorry, but..."
00:39:02.625,00:39:04.250,this just can't work.
00:39:04.291,00:39:06.208,Why not?
00:39:07.166,00:39:09.500,"It's my eye, isn't it?"
00:39:09.542,00:39:11.458,No. Your eye is...
00:39:12.542,00:39:13.917,...lovely.
00:39:13.959,00:39:19.375,"Listen, under different circumstances, well, who knows?"
00:39:19.417,00:39:22.000,But we're just too different.
00:39:22.041,00:39:23.959,"I mean, you're dead."
00:39:24.000,00:39:26.750,You should've thought of that before you asked me to marry you.
00:39:26.792,00:39:29.166,Why can't you understand?
00:39:29.208,00:39:30.291,I would never marry you.
00:40:01.083,00:40:03.792,Roses for eternal love.
00:40:04.875,00:40:07.208,Lilies for sweetness.
00:40:10.083,00:40:11.709,Baby's breath.
00:40:17.417,00:40:19.166,Why so blue?
00:40:19.208,00:40:22.375,Maybe he's right.
00:40:22.417,00:40:24.959,MAGGOT: Maybe he should have his head examined.
00:40:25.375,00:40:26.542,Oh!
00:40:26.583,00:40:28.500,I could do it.
00:40:28.542,00:40:30.333,Or perhaps he does belong with her.
00:40:30.375,00:40:32.208,Little Miss Living.
00:40:32.250,00:40:36.041,With her rosy cheeks and beating heart.
00:40:36.083,00:40:40.375,"Oh, those girls are ten a penny."
00:40:40.417,00:40:45.583,You've got-- You've got-- You've got a wonderful personality.
00:41:00.917,00:41:02.166,How about a pulse?
00:41:02.208,00:43:22.333,"MAGGOT: BOTH: BOTH: BOTH: BOTH: BOTH: VICTORIA: It's true, Mother!"
00:43:22.375,00:43:25.250,Victor is married to a dead woman.
00:43:25.291,00:43:30.208,I saw her. A corpse!
00:43:30.250,00:43:31.875,Victor was in your room?
00:43:31.917,00:43:33.500,I have to help him.
00:43:33.542,00:43:35.208,The scandal!
00:43:35.250,00:43:37.375,"Oh, come sit in your chair, dearie."
00:43:37.417,00:43:39.250,You're shaking like a leaf.
00:43:39.291,00:43:41.417,Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.
00:43:41.458,00:43:43.083,Fetch her a straitjacket!
00:43:43.125,00:43:44.917,She's completely mad!
00:43:44.959,00:43:46.750,"Come, Hildegarde."
00:44:15.000,00:44:16.667,Ooh! Unh!
00:44:16.709,00:44:17.917,Oh!
00:44:18.959,00:44:20.166,Ooh!
00:44:20.208,00:44:23.208,"MAUDELINE: Finis, come to bed at once."
00:44:28.625,00:44:29.792,Oh!
00:44:43.834,00:44:46.917,What in heaven's name?
00:44:49.333,00:44:52.333,Who could that be at this hour?
00:44:53.875,00:44:55.250,Miss Everglot.
00:44:55.291,00:44:57.333,What are you doing here?
00:44:57.375,00:45:00.000,"You should be at home, prostrate with grief."
00:45:00.041,00:45:02.917,"Pastor Galswells, I have to ask you something."
00:45:02.959,00:45:04.500,This is most irregular.
00:45:04.542,00:45:06.500,"Please, I beg of you."
00:45:06.542,00:45:11.000,You are the only one in the village who knows of what awaits beyond the grave.
00:45:11.041,00:45:14.000,A grim topic for a bride-to-be.
00:45:14.041,00:45:21.125,"It is a bride I fear, which is why I must know: Can the living marry the dead?"
00:45:22.458,00:45:24.959,What on earth are you speaking about?
00:45:25.000,00:45:28.083,"Please, it's Victor."
00:45:28.125,00:45:30.750,He has a corpse bride!
00:45:30.792,00:45:34.625,There must be some way to undo what's been done.
00:45:35.208,00:45:36.834,Mmm.
00:45:36.875,00:45:40.041,I believe I know the thing to do.
00:45:40.083,00:45:41.959,Come with me.
00:45:44.417,00:45:46.041,MAUDELINE: Victoria?
00:45:46.083,00:45:47.500,Where are your corsets?
00:45:47.542,00:45:51.208,She's speaking in tongues.
00:45:51.250,00:45:53.667,"Her mind has come undone, I fear."
00:45:53.709,00:45:55.500,It's not true! Let me go!
00:45:55.542,00:45:56.667,Let me go!
00:45:56.709,00:45:58.166,"Thank you, Pastor Galswells."
00:45:58.208,00:46:00.166,Thank you so very much.
00:46:01.208,00:46:03.291,Take her to her room!
00:46:03.333,00:46:05.208,"No, I'm telling the truth."
00:46:05.250,00:46:07.250,Victor needs my help.
00:46:07.291,00:46:09.834,"Hildegarde, you believe me, don't you?"
00:46:09.875,00:46:12.375,"Mother, Father, please."
00:46:12.417,00:46:14.291,Seal the doors and bar the windows.
00:46:14.333,00:46:17.542,See to it that she doesn't escape again.
00:46:17.583,00:46:19.417,He needs our help!
00:46:19.458,00:46:21.959,"Oh, let me go!"
00:46:22.000,00:46:26.375,Will the mortification never cease?
00:46:26.417,00:46:29.542,It will be years before we can show ourselves in public again.
00:46:29.583,00:46:31.250,What shall we do?
00:46:31.291,00:46:34.750,"We shall continue as planned, with or without Vincent."
00:46:34.792,00:46:37.166,Victor.
00:46:37.208,00:46:42.083,For that boy to toss aside a young woman like Victoria...
00:46:42.125,00:46:44.250,it's positively criminal.
00:46:44.291,00:46:53.583,"Why, if I had a woman like your daughter on my arm, I would lavish her with riches befitting royalty."
00:46:53.625,00:46:57.250,Your lady wife is a most fortunate woman.
00:46:57.291,00:47:00.500,"Alas, I am not married."
00:47:00.542,00:47:06.625,"I was betrothed some years ago, but tragedy snatched my young bride away."
00:47:06.667,00:47:10.917,"When one lives alone, wealth counts for naught."
00:47:12.125,00:47:13.959,Oh...
00:47:16.750,00:47:17.959,Oh!
00:47:18.750,00:47:22.917,"Marvelous news, Victoria, there'll be a wedding after all."
00:47:22.959,00:47:24.375,You found him?
00:47:24.417,00:47:27.959,"Make haste, my dear, our relatives will arrive at any moment."
00:47:28.000,00:47:31.458,We must have you looking presentable for Lord Barkis.
00:47:33.500,00:47:34.917,Lord Barkis?
00:47:34.959,00:47:36.583,He will make a fine husband.
00:47:36.625,00:47:40.041,Aye. A fortuitous turn of events indeed.
00:47:40.083,00:47:42.542,A far better prospect this time.
00:47:42.583,00:47:46.417,But I do not love him.
00:47:46.458,00:47:47.625,We must.
00:47:47.667,00:47:49.417,"Please, I beg of you."
00:47:49.458,00:47:51.083,There must be another way.
00:47:51.125,00:47:55.792,"Without your marriage to Lord Barkis, we shall be forced, penniless, into the street."
00:47:55.834,00:47:57.458,We are destitute.
00:47:57.500,00:47:59.583,But Victor...
00:47:59.625,00:48:02.208,"Victor Van Dort has gone, child."
00:48:02.250,00:48:05.000,You shall marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.
00:48:08.041,00:48:10.250,BOTH: According to plan.
00:48:39.041,00:48:40.917,"Oh, my dear."
00:48:40.959,00:48:42.792,"Oh, don't look at me that way."
00:48:42.834,00:48:47.417,You have only to suffer this union until death do us part.
00:48:47.458,00:48:51.166,And that will come sooner than you think.
00:48:53.417,00:48:56.542,"NELL: Oh, it's almost dawn!"
00:48:56.583,00:48:59.750,Victor Van Dort elopes with corpse!
00:48:59.792,00:49:03.792,Heartbroken bride to wed wealthy newcomer!
00:49:03.834,00:49:06.583,Wealthy newcomer?
00:49:06.625,00:49:08.500,Did he say corpse?
00:49:08.542,00:49:10.000,"Oh, don't be ridiculous."
00:49:10.041,00:49:12.000,What corpse would marry our Victor?
00:49:13.250,00:49:15.041,"Oh, Mayhew!"
00:49:15.083,00:49:18.667,Silence that blasted coughing.
00:49:33.500,00:49:35.041,Ooh!
00:49:35.083,00:49:37.375,"NELL: Mayhew, are you trying to kill us?"
00:49:38.667,00:49:40.125,I think he's trying to kill us.
00:50:19.291,00:50:20.625,I...
00:50:21.834,00:50:23.625,think you dropped this.
00:50:32.792,00:50:34.500,I'm sorry.
00:50:34.542,00:50:38.542,I'm sorry I lied to you about wanting to see my parents.
00:50:38.583,00:50:42.750,It's just this whole day hasn't gone quite...well...
00:50:45.417,00:50:47.083,...according to plan.
00:51:52.583,00:51:54.417,Pardon my enthusiasm.
00:51:54.458,00:51:56.667,I like your enthusiasm.
00:52:01.333,00:52:04.000,New arrival!
00:52:04.041,00:52:05.583,Lights up!
00:52:08.250,00:52:10.291,"Hurry up, boys!"
00:52:10.333,00:52:12.834,Bonjour! Bienvenue!
00:52:12.875,00:52:15.291,Drinks for everyone.
00:52:15.333,00:52:17.208,"No, no. Just a half."
00:52:20.625,00:52:21.583,Oh!
00:52:23.083,00:52:25.709,It is impossible to get good help anymore.
00:52:25.750,00:52:28.500,"Welcoming committee, coming through! Coming through!"
00:52:28.542,00:52:32.250,My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
00:52:32.291,00:52:33.583,Mayhew?
00:52:34.792,00:52:37.458,Mayhew!
00:52:34.792,00:52:41.000,How nice to see you-- I'm so sorry.
00:52:41.041,00:52:45.250,"Oh, yeah. Actually, though, I feel great."
00:52:47.458,00:52:51.375,"Hurry up, boys. Can you not see the gentleman is parched?"
00:52:51.417,00:52:55.291,"VICTOR: Mayhew, I have to get back."
00:52:55.333,00:52:57.375,They all must be worried sick.
00:52:57.417,00:53:02.083,"Well, they're still wondering where you slipped off to."
00:53:02.125,00:53:04.458,"Oh, and, uh..."
00:53:04.500,00:53:06.250,"Yes? Yes, how is she?"
00:53:06.291,00:53:09.291,"Well, she's getting married this evening."
00:53:09.333,00:53:11.458,What?! Married to who?
00:53:11.500,00:53:15.291,"Some newcomer, Lord Somebody-or-Other."
00:53:15.333,00:53:16.792,But that's impossible!
00:53:16.834,00:53:19.250,"Yeah, with you gone and all..."
00:53:19.291,00:53:23.458,I guess they didn't wanna waste the cake. Heh.
00:53:23.500,00:53:25.834,But how could she?
00:53:25.875,00:53:28.875,"Women, you can't live with them."
00:53:29.792,00:53:31.333,You can't live with-- Hiccup!
00:53:32.875,00:53:38.083,"Time to pick up the pieces and, uh-- You know, and move on, I suppose."
00:53:38.125,00:53:39.333,SKELETON: Oi!
00:53:39.375,00:53:41.625,Speaking of picking up the pieces...
00:53:44.917,00:53:48.208,Victor?
00:53:51.375,00:53:56.542,"Miss Victoria, we must leave for the church now."
00:53:56.583,00:54:00.208,Yesterday I thought my wedding would be happy.
00:54:00.250,00:54:04.417,"Now I feel like I'm caught in the tide, pulled out to sea."
00:54:04.458,00:54:08.917,"The sea leads to many places, dearie."
00:54:08.959,00:54:12.500,Maybe you'll land somewhere better.
00:54:18.625,00:54:23.417,"With this candle, I will light your way in darkness."
00:54:28.834,00:54:34.709,"With this ring, I ask you to be mine."
00:54:38.458,00:54:42.458,I now pronounce you man and wife.
00:54:43.542,00:54:46.458,"Oh, oh, dear."
00:55:01.333,00:55:03.208,I'm too late.
00:55:07.458,00:55:10.083,"EMILY: Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?"
00:55:10.125,00:55:13.125,"He just walked off, without saying a word."
00:55:13.166,00:55:14.792,Are all men like this?
00:55:14.834,00:55:17.875,"Well, I'm afraid none of them are very bright."
00:55:17.917,00:55:22.500,"They get something stuck in their heads, and you can't do a thing with them."
00:55:23.542,00:55:25.834,"My dear, we have to talk."
00:55:25.875,00:55:27.000,MAGGOT: Let me tell her.
00:55:27.041,00:55:28.750,Please. Let me tell her.
00:55:28.792,00:55:30.667,What?
00:55:30.709,00:55:33.834,There is a complication with your marriage.
00:55:33.875,00:55:35.834,I don't understand.
00:55:35.875,00:55:40.500,The vows are binding only until death do you part.
00:55:40.542,00:55:42.166,What are you saying?
00:55:42.208,00:55:45.625,Death has already parted you.
00:55:46.834,00:55:48.667,"If he finds out, he'll leave."
00:55:48.709,00:55:50.834,There must be something you can do!
00:55:50.875,00:55:53.834,"Well, there is one way."
00:55:53.875,00:55:55.834,"Oh, please, please, let me tell her."
00:55:55.875,00:55:59.083,It requires the greatest sacrifice.
00:56:00.291,00:56:01.959,"Go on, get to the good part."
00:56:02.000,00:56:03.000,What is it?
00:56:03.041,00:56:05.041,We have to kill him!
00:56:05.083,00:56:06.041,What?
00:56:07.750,00:56:11.083,Victor would have to give up the life he had forever.
00:56:11.125,00:56:18.542,He would need to repeat his vows in the land of the living and drink from the wine of ages.
00:56:19.583,00:56:20.834,Poison!
00:56:20.875,00:56:24.041,This would stop his heart forever.
00:56:24.083,00:56:27.458,Only then would he be free to give it to you.
00:56:30.375,00:56:32.917,I could never ask him.
00:56:34.917,00:56:36.291,You don't have to.
00:56:39.625,00:56:41.166,I'll do it.
00:56:41.208,00:56:47.583,"My boy, if you choose this path, you may never return to the world above."
00:56:47.625,00:56:49.333,Do you understand?
00:56:52.625,00:56:54.834,I do.
00:56:54.875,00:56:57.959,Gather round.
00:57:01.125,00:57:04.083,We've decided to do this thing properly.
00:57:04.125,00:57:06.917,So grab what you can and follow us.
00:57:06.959,00:57:09.583,We're moving this wedding party upstairs.
00:57:09.625,00:57:12.417,Upstairs? I didn't know we had an upstairs.
00:57:12.458,00:57:13.917,Ooh!
00:57:13.959,00:57:15.291,Sounds creepy.
00:57:16.625,00:57:24.917,"ALL: Hold on, Victor."
00:57:24.959,00:57:26.500,You can't get married looking like that.
00:57:28.417,00:58:13.333,"SPIDERS: BOTH: Oh, my nose."
00:58:33.125,00:58:34.208,Hooray!
00:58:49.542,00:58:52.208,"Oh, there she is."
01:00:15.125,01:00:18.250,"Oh! Oh, dear."
01:00:29.792,01:00:32.667,"Quiet down now, everyone."
01:00:33.834,01:00:35.875,BARKIS: Mm-hmm.
01:00:37.166,01:00:38.625,Thank you.
01:00:39.667,01:00:44.750,"Elegant, cultured, radiant."
01:00:44.792,01:00:52.041,Victoria has found a husband with all these qualities and more.
01:00:52.083,01:00:59.375,"Serendipity brought us together, and no force on earth could tear us apart."
01:00:59.417,01:01:00.583,Oh!
01:01:00.625,01:01:02.166,Mm?
01:01:20.542,01:01:22.625,There's an eye in me soup.
01:01:30.375,01:01:31.500,Oooh!
01:01:31.542,01:01:32.500,Aaaah!
01:01:32.542,01:01:33.667,"Oh, sorry."
01:01:40.667,01:01:41.959,Fetch me musket!
01:01:42.000,01:01:44.208,Fetch your own musket.
01:01:44.250,01:01:45.375,Coming through.
01:01:45.417,01:01:46.667,Coming through.
01:01:48.542,01:01:49.709,Oh!
01:01:49.750,01:01:54.667,"Excuse me, you don't know me, but I used to live in your dead mother."
01:01:55.834,01:01:57.542,"Hey, hold on there."
01:01:57.583,01:02:00.417,I love a woman with meat on her bones.
01:02:00.458,01:02:01.458,Heh-heh-heh.
01:02:02.750,01:02:05.375,"Finis, who invited these people?"
01:02:05.417,01:02:08.500,They must be from your side of the family.
01:02:08.542,01:02:09.917,Certainly not.
01:02:09.959,01:02:13.875,"Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could see this, he'd be turning in his grave."
01:02:13.917,01:02:15.875,Finis.
01:02:17.375,01:02:19.875,Where do you keep the spirits?
01:02:28.458,01:02:29.709,In other news...
01:02:29.750,01:02:31.750,the dead walk the earth!
01:02:37.458,01:02:41.333,Get back! Don't try and sneak up on me!
01:02:41.375,01:02:42.625,Get back!
01:02:44.208,01:02:45.792,I'll give you such a wallop.
01:02:57.333,01:02:58.917,No.
01:02:58.959,01:03:00.500,SCISSORHEAD: Yeah.
01:03:14.792,01:03:16.000,Grandpa?
01:03:17.125,01:03:18.917,CROWD: Aww...
01:03:18.959,01:03:20.250,Huh?
01:03:20.291,01:03:21.792,Bounder!
01:03:21.834,01:03:23.542,Monster.
01:03:23.583,01:03:25.458,Cad!
01:03:25.500,01:03:27.417,Alfred?
01:03:28.041,01:03:29.125,Oh...
01:03:29.166,01:03:32.083,You've been dead for 15 years.
01:03:32.125,01:03:36.125,"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."
01:03:36.166,01:03:37.500,Ethel!
01:03:48.291,01:03:50.208,Right. That's it.
01:03:50.250,01:03:53.792,We're going to take whatever money we can and get out of here.
01:03:53.834,01:03:56.333,Money? What money?
01:03:56.375,01:03:58.875,Your dowry. It's my right!
01:03:58.917,01:04:01.000,But my parents don't have any money.
01:04:01.041,01:04:05.959,It's my marriage to you that will save them from the poorhouse.
01:04:06.000,01:04:08.166,The--? The poorhouse?!
01:04:08.208,01:04:10.709,You're lying!
01:04:10.750,01:04:12.375,Tell me that you're lying!
01:04:12.417,01:04:16.500,"Did things not go according to your plan, Lord Barkis?"
01:04:16.542,01:04:21.458,"Well, perhaps in disappointment we are perfectly matched."
01:04:40.166,01:04:43.041,"GALSWELLS: Be gone, ye demons from hell!"
01:04:43.083,01:04:47.333,Back to the void from whence you came!
01:04:47.375,01:04:49.250,You shall not enter here.
01:04:49.291,01:04:52.000,Back! Back!
01:04:52.041,01:04:53.917,"Keep it down, we're in a church."
01:04:53.959,01:04:55.458,Evenin'.
01:05:32.625,01:05:41.125,"Dearly beloved and departed, we are gathered here today to join this man and this corpse in marriage."
01:05:44.333,01:05:45.625,Victor?
01:05:45.667,01:05:46.917,Shh!
01:05:48.291,01:05:49.917,Living first.
01:05:51.875,01:05:53.583,With this hand...
01:05:54.291,01:05:56.834,I will lift your sorrows.
01:05:58.291,01:06:03.250,"Your cup will never empty, for I will be your wine."
01:06:03.291,01:06:05.417,Now you.
01:06:10.291,01:06:15.125,"With this hand, I will lift your sorrows."
01:06:16.291,01:06:20.208,Your cup will never empty.
01:06:21.417,01:06:23.250,For I will be...
01:06:28.834,01:06:30.667,I will be...
01:06:32.625,01:06:34.458,"Go on, my dear."
01:06:34.500,01:06:37.166,Your cup...
01:06:37.208,01:06:39.208,will never empty...
01:06:41.458,01:06:43.375,...for I will be...
01:06:45.500,01:06:48.041,I will be your wine.
01:06:52.333,01:06:54.083,She's having second thoughts.
01:06:56.875,01:06:58.458,I can't.
01:06:58.500,01:07:00.667,What's wrong?
01:07:02.041,01:07:03.709,This is wrong.
01:07:04.875,01:07:07.417,I was a bride.
01:07:07.458,01:07:10.834,My dreams were taken from me.
01:07:10.875,01:07:12.959,"Well, now..."
01:07:13.000,01:07:16.583,Now I've stolen them from someone else.
01:07:16.625,01:07:18.166,"I love you, Victor."
01:07:20.542,01:07:23.500,But you're not mine.
01:07:28.542,01:07:29.917,Victoria!
01:07:44.333,01:07:46.458,"BARKIS: Oh, how touching."
01:07:47.709,01:07:51.542,I always cry at weddings.
01:07:51.583,01:07:56.250,Our young lovers together at last.
01:07:56.291,01:08:00.583,Surely now they can live happily ever after.
01:08:01.291,01:08:03.083,But you forget...
01:08:03.125,01:08:05.250,she's still my wife!
01:08:05.291,01:08:08.417,I'll not leave here empty-handed!
01:08:09.291,01:08:10.917,You.
01:08:13.792,01:08:15.333,Emily?
01:08:15.375,01:08:16.709,You!
01:08:16.750,01:08:19.875,But-- But-- I left you.
01:08:19.917,01:08:22.083,For dead.
01:08:23.959,01:08:25.917,BARKIS: This woman is obviously delusional!
01:08:31.625,01:08:32.583,Aaah!
01:08:32.625,01:08:36.417,"Sorry to cut things short, but we must be on our way."
01:08:36.458,01:08:38.917,Take your hands off her.
01:08:39.792,01:08:42.458,Do I have to kill you too?
01:08:43.500,01:08:44.500,Argh!
01:08:46.500,01:08:48.208,"Victor, catch!"
01:08:49.667,01:08:51.125,Sorry.
01:09:00.083,01:09:01.542,Oooh!
01:09:01.583,01:09:03.834,"Ah, sacrebleu!"
01:09:05.583,01:09:07.542,"I say, you're not playing fair, sir."
01:09:16.000,01:09:16.959,Oop.
01:09:17.000,01:09:18.083,Rrrrah!
01:09:23.000,01:09:24.000,Ooh!
01:09:25.208,01:09:26.291,Oh!
01:09:27.291,01:09:28.875,Agh! Oh!
01:09:49.750,01:09:52.041,"Touché, my dear."
01:09:52.083,01:09:53.917,Get out.
01:09:53.959,01:09:56.625,"Oh, I'm leaving."
01:10:01.834,01:10:05.000,But first a toast.
01:10:05.041,01:10:09.542,"Always the bridesmaid, never the bride."
01:10:09.583,01:10:11.667,"Tell me, my dear..."
01:10:11.709,01:10:15.667,can a heart still break once it's stopped beating?
01:10:15.709,01:10:16.792,Hm?
01:10:18.834,01:10:20.375,Let me at him! Let me at him!
01:10:20.417,01:10:22.125,"No, don't hold me back."
01:10:23.250,01:10:26.000,We must abide by their rules.
01:10:26.041,01:10:29.375,We are amongst the living.
01:10:29.417,01:10:31.458,Well said.
01:10:36.625,01:10:37.667,Ah!
01:10:47.208,01:10:49.375,Not anymore.
01:10:52.750,01:10:55.792,"Yep, you're right."
01:11:06.750,01:11:08.458,New arrival.
01:11:15.458,01:11:19.458,"Oh, Victor, I never thought I'd see you again."
01:11:26.792,01:11:29.041,Wait.
01:11:29.083,01:11:31.709,I made a promise.
01:11:34.041,01:11:37.458,You kept your promise.
01:11:37.500,01:11:39.375,You set me free.
01:11:50.208,01:11:53.250,Now I can do the same for you.
01:12:28.250,01:12:29.208,Oh.
01:12:32.542,01:12:33.667,Oh!
