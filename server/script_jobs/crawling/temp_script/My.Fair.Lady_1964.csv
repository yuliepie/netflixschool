00:03:55.527,00:03:57.112,"Over here, sir, over here."
00:04:55.962,00:04:58.256,"Freddy, go and find a cab."
00:04:58.673,00:05:00.967,Do you want me to catch pneumonia?
00:05:12.354,00:05:15.232,"Don't just stand there, Freddy. Go and find a cab."
00:05:15.565,00:05:16.900,"All right, I'll get it. I'll get it."
00:05:33.667,00:05:36.878,"Look where you're going, dear. Look where you're going."
00:05:36.962,00:05:38.171,I'm so sorry.
00:05:38.588,00:05:42.467,Two bunches of violets trod in the mud. A full day's wages.
00:05:43.927,00:05:45.846,"Freddy, go and find a cab."
00:05:49.850,00:05:51.852,"Oh, he's your son, is he?"
00:05:51.935,00:05:58.066,"Well, if you'd done your duty by him as a mother should, you wouldn't let him spoil a poor girl's flowers and then run away without paying."
00:05:58.191,00:06:00.277,"Oh, go about your business, my girl."
00:06:00.360,00:06:02.696,And you wouldn't go off without paying either.
00:06:03.446,00:06:06.283,Two bunches of violets trod in the mud.
00:06:09.953,00:06:11.913,is there any sign of it stopping?
00:06:11.997,00:06:14.416,"-I'm afraid not. It's worse than before. -Oh, dear."
00:06:14.499,00:06:16.793,"If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over."
00:06:16.877,00:06:19.921,"Cheer up, captain. Buy a flower off a poor girl."
00:06:20.005,00:06:21.339,"I'm sorry, I haven't any change."
00:06:21.423,00:06:24.134,"Oh, I can change half a crown. Here, take this for two pence."
00:06:24.217,00:06:27.304,"I told you, I'm awfully sorry, I haven't-- Oh, wait a minute. Oh, yes."
00:06:27.554,00:06:29.472,"Here's three half pence, if that's any use to you."
00:06:30.056,00:06:31.099,"Thank you, sir."
00:06:39.274,00:06:41.318,"Here, you be careful. Better give him a flower for it."
00:06:41.735,00:06:45.864,There is a bloke here behind that pillar taking down every blessed word you're saying.
00:06:49.951,00:06:52.537,I ain't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman.
00:06:52.829,00:06:55.540,I've a right to sell flowers if I keep off the curb.
00:06:55.749,00:06:57.876,"I'm a respectable girl, so help me."
00:06:58.043,00:07:00.795,I never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me.
00:07:02.923,00:07:06.051,"-There's a tec taking her down. -Well, I'm making an honest living."
00:07:06.134,00:07:08.553,-Who's doing all that shouting? -Where is it coming from?
00:07:10.013,00:07:13.224,"Oh, sir, don't let him charge me. They don't know what it means to me."
00:07:13.308,00:07:19.356,"They'll take away me character and drive me on the streets -for speaking to gentlemen. -There, there, there, there."
00:07:19.439,00:07:21.900,"Who's hurting you, you silly girl? What do you take me for?"
00:07:21.983,00:07:24.486,"-On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word. -Oh, shut up, shut up."
00:07:24.569,00:07:25.654,Do I look like a policeman?
00:07:25.737,00:07:29.115,Then what did you take down my words for? How do I know you took me down right?
00:07:29.199,00:07:31.034,You just show me what you wrote about me.
00:07:34.496,00:07:35.372,Oh.
00:07:39.542,00:07:41.503,What's that? That ain't proper writing. I can't read it.
00:07:41.795,00:07:42.712,I can.
00:07:42.921,00:07:47.008,"I say, captain, now, buy a flower off a poor girl."
00:07:50.178,00:07:52.555,"Oh, it's 'cause I called him captain."
00:07:53.264,00:07:58.937,"I meant no harm. Oh, sir, don't let him lay a charge -against me for a word like that. -Charge? I'll make no charge."
00:07:59.229,00:08:05.026,"Really, sir, if you are a detective, you needn't begin protecting me against molestation from young women until I ask you."
00:08:05.110,00:08:07.612,Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.
00:08:07.737,00:08:10.782,He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman. Look at his boots.
00:08:10.907,00:08:12.867,How are all your people down at Selsey?
00:08:12.993,00:08:15.537,Who told you my people come from Selsey?
00:08:15.620,00:08:16.705,Never mind. They do.
00:08:17.831,00:08:21.751,How do you come to be up so far east? You were born in Lisson Grove.
00:08:22.627,00:08:26.095,"Oh, what 'arm is there my leaving Lisson Grove?"
00:08:26.270,00:08:31.344,It weren't fit for a pig to live in -and I had to pay four and six a week-- -Live where you like but stop that noise.
00:08:32.971,00:08:34.806,You've a right to live where you please.
00:08:34.931,00:08:37.100,"-I'm a good girl, I am. -Yes, yes, yes."
00:08:37.350,00:08:38.893,Where do I come from?
00:08:39.060,00:08:40.854,"-Hoxton. -Well, who said I didn't?"
00:08:40.937,00:08:42.731,"Blimey, you know everything, you do."
00:08:42.814,00:08:45.775,"You, sir, do you think you could find me a taxi?"
00:08:45.900,00:08:47.944,"I don't know whether you've noticed it, madam, but it's stopped raining."
00:08:48.028,00:08:50.321,You can get a motor bus to Hampton Court.
00:08:51.239,00:08:54.409,"-Well, that's where you live, isn't it? -What impertinence."
00:08:54.784,00:08:58.079,"Hey, tell him where he comes from. You wanna go fortune-telling?"
00:09:00.457,00:09:10.633,"Cheltenham, Harrow, Cambridge and uh… -India? -Quite right."
00:09:10.859,00:09:12.800,"Blimey, he ain't a tec, he's a blooming busybody."
00:09:12.950,00:09:16.472,"If I may ask, sir, do you do this sort of thing for a living at a music hall?"
00:09:16.550,00:09:18.475,"Well, I have thought of it. Perhaps, I will one day."
00:09:18.558,00:09:21.811,He's no gentleman. He ain't to interfere with a poor girl.
00:09:21.895,00:09:23.688,"How do you do it, may I ask?"
00:09:26.566,00:09:28.902,That's my profession. Also my hobby.
00:09:29.277,00:09:34.157,"Anyone can spot an Irishman or a Yorkshireman by his brogue, but I can place a man within six miles."
00:09:34.324,00:09:36.618,I can place him within two miles in London.
00:09:38.411,00:09:41.206,"Ought to be ashamed of himself, unmanly coward."
00:09:41.289,00:09:43.541,"-Is there a living in that? -Oh, yes, quite a fat one."
00:09:43.625,00:09:46.086,Let him mind his own business and leave a poor girl.
00:09:46.169,00:09:52.383,Woman! Cease this detestable boohooing instantly or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship.
00:09:53.384,00:09:56.304,"I have a right to be here if I like, same as you."
00:09:56.471,00:10:01.684,Woman who utters such disgusting and depressing noises has no right to be anywhere. No right to live.
00:10:01.976,00:10:06.439,Remember that you're a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech.
00:10:06.689,00:10:10.944,That your native language is the language of Shakespeare and Milton and the Bible.
00:10:11.027,00:10:14.197,Don't sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon.
00:10:14.322,00:10:15.907,Oh!
00:10:38.721,00:10:41.057,"Come, sir, I think you picked a poor example."
00:10:41.599,00:10:42.600,Did I?
00:11:10.461,00:11:11.838,Garn.
00:11:12.255,00:11:15.175,"I ask you, sir, what sort of word is that?"
00:12:21.741,00:12:53.940,"The French don't care what they do actually, Thank you."
00:12:54.774,00:12:56.943,You see this creature with her curbstone English?
00:12:57.026,00:12:59.362,The English that'll keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?
00:12:59.529,00:13:08.663,"Well, sir, in six months, I could pass her off which requires better English."
00:13:08.997,00:13:10.748,"Here, what's that you say?"
00:13:11.124,00:13:31.019,"Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf, you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns, you incarnate insult to the English language, Anything's possible. I myself am a student of Indian dialects."
00:13:31.519,00:13:32.437,Are you?
00:13:32.812,00:13:35.315,"Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of Spoken Sanskrit?"
00:13:36.566,00:13:38.943,I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?
00:13:39.110,00:13:42.071,"I'm Henry Higgins, author of Higgins Universal Alphabet."
00:13:42.196,00:13:44.741,I came from India to meet you.
00:13:44.866,00:13:46.659,I was going to India to meet you.
00:13:46.743,00:13:47.994,-Higgins. -Pickering.
00:13:50.496,00:13:52.290,-Where are you staying? -At the Carlton.
00:13:52.373,00:13:55.209,"No, you're not. You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street."
00:13:55.293,00:13:57.337,You come along with me. We'll have a little jaw over supper.
00:13:57.420,00:13:59.922,-Right you are. -Indian dialects always fascinated me.
00:14:00.006,00:14:02.050,"Buy a flower, kind sir. I'm short for me lodgings."
00:14:02.133,00:14:04.927,Liar. You said you could change half a crown.
00:14:05.678,00:14:09.390,"You ought to be stuffed with nails, you ought."
00:14:09.515,00:14:12.852,"Here, take the whole bloomin' basket for sixpence."
00:14:23.404,00:14:25.406,"-How many what? -Uh, Indian dialects."
00:14:28.201,00:14:29.827,are recorded as vernacular in India.
00:14:33.706,00:14:34.916,Oh!
00:14:39.128,00:14:43.049,"Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen? We've got a blooming heiress in our midst."
00:14:43.925,00:14:46.177,"Would you be looking for a good butler, Eliza?"
00:15:16.124,00:15:18.835,"Where you bound for this year, Eliza? Biarritz?"
00:19:41.430,00:19:45.476,"Come on, Alfie, let's go home now. This place is giving me the willies."
00:19:45.559,00:19:47.478,Home? What do you want to go home for?
00:19:47.770,00:19:51.107,"It's nearly five o'clock. My daughter, Eliza, will be along soon."
00:19:51.482,00:19:54.652,She ought to be good for a half a crown for a father what loves her.
00:19:54.735,00:19:57.613,Loves her? That's a laugh. You ain't been near her for months.
00:19:57.697,00:19:58.781,What's that got to do with it?
00:19:59.240,00:20:01.325,What's half a crown after all I've give her?
00:20:01.409,00:20:03.202,When did you ever give her anything?
00:20:03.703,00:20:05.538,Anything? I give her everything.
00:20:05.913,00:20:09.542,I give her the greatest gift any human being can give to another.
00:20:09.792,00:20:10.668,Life.
00:20:11.210,00:20:15.548,"I introduced her to this here planet, I did, with all its wonders and marvels."
00:20:15.756,00:20:18.384,"The sun that shines, the moon that glows."
00:20:18.551,00:20:21.470,"Hyde Park to walk through on a fine, spring night."
00:20:21.721,00:20:27.560,"The whole ruddy city of London to roam around in, selling her bloomin' flowers. I give her all that."
00:20:28.602,00:20:31.397,Then I disappear and leave her on her own to enjoy it.
00:20:31.731,00:20:36.026,"Now, if that ain't worth half a crown now and again, I'll take my belt off and give her what for."
00:20:36.110,00:20:37.445,"You got a good heart, Alfie."
00:20:37.528,00:20:41.323,"But you want that half a crown out of Eliza, you better have a good story to go with it."
00:20:43.826,00:20:46.579,"-Good morning, George. -Not a brass farthing."
00:21:39.465,00:21:41.801,Get your moving arse out of here. On with it.
00:22:07.827,00:22:09.119,Five pounds.
00:22:17.127,00:22:18.295,There she is.
00:22:30.015,00:22:33.176,"Hop along, Charlie. You're too old for me."
00:22:33.269,00:22:34.729,"Don't know your own daughter, Alfie?"
00:22:34.876,00:22:36.851,How you gonna find her if you don't know what she looks like?
00:23:08.345,00:23:11.974,"-Eliza, what a surprise. -Not a brass farthin'."
00:23:12.099,00:23:14.351,"Hey, here, you come here, Eliza."
00:23:14.435,00:23:19.189,I ain't gonna take me hard-earned wages and let you pass them on to a bloody pub keeper.
00:23:25.654,00:23:32.661,"Eliza, you wouldn't have the heart to send me home to your stepmother without a drop of liquid protection, now, would you?"
00:23:32.953,00:23:37.082,"-Stepmother indeed. -Well, I'm willing to marry her."
00:23:37.291,00:23:40.461,"It's me that suffers by it. I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza."
00:23:40.711,00:23:43.464,Just because I ain't a lawful husband.
00:23:43.964,00:23:47.885,"Oh, come on, slip your old dad just half a crown to go home on."
00:23:48.385,00:23:50.512,"Well, I had a bit of luck myself last night."
00:23:50.596,00:23:51.513,Yeah?
00:23:54.934,00:23:57.645,"But don't keep comin' around, countin' on half crowns from me."
00:24:33.639,00:24:35.975,The English that will keep her in the gutter till the end of her days?
00:24:38.394,00:24:42.439,"In six months, I could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball."
00:24:42.606,00:24:46.860,"I could even get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant, which requires better English."
00:25:05.671,00:25:10.009,"I could even get her a job as a lady's maid or a shop assistant, which requires better English."
00:25:37.161,00:25:39.413,"Now, how many vowel sounds do you think you heard altogether?"
00:25:39.538,00:25:41.123,I believe I counted 24.
00:25:41.206,00:25:42.499,-Wrong by a hundred. -What?
00:25:42.624,00:25:44.501,"To be exact, you heard 130."
00:25:44.918,00:25:46.336,"Now, listen to them one at a time."
00:25:46.503,00:25:49.298,Must I? I'm really quite done up for one morning.
00:26:15.824,00:26:17.117,"Your name, Miss."
00:26:17.284,00:26:20.245,"My name is of no concern to you, whatsoever."
00:26:30.506,00:26:34.093,"Oh, London is getting so dirty these days."
00:26:34.384,00:26:37.638,"I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper. Can I help you?"
00:26:37.805,00:26:39.348,"Oh, good morning, missus."
00:26:39.473,00:26:43.102,"-I'd like to see the professor, please. -Could you tell me what it's about?"
00:26:43.310,00:26:46.230,It's business of a personal nature.
00:26:46.814,00:26:49.233,"Oh. One moment, please."
00:26:59.076,00:27:01.787,"-Mr. Higgins. -What is it, Mrs. Pearce?"
00:27:01.995,00:27:04.289,"There's a young woman who wants to see you, sir."
00:27:04.373,00:27:05.582,A young woman?
00:27:08.043,00:27:10.587,"She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed."
00:27:10.838,00:27:14.716,"I should have sent her away, only I thought, perhaps, you wanted her to talk into your machine."
00:27:14.925,00:27:17.886,"-Has she an interesting accent? -Simply ghastly, Mr. Higgins."
00:27:17.970,00:27:20.264,"Good. Let's have her in. Show her in, Mrs. Pearce."
00:27:20.347,00:27:22.933,"-Very well, sir. It's for you to say. -You know, this is rather a bit of luck."
00:27:23.016,00:27:24.768,I'll show you how I make records.
00:27:25.269,00:27:36.029,"We'll set her talking and then, I'll take her down first in Bell's Visible Speech, then in Broad Romic and then, we'll get her on the phonograph so that you can turn her on whenever you want with the written transcript before you."
00:27:40.075,00:27:43.370,"-This is the young woman, sir. -Good morning, my good man."
00:27:43.453,00:27:46.206,"-Might I have the pleasure of a word-- -Oh, no, no, no."
00:27:46.290,00:27:48.083,This is the girl I jotted down last night.
00:27:48.167,00:27:51.295,She's no use. I've got all the records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo.
00:27:51.378,00:27:53.130,I'm not gonna waste another cylinder on that.
00:27:53.338,00:27:54.923,"Now, be off with you. I don't want you."
00:27:55.048,00:27:58.218,Don't be so saucy. You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.
00:27:58.468,00:28:01.305,"-Did you tell him I come in a taxi? -Nonsense, girl."
00:28:01.388,00:28:04.183,What do you think a gentleman like Mr. Higgins cares what you came in?
00:28:04.266,00:28:06.351,"Oh, we are proud."
00:28:06.518,00:28:09.438,"Well, he ain't above givin' lessons. Not 'im. I heard 'im say so."
00:28:09.730,00:28:15.903,"Well, I ain't come 'ere to ask for any compliment and if my money's not good enough, -I can go elsewhere. -Good enough for what?"
00:28:19.156,00:28:22.034,"Now you know, don't you? I'm come to have lessons, I am."
00:28:22.117,00:28:23.952,"And to pay for 'em, too. Make no mistake."
00:28:24.661,00:28:28.999,"Well… And, uh, what do you expect me to say?"
00:28:29.875,00:28:32.920,"Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think."
00:28:33.503,00:28:35.964,Don't I tell you I'm bringing you business?
00:28:36.965,00:28:40.552,"Pickering, should we ask this baggage to sit down or shall we just throw her out of the window?"
00:28:40.844,00:28:43.138,"Oh, I won't be called a baggage."
00:28:43.222,00:28:45.641,Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.
00:28:52.648,00:29:00.197,"I want to be a lady in a flower shop instead of sellin' at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, but they won't take me unless I can talk more genteel."
00:29:00.322,00:29:02.908,"He said he could teach me. Well, 'ere I am."
00:29:03.033,00:29:07.162,"Ready to pay 'im, not asking any favor and he treats me as if I was dirt."
00:29:07.829,00:29:11.917,I know what lessons cost as well as you do and I'm ready to pay.
00:29:14.795,00:29:15.963,How much?
00:29:16.505,00:29:18.590,Now you're talking.
00:29:18.730,00:29:22.970,I thought you'd come off it when you saw a chance of gettin' back a bit of what you chucked at me last night.
00:29:23.095,00:29:25.889,"-You'd had a drop in, hadn't you, eh? -Sit down."
00:29:26.431,00:29:29.351,"Oh, if you're goin' to make a compliment of it-- Sit down!"
00:29:30.519,00:29:33.230,"-Sit down, girl. Do as you're told. -Oh!"
00:29:33.397,00:29:34.481,What's your name?
00:29:34.856,00:29:36.525,Eliza Doolittle.
00:29:37.484,00:29:39.736,"Won't you sit down, Miss, uh, Doolittle?"
00:29:41.905,00:29:42.823,Oh.
00:29:46.910,00:29:52.124,"Now, uh… how much do you propose to pay me for these lessons?"
00:29:52.207,00:29:53.375,"Oh, I know what's right."
00:29:53.792,00:29:58.338,A lady friend of mine gets French lessons for 18 pence an hour from a real French gentleman.
00:29:59.006,00:30:03.760,"Well, you wouldn't have the face to ask me the same for teachin' me my own language as you would for French."
00:30:04.011,00:30:07.055,"So, I won't give more than a shillin'. Take it or leave it."
00:30:09.516,00:30:23.822,"You know, Pickering, if you think of a shilling not as a simple shilling, but as a percentage of this girl's income, it works out as fully equivalent of, uh… 60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire."
00:30:25.073,00:30:28.201,"By George, it's enormous. It's the biggest offer I ever had."
00:30:28.535,00:30:30.287,Sixty pounds?
00:30:30.912,00:30:32.914,What are you talkin' about? Where would I get 60 pounds?
00:30:32.998,00:30:35.000,-I never offered you 60 pounds! -Hold your tongue.
00:30:35.083,00:30:38.628,"-But I ain't got 60 pounds. -Oh, don't cry, you silly girl."
00:30:38.754,00:30:40.922,Sit down. Nobody's going to touch your money.
00:30:41.048,00:30:51.933,"Somebody's going to touch you with a broomstick Oh, anybody would think you was my father."
00:30:52.017,00:30:54.978,"If I decide to teach you, I'll be worse than two fathers to you."
00:30:55.604,00:30:57.022,"Oh, here."
00:30:57.898,00:31:00.108,-What's this for? -To wipe your eyes.
00:31:00.192,00:31:02.778,To wipe any part of your face that feels moist.
00:31:03.445,00:31:05.697,"And remember, that's your handkerchief and that's your sleeve."
00:31:05.781,00:31:08.867,And don't confuse one with the other if you want to become a lady in a shop.
00:31:09.201,00:31:11.578,"It's no use to talk to her like that, Mr. Higgins."
00:31:11.745,00:31:13.205,She doesn't understand you.
00:31:13.455,00:31:16.458,"Here, give the handkerchief to me. He gave it to me, not to you."
00:31:17.292,00:31:19.294,"Higgins, I'm interested."
00:31:19.503,00:31:23.465,"What about your boast that you could pass her off as a duchess at the Embassy Ball, eh?"
00:31:23.715,00:31:26.259,I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive if you can make that good.
00:31:26.426,00:31:30.347,I'll bet you all the expenses of the experiment that you can't do it.
00:31:31.014,00:31:32.474,I'll even pay for the lessons.
00:31:32.808,00:31:35.435,"Oh, you're real good. Thank you, captain."
00:31:41.566,00:31:43.485,She's so deliciously low.
00:31:43.944,00:31:45.529,So horribly dirty.
00:31:45.654,00:31:49.032,"I ain't dirty. I washed my face and hands before I come, I did."
00:31:50.492,00:31:52.994,I'll make a duchess of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.
00:31:53.078,00:31:55.455,-Oh! -We'll start today. Now. At this moment.
00:31:55.539,00:31:57.165,"Take her away, Mrs. Pearce and clean her."
00:31:57.249,00:31:59.040,Sandpaper if it won't come off any other way.
00:31:59.140,00:32:00.377,Is there a good fire in the kitchen?
00:32:00.460,00:32:03.630,"-Yes, but-- -Take all her clothes off and burn them and ring up and order new ones."
00:32:04.131,00:32:06.258,Just wrap her in brown paper till they come.
00:32:07.050,00:32:10.512,You're no gentleman. You're not to talk of such things.
00:32:10.679,00:32:12.180,"I'm a good girl, I am."
00:32:12.305,00:32:14.975,"And I know what the likes of you are, I do."
00:32:15.767,00:32:19.104,"We want none of your slum prudery here, young woman."
00:32:19.229,00:32:21.231,You've got to learn to behave like a duchess.
00:32:21.481,00:32:24.568,"Now, take her away, Mrs. Pearce. If she gives you any trouble, wallop her."
00:32:25.026,00:32:28.405,"-I'll call the police, I will. -But I've got no place to put her."
00:32:28.613,00:32:29.948,"Well, put her in the dustbin."
00:32:31.575,00:32:33.618,"Come, Higgins, be reasonable."
00:32:33.702,00:32:36.288,"You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins, really, you must."
00:32:36.371,00:32:38.832,You can't walk over everybody like this.
00:32:41.626,00:32:45.213,I… walk over everybody?
00:32:45.338,00:32:47.799,"My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering."
00:32:47.883,00:32:49.593,I had no intention of walking over anybody.
00:32:49.676,00:32:52.471,I merely suggested we should be kind to this poor girl.
00:32:52.846,00:32:57.225,I didn't express myself clearly because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy.
00:32:57.851,00:33:04.649,"-Or yours. -But, sir, you-- You can't take a girl up like that as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach."
00:33:04.900,00:33:05.901,Why not?
00:33:06.359,00:33:09.070,Why not? But you don't know anything about her.
00:33:09.279,00:33:11.907,What about her parents? She may be married.
00:33:12.157,00:33:13.533,Garn.
00:33:13.742,00:33:17.078,"There. As the girl very properly says, garn."
00:33:17.621,00:33:19.206,Who'd marry me?
00:33:21.791,00:33:23.793,"By George, Eliza."
00:33:24.377,00:33:31.635,The streets will be strewn with the bodies of men shooting themselves for your sake before I'm done with you.
00:33:32.928,00:33:35.263,Here. I'm going.
00:33:35.680,00:33:39.267,"He's off his chump, he is. I don't want no barmies teachin' me."
00:33:39.351,00:33:42.479,"Oh, mad, am I? All right, Mrs. Pierce, don't ring up and order those new clothes."
00:33:42.562,00:33:44.648,"-Throw her out. -Stop, Mr. Higgins, I won't allow it."
00:33:44.814,00:33:46.191,"Go home to your parents, girl."
00:33:46.316,00:33:48.151,I ain't got no parents.
00:33:48.318,00:33:51.238,There you are. She ain't got no parents. What's all the fuss? Nobody wants her.
00:33:51.321,00:33:54.699,"She's no use to anybody but me, -so take her upstairs. -But what's to become of her?"
00:33:54.824,00:33:58.203,"Is she to be paid anything? Oh, do be sensible, sir."
00:33:58.620,00:34:00.664,What would she do with money? She'll have food and clothes.
00:34:00.747,00:34:02.123,She'll only drink if you give her money.
00:34:02.332,00:34:06.795,"Oh, you are a brute. It's a lie! Nobody ever saw the sign of liquor on me."
00:34:06.920,00:34:09.714,"Oh, sir, you're a gentleman. Don't let 'im speak to me like that."
00:34:10.131,00:34:12.926,"Does it occur to you, Higgins, the girl has some feelings?"
00:34:13.385,00:34:15.887,"Oh, no, I don't think so. No feelings we need to worry about."
00:34:16.721,00:34:20.183,"-Well, have you, Eliza? -I got my feelin's same as anyone else."
00:34:20.308,00:34:23.812,"Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms the girl is to be here."
00:34:23.895,00:34:26.147,What's to become of her when you've finished your teaching?
00:34:26.231,00:34:28.024,"You must look ahead a little, sir."
00:34:28.108,00:34:30.151,What's to become of her if we leave her in the gutter?
00:34:30.235,00:34:31.319,"Answer me that, Mrs. Pearce."
00:34:31.486,00:34:33.822,"That's her own business, not yours, Mr. Higgins."
00:34:33.905,00:34:37.167,"When I'm done with her, we'll throw her back in the gutter, then it will be her own business again."
00:34:38.944,00:34:41.454,You've no feelin' heart in you.
00:34:41.830,00:34:44.124,You don't care for nothin' but yourself.
00:34:46.835,00:34:48.878,"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you ought."
00:34:48.962,00:34:50.422,"Have some chocolates, Eliza."
00:34:57.596,00:34:59.222,How do I know what might be in 'em?
00:34:59.389,00:35:02.058,I've 'eard of girls being drugged by the likes of you.
00:35:02.934,00:35:04.102,Pledge of good faith.
00:35:05.145,00:35:08.523,I'll take one half… and you take the other.
00:35:12.861,00:35:15.655,"You'll have boxes of them, barrels of them everyday."
00:35:16.156,00:35:17.616,"You'll live on them, eh?"
00:35:19.534,00:35:22.829,"I wouldn't have ate it, only I'm too ladylike to take it out of me mouth."
00:35:23.079,00:35:34.382,"Think of it, Eliza. Think of chocolates and taxis I don't want no gold and no diamonds. I'm a good girl, I am."
00:35:34.716,00:35:38.303,"Higgins, I really must interfere. Mrs. Pearce is quite right."
00:35:38.386,00:35:45.018,"If this girl's gonna put herself in your hands for six months for an experiment in teaching, she must understand thoroughly what she's doing."
00:35:46.227,00:35:47.103,Hmm.
00:35:48.438,00:35:56.279,"Eliza, you are to stay here for the next six months, learning how to speak beautifully, like a lady in a florist shop."
00:35:57.280,00:36:05.705,"If you're good and do whatever you're told, you shall sleep in a proper bedroom, have lots to eat and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis."
00:36:06.498,00:36:14.089,"But if you are naughty and idle, you shall sleep in the back kitchen amongst the black beetles and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick."
00:36:16.257,00:36:23.056,"At the end of six months, you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace in a carriage, beautifully dressed."
00:36:24.057,00:36:34.359,"If the king finds out that you're not a lady, the police will take you to the Tower of London where your head will be cut off as a warning to other presumptuous flower girls."
00:36:35.568,00:36:43.076,"But if you are not found out, you shall have a present of, uh, seven and six to start life with as a lady in a shop."
00:36:44.619,00:36:54.963,"If you refuse this offer, you will be the most ungrateful, wicked girl and the angels will weep for you."
00:36:59.843,00:37:01.219,"Now, are you satisfied, Pickering?"
00:37:01.386,00:37:03.096,I don't understand what you're talking about.
00:37:03.179,00:37:05.598,"Oh, could I put it more plainly or fairly, Mrs. Pearce?"
00:37:05.890,00:37:07.767,"-Come with me, Eliza. -That's right, Mrs. Pearce."
00:37:07.851,00:37:09.477,Bundle her off to the bathroom.
00:37:09.602,00:37:12.021,"You're a great bully, you are."
00:37:12.147,00:37:16.151,"I won't stay 'ere if I don't like it -and I won't let nobody wallop me. -Don't answer back, girl."
00:37:16.276,00:37:18.615,"If I'd known what I was lettin' myself in for, I wouldn't have come here."
00:37:18.765,00:37:22.031,"I've always been a good girl, I am and I won't be put upon!"
00:37:22.198,00:37:23.241,In six months.
00:37:23.324,00:37:25.243,In three if she has a good ear and a quick tongue.
00:37:25.326,00:37:27.829,I'll take her anywhere and I'll pass her off as anything.
00:37:27.954,00:37:30.373,I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch.
00:37:39.841,00:37:41.342,Not what you'd call a proper one.
00:37:41.426,00:37:44.554,"You know, you can't be a nice girl inside if you're dirty outside."
00:37:45.680,00:37:48.308,I'll have to put you in here. This will be your bedroom.
00:37:52.729,00:37:57.025,"Oh, I couldn't sleep here, missus. It's too good for the likes of me."
00:37:59.152,00:38:03.156,"I should be afraid to touch anythin'. I ain't a duchess yet, you know?"
00:38:09.454,00:38:12.373,"Oh, what's this? This where you wash clothes?"
00:38:12.457,00:38:15.877,"This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza. And where I'm going to wash you."
00:38:17.212,00:38:21.633,You expect me to get into that and wet myself all over? Not me.
00:38:28.056,00:38:29.849,I shall catch me death.
00:38:32.352,00:38:33.394,"Come along, now."
00:38:34.354,00:38:36.898,Come along. Take your clothes off.
00:38:38.775,00:38:41.444,"Come on, girl, do as you're told. Take your clothes off."
00:38:49.285,00:38:52.121,I won't. No! Take your hands off me!
00:38:52.205,00:38:53.706,"-No! No! -Oh, dear."
00:38:56.042,00:38:58.044,"-I won't. Let go. -Eliza, keep still."
00:39:09.681,00:39:12.600,-Take a bath. -No! No!
00:39:13.184,00:39:15.395,"I'm a good girl, I am."
00:39:15.478,00:39:18.189,"Well, they won't like the smell of you if you don't have a bath."
00:39:18.273,00:39:20.942,It ain't right! It ain't decent!
00:39:52.724,00:39:57.562,"Higgins, forgive the bluntness, but if I'm to be in this business, I shall feel responsible for the girl."
00:39:57.645,00:40:01.399,I hope it's clearly understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position.
00:40:04.235,00:40:07.196,"Come now, Higgins, you know what I mean. This is no trifling matter."
00:40:07.447,00:40:10.658,Are you a man of good character where women are concerned?
00:40:11.868,00:40:14.579,Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?
00:40:15.163,00:40:16.831,"Yes, very frequently."
00:40:17.415,00:40:18.291,"Well, I haven't."
00:40:18.583,00:40:25.340,"I find the moment I let a woman make friends with me, she becomes jealous, exacting, suspicious and a damned nuisance."
00:40:25.673,00:40:29.469,"And I find the moment that I make friends with a woman, I become selfish and tyrannical."
00:40:29.802,00:40:33.139,"So here I am, a confirmed, old bachelor and likely to remain so."
00:44:50.813,00:44:51.898,"Come on, Doolittle."
00:44:52.023,00:44:55.484,"And remember, drinks are to be paid for or not drunk."
00:44:59.614,00:45:01.616,Send the bill to Buckingham Palace. Come on.
00:45:01.741,00:45:05.203,"Well, Alfie, there's nothing else to do. I guess it's back to work."
00:45:05.328,00:45:09.332,What? Don't you dare mention that word in my presence again.
00:45:12.835,00:45:15.796,"I used to do that sort of thing once, just for exercise."
00:45:16.714,00:45:19.258,It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.
00:45:19.675,00:45:22.303,"Oh, don't worry, boys. We'll get out of this somehow."
00:45:22.470,00:45:24.347,"How do you think you're going to do that, Alfie?"
00:45:24.430,00:45:29.185,"How? Same as always. Faith, hope and a little bit of luck."
00:47:50.534,00:47:53.621,"-You make a good suffragette, Charlie. -Oh, get along with you."
00:48:00.503,00:48:02.338,"Why, there's the lucky man now."
00:48:02.630,00:48:05.132,The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.
00:48:06.008,00:48:07.760,What are you doing in Eliza's house?
00:48:10.721,00:48:13.140,"You can buy your own drinks now, Alfie Doolittle."
00:48:13.349,00:48:16.352,"-Fallen into a tub of butter, you have. -What are you talking about?"
00:48:16.477,00:48:18.229,"Your daughter, Eliza."
00:48:18.479,00:48:22.108,"-Oh, you're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle. -Well, what about Eliza?"
00:48:22.400,00:48:26.112,"Oh, he don't know. Her own father and he don't know."
00:48:30.282,00:48:32.410,"Moved in with a swell, Eliza has."
00:48:32.576,00:48:38.833,"Left here in a taxi all by herself, smart as paint -and ain't been home for three days. -Go on."
00:48:38.999,00:48:41.001,"Then this morning, I get a message from her."
00:48:41.335,00:49:04.733,She wants her things sent over to 27A never mind about sending any clothes.
00:49:08.237,00:49:13.534,"I knew she had a career in front of her. Harry, boy, we're in for a booze-up."
00:49:13.784,00:49:16.912,The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.
00:50:50.005,00:50:51.090,"The mail, sir."
00:50:51.590,00:50:53.676,Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.
00:51:02.101,00:51:07.064,Ai.
00:51:07.898,00:51:13.153,Ai.
00:51:32.298,00:51:35.175,Ai.
00:51:35.676,00:51:39.346,Ai!
00:51:39.430,00:51:41.932,You simply cannot go on working the girl this way.
00:51:42.099,00:51:47.396,"Making her say her alphabet over and over from sunup to sundown, even during meals."
00:51:47.521,00:51:49.982,You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?
00:51:50.065,00:51:51.859,"When she does it properly, of course."
00:51:52.026,00:51:53.444,"Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?"
00:51:53.902,00:51:57.197,"There's another letter from that American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford."
00:51:57.406,00:51:59.700,He still wants you to lecture for his Moral Reform League.
00:51:59.783,00:52:00.868,"Yes, well, throw it away."
00:52:00.951,00:52:02.870,"It's the third letter he's written you, sir."
00:52:02.953,00:52:07.082,"-You should at least answer it. -All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce. I'll try and get to it."
00:52:10.461,00:52:15.758,"If you please, sir, there's a dustman downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle, who wants to see you."
00:52:16.008,00:52:18.969,"-He says you have his daughter here. -Phew, I'd say."
00:52:20.179,00:52:21.680,"Well, send the blaggard up."
00:52:22.306,00:52:24.058,"He may not be a blaggard, Higgins."
00:52:24.266,00:52:26.310,"Nonsense. Of course he's a blaggard, Pickering."
00:52:27.061,00:52:29.563,"Whether he is or not, I'm afraid we'll have some trouble with him."
00:52:29.647,00:52:33.400,"No, I think not. Any trouble to be had, he'll have it with me, not I with him."
00:52:37.279,00:52:38.572,"Doolittle, sir."
00:52:48.165,00:52:49.041,Where?
00:52:49.958,00:52:51.794,"Oh, good morning, governor."
00:52:52.169,00:52:55.255,"I come about a very serious matter, governor."
00:52:58.759,00:53:00.719,Brought up in Hounslow.
00:53:01.512,00:53:03.222,"Mother Welsh, I should think."
00:53:04.515,00:53:05.724,"What is it you want, Doolittle?"
00:53:06.141,00:53:08.602,"I want my daughter, that's what I want, you see?"
00:53:08.811,00:53:11.146,"Well, of course you do. You're her father, aren't you?"
00:53:11.522,00:53:14.024,I'm glad to see you have a spark of family feeling left.
00:53:14.149,00:53:15.943,"She's in there. Yes, take her away at once."
00:53:16.902,00:53:17.986,What?
00:53:18.487,00:53:19.613,Take her away.
00:53:19.697,00:53:22.032,Do you think I am going to keep your daughter for you?
00:53:22.658,00:53:25.244,"Now, now, is this reasonable, governor?"
00:53:25.411,00:53:28.414,Is it fairity to take advantage of a man like that?
00:53:28.664,00:53:31.834,The girl belongs to me. You got her. Where do I come in?
00:53:32.418,00:53:36.213,How dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me.
00:53:36.672,00:53:38.298,You sent her here on purpose.
00:53:38.757,00:53:42.136,"Now, don't take a man up like that, governor."
00:53:42.219,00:53:43.470,"Oh, the police shall take you up."
00:53:43.554,00:53:46.682,"This is a plan, a plot to extort money by threats."
00:53:46.974,00:53:48.517,I shall telephone the police.
00:53:48.976,00:53:51.854,Have I asked you for a brass farthing?
00:53:52.521,00:53:55.524,I'll leave it to this gentleman 'ere. Have I said a word about money?
00:53:56.275,00:53:58.110,What else did you come for?
00:53:58.569,00:54:02.114,"Well, what would a bloke come for?"
00:54:09.621,00:54:14.376,"-Alfred, you sent her here on purpose. -So, help me, governor, I never did."
00:54:14.460,00:54:15.753,Then how did you know she was here?
00:54:15.836,00:54:18.464,"I'd tell you, governor, if you'd only let me get a word in."
00:54:18.922,00:54:21.842,I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting to tell you.
00:54:22.092,00:54:23.927,I'm waiting to tell you.
00:54:25.596,00:54:29.183,"You know, Pickering, this chap's got a certain natural gift of rhetoric."
00:54:29.850,00:54:32.853,Observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild.
00:54:32.936,00:54:35.147,I'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting to tell you.
00:54:35.272,00:54:38.817,I'm waiting to tell you. That's the Welsh strain in him.
00:54:39.651,00:54:41.987,How did you know Eliza was here if you didn't send her?
00:54:42.196,00:54:45.073,"Well, she sent back for her luggage and I got to 'ear about it."
00:54:45.741,00:54:47.993,She said she didn't want no clothes.
00:54:49.036,00:54:50.746,"What was I to think from that, governor?"
00:54:50.829,00:54:53.665,"I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?"
00:54:54.208,00:54:58.086,"So, you came here to rescue her from worse than death, eh?"
00:54:59.963,00:55:02.257,Yes. Mrs. Pearce!
00:55:02.800,00:55:06.094,"Uh, Mrs. Pearce, Eliza's father has come to take her away."
00:55:06.220,00:55:07.471,"Give her to him, will you?"
00:55:07.554,00:55:11.099,"Now, wait a minute, governor, wait a minute."
00:55:11.975,00:55:14.394,"You and me is men of the world, ain't we?"
00:55:15.145,00:55:17.356,"Oh, men of the world, are we?"
00:55:17.815,00:55:20.692,"-Yes, you better go, Mrs. Pearce. -I think so indeed, sir."
00:55:21.360,00:55:35.833,"Here, governor. I've, uh-- I've took a sort of a fancy to you and… If you want the girl, well, I ain't so set on having her back home again, but what I might be open to is an arrangement."
00:55:36.124,00:55:38.418,All I ask is my rights as a father.
00:55:38.710,00:55:42.506,You're the last man alive to expect me to let her go for nothing.
00:55:42.631,00:55:45.676,"Oh, I can see you're one of the straight sort, governor."
00:55:46.134,00:55:51.265,"So, uh, what's a five-pound note to you and what's Eliza to me?"
00:55:51.640,00:55:56.353,"I think you ought to know, Doolittle, that Mr. Higgins' intentions are entirely honorable."
00:55:57.104,00:56:00.691,"Well, of course they are, governor. If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50."
00:56:01.441,00:56:04.278,Do you mean to say you'd sell your own daughter for 50 pounds?
00:56:04.361,00:56:05.988,"Have you no morals, man?"
00:56:07.865,00:56:10.367,"No, no, I can't afford them, governor."
00:56:10.826,00:56:12.744,Neither could you if you was as poor as me.
00:56:13.203,00:56:20.836,"Not that I mean any harm, mind you, …why not me too, eh? Why not?"
00:56:21.461,00:56:25.299,"Well, look at-- look at it my way."
00:56:26.258,00:56:28.886,"What am I? I asked you, what am I?"
00:56:29.386,00:56:31.889,"I'm one of the undeserving poor, that's what I am."
00:56:31.972,00:56:33.515,"Now, think what that means to a man."
00:56:34.099,00:56:37.686,It means he's up against middle-class morality for all of time.
00:56:38.437,00:56:41.982,"If there's anything going and I puts in for a bit of it, it's always the same story."
00:56:42.190,00:56:44.109,"You're undeserving, so you can't have it."
00:56:45.277,00:56:57.372,"But my needs is as great as the most deserving widows that ever got money out of six different charities in one week I don't need less than a deserving man, I need more."
00:56:57.873,00:56:59.958,I don't eat less hearty than he does.
00:57:00.250,00:57:02.628,"And I drink, oh, a lot more."
00:57:03.211,00:57:04.630,I'm playing straight with you.
00:57:05.255,00:57:09.009,"I ain't pretending to be deserving. No, I'm undeserving."
00:57:09.551,00:57:13.305,And I mean to go on being undeserving. I like it and that's the truth.
00:57:13.639,00:57:28.946,"But will you take advantage of a man's nature to do him out of the price of his own daughter, what he's brought up, fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow till she's grown big enough to be interesting to you two gentlemen?"
00:57:29.988,00:57:34.201,"Well, is five pounds unreasonable? I put it to you."
00:57:34.743,00:57:35.911,And I leave it to you.
00:57:39.289,00:57:46.713,"You know, Pickering, if we took this man in hand for three months, he could choose between a seat in the cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales."
00:57:47.714,00:57:48.966,We'd better give him a fiver.
00:57:49.383,00:57:51.510,"He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid."
00:57:51.593,00:57:53.553,"Oh, not me, governor. So, help me, I won't."
00:57:53.720,00:57:56.098,Just one good spree for meself and the missus.
00:57:56.348,00:57:59.393,Giving pleasure to ourselves and employment to others.
00:57:59.643,00:58:02.312,And satisfaction to you that they ain't been thrown away.
00:58:02.437,00:58:03.855,You couldn't spend it better.
00:58:03.939,00:58:06.274,"Oh, this is irresistible. Let's give him ten."
00:58:06.566,00:58:09.486,"No, the missus wouldn't have the heart to spend ten, governor."
00:58:09.653,00:58:11.113,Ten pounds is a lot of money.
00:58:11.446,00:58:14.825,Makes a man feel prudent-like and then goodbye to happiness.
00:58:15.367,00:58:19.037,"No, you just give me what I ask, governor. Not a penny less, not a penny more."
00:58:19.538,00:58:22.791,"I rather draw the line at encouraging this sort of immorality, Doolittle."
00:58:22.874,00:58:25.043,"Why don't you marry that missus of yours, eh?"
00:58:25.127,00:58:27.796,"After all, marriage isn't so frightening. You married Eliza's mother."
00:58:28.630,00:58:29.840,"Who told you that, governor?"
00:58:30.298,00:58:33.135,"Well, nobody told me. I concluded, naturally."
00:58:37.347,00:58:40.308,"If we listen to this man for another minute, we shall have no convictions left."
00:58:40.559,00:58:43.353,"-Five pounds, I think you said. -Thank you, governor, thank you."
00:58:43.603,00:58:44.980,Are you sure you won't have ten?
00:58:45.063,00:58:48.942,"-No, no, perhaps another time. -I won't, I won't, I won't."
00:58:49.026,00:58:50.610,"I beg your pardon, miss."
00:58:53.530,00:58:55.073,"Blimey, it's Eliza."
00:58:55.490,00:58:58.076,"Well, I never thought she'd clean up so good-looking."
00:58:58.201,00:59:02.873,"-She does me credit, don't she, governor? -'Ere, what you doin' 'ere?"
00:59:02.998,00:59:06.793,"Now, now, now, you hold your tongue and don't you give these gentlemen none of your lip."
00:59:07.794,00:59:10.964,"If you have any trouble with her, governor, give her a few licks of the strap."
00:59:13.884,00:59:15.135,"Well, good morning, gentlemen."
00:59:20.265,00:59:23.769,There's a man for you. A philosophical genius of the first water.
00:59:24.102,00:59:34.071,"Mrs. Pearce, write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford and tell him if he wants a lecturer to get in touch with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle, a common dustman, one of the most original moralists in England."
00:59:34.237,00:59:36.907,"-Yes, sir. -'Ere, what did he come for?"
00:59:37.407,00:59:39.451,-Say your vowels. -I know my vowels.
00:59:39.534,00:59:41.870,"-I knew 'em before I come. -Well, if you know them, say them."
00:59:41.995,00:59:45.624,"-Ai, Eh, Aye, Ow, U. -Stop!"
00:59:46.124,00:59:48.335,"A, E, I, O, U."
00:59:48.794,00:59:51.838,"That's what said, Ai, Eh, Aye, Ow, U."
00:59:51.963,00:59:57.636,"That's what I been sayin' for three days -and I won't say them no more. -I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle, but try to understand."
00:59:57.969,01:00:01.181,"There's no use explaining, Pickering. As a military man, you ought to know that."
01:00:01.306,01:00:02.557,Drilling is what she needs.
01:00:02.641,01:00:04.976,"Now, leave her alone or she'll be turning to you for sympathy."
01:00:05.227,01:00:08.230,"Very well, if you insist, but have a little patience with her, Higgins."
01:00:08.522,01:00:09.523,Of course.
01:00:10.482,01:00:11.691,Now say A.
01:00:11.858,01:00:13.944,"You ain't got no heart, you ain't."
01:00:14.111,01:00:16.363,-A. -Ai!
01:00:16.446,01:00:18.532,-A. -Ai!
01:00:20.242,01:00:21.368,Eliza.
01:00:21.493,01:00:30.585,"I promise you, you'll say your vowels correctly before this day is out, or there'll be no lunch, no dinner and no chocolates."
01:03:43.987,01:03:45.488,A.
01:03:47.741,01:03:49.451,Ai.
01:03:52.787,01:03:54.748,Ai.
01:03:57.167,01:03:59.002,Ai.
01:04:02.672,01:04:05.133,"All right, Eliza, say it again."
01:04:05.842,01:04:16.311,The rine in Spine The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
01:04:16.686,01:04:19.564,"-Didn't I sie that? -No, Eliza, you didn't sie that."
01:04:19.647,01:04:21.024,You didn't even say that.
01:04:21.691,01:04:31.201,"Now, every night before you get into bed, where you used to say your prayers, I want you to say, The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain, 50 times."
01:04:31.659,01:04:35.080,You'll get much further with the Lord if you learn not to offend his ears.
01:04:36.623,01:04:37.832,Now for your Hs.
01:04:39.292,01:04:41.336,"Pickering, this is going to be ghastly."
01:04:41.419,01:04:43.380,"Control yourself, Higgins. Give the girl a chance."
01:04:43.463,01:04:45.965,"Oh, well, I suppose you can't expect her to get it right the first time."
01:04:46.466,01:04:48.218,"Come here, Eliza and watch closely."
01:04:50.095,01:04:54.140,Now… you see that flame?
01:04:55.266,01:04:58.728,"Every time you pronounce the letter H correctly, the flame will waver."
01:04:58.812,01:05:01.731,"And every time you drop your H, the flame will remain stationary."
01:05:01.898,01:05:03.358,That's how you'll know if you've done it correctly.
01:05:03.483,01:05:05.193,"In time, your ear will hear the difference."
01:05:05.693,01:05:09.072,"See it better in the mirror. Now, listen carefully."
01:05:10.198,01:05:16.663,"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen."
01:05:17.622,01:05:19.582,"Now, repeat that after me."
01:05:20.667,01:05:23.753,"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire hurricanes hardly ever happen."
01:05:24.337,01:05:30.760,"In 'Artford, 'Ereford and 'Ampshire -'urricanes 'ardly hever 'appen. -Oh, no, no, no."
01:05:30.844,01:05:32.971,Have you no ear at all?
01:05:33.054,01:05:35.181,"-Should I do it over? -No, please."
01:05:35.807,01:05:41.479,"Start from the very beginning. Just do this. Go, ha, ha, ha, ha."
01:05:43.064,01:05:47.026,"Ha, ha, ha, ha."
01:05:47.735,01:05:49.487,"Well, go on, go on, go on."
01:05:50.071,01:05:53.366,"Ha, ha, ha."
01:05:53.450,01:05:55.493,"Does the same thing hold true in India, Pickering?"
01:05:55.577,01:06:02.208,"Is there truly a habit not only dropping a letter like the letter H, but using it where it doesn't belong, like hever instead of ever?"
01:06:02.792,01:06:06.004,"Why is it that Slavs, when they learn English, have a tendency to do it with their G's?"
01:06:06.379,01:06:08.840,They say linger instead of linger.
01:06:08.965,01:06:12.385,And then they turn right around and say singer instead of singer.
01:06:12.886,01:06:18.016,"I've noticed the Slavs using it where it isn't needed, they learn English, they have to do it with their G's."
01:06:26.232,01:06:29.068,"-The girl, Higgins. -Go on, go on, go on."
01:06:29.235,01:06:30.528,-Go on. -Ha.
01:07:09.442,01:07:10.485,"Again, Eliza."
01:07:14.948,01:07:17.784,How kind of you to let me come.
01:07:17.867,01:07:20.411,No. Kind of you. Kind of you. Kind.
01:07:24.040,01:07:27.126,"-How kind of you to let me come. -No, no, no, no."
01:07:27.210,01:07:30.296,"Kind of you. Kind of you. It's like cup of tea, kind of you."
01:07:30.380,01:07:32.215,"Cup of tea. Say, cup of tea."
01:07:32.840,01:07:36.135,"-Cuppa tea. -No, no. A cup of tea."
01:07:36.844,01:07:39.222,"It's awfully good cake, this. I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it."
01:07:39.597,01:07:41.266,Hmm. First rate.
01:07:41.432,01:07:43.560,And those strawberry tarts are delicious.
01:07:55.947,01:07:56.864,"Again, Eliza."
01:07:57.323,01:07:59.742,"-Cuppa tea. -Oh, no."
01:08:00.285,01:08:01.536,Can't you hear the difference?
01:08:01.744,01:08:06.666,"Look, put your tongue forward until it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth."
01:08:07.125,01:08:10.753,"-And then say, cup. -Cup."
01:08:10.837,01:08:12.255,-Then say of. -Of.
01:08:12.338,01:08:15.174,"Then say, cup, cup, cup, of, of, of."
01:08:15.300,01:08:17.135,"-Cup, cup, cup, of, of, of. -Cup, cup, cup, of, of, of."
01:08:20.013,01:08:21.556,that was a glorious tea.
01:08:21.681,01:08:23.474,Why don't you finish that last strawberry tart?
01:08:26.102,01:08:28.229,"Shame to waste it. Oh, it won't be wasted."
01:08:28.563,01:08:31.733,I know somebody who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.
01:09:15.943,01:09:16.944,Four.
01:09:18.363,01:09:19.238,Five.
01:09:20.406,01:09:22.784,Six marbles.
01:09:24.077,01:09:30.208,"Now, I want you to read this and I want you to enunciate every word just as if the marbles were not in your mouth."
01:09:31.292,01:09:36.339,"With blackest moss, the flower-pots were thickly crusted, one and all."
01:09:36.839,01:09:37.882,Each word clear as a bell.
01:09:45.181,01:09:47.892,I can't. I can't.
01:09:47.975,01:09:50.978,"I say, Higgins, are those pebbles really necessary?"
01:09:51.187,01:09:55.358,"If they were necessary for Demosthenes, they are necessary for Eliza Doolittle."
01:09:55.858,01:09:56.943,"Go on, Eliza."
01:10:01.781,01:10:08.037,"-were thickly crusted, one and-- -I can't understand a word, not a word."
01:10:08.162,01:10:14.001,"With blackest moss, the flower-pots were thickly crusted, one and all."
01:10:16.879,01:10:20.258,"Why don't you try something simpler, like The Owl and the Pussycat?"
01:10:20.425,01:10:22.760,"Oh, yes, that's a charming one."
01:10:22.885,01:10:25.930,"Well, Pickering, I can't hear a word the girl is saying."
01:10:29.892,01:10:31.102,What's the matter?
01:10:32.437,01:10:33.479,I swallowed one.
01:10:33.855,01:10:35.690,"Oh, it doesn't matter, I got plenty more. Open your mouth."
01:10:35.815,01:10:37.942,"One, two."
01:11:17.023,01:11:23.905,The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
01:11:24.363,01:11:28.117,I can't! I'm so tired.
01:11:28.201,01:11:30.787,I'm so tired.
01:11:31.120,01:11:34.165,"For God's sake, Higgins, it must be three o'clock in the morning."
01:11:42.465,01:11:45.593,"if I can go on with a blistering headache, you can."
01:11:52.308,01:11:55.603,I know your head aches. I know you're tired.
01:11:56.020,01:11:59.857,I know your nerves are as raw as meat in a butcher's window.
01:12:02.276,01:12:05.530,But think what you're trying to accomplish.
01:12:06.280,01:12:09.075,Just think what you're dealing with.
01:12:10.576,01:12:15.998,"The majesty and grandeur of the English language, it's the greatest possession we have."
01:12:17.250,01:12:27.385,"The noblest thoughts that ever flowed through the hearts of men are contained in its extraordinary, imaginative and musical mixtures of sounds."
01:12:28.719,01:12:31.973,"And that's what you've set yourself out to conquer, Eliza."
01:12:33.724,01:12:36.811,And conquer it you will.
01:13:02.670,01:13:03.796,"Now, try it again."
01:13:07.967,01:13:16.183,The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
01:13:18.102,01:13:19.061,What was that?
01:13:25.568,01:13:33.034,The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
01:13:39.290,01:13:40.416,Again.
01:14:16.661,01:14:17.828,Bravo!
01:15:30.026,01:15:31.944,Ho! Hey!
01:15:47.418,01:15:51.005,"We're making fine progress, Pickering. I think the time has come to try her out."
01:15:52.298,01:15:54.050,"Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?"
01:15:54.133,01:15:55.676,"Yes, I'm feeling fine, Mrs. Pearce. How are you?"
01:15:55.801,01:15:57.136,"-Very well, sir, thank you. -Oh, good."
01:15:57.219,01:15:59.889,Let's test her in public and see how she fares.
01:16:00.014,01:16:03.934,"Mr. Higgins, I was awakened by a dreadful pounding."
01:16:04.018,01:16:05.352,Do you know what it might have been?
01:16:05.436,01:16:07.313,"Pounding? I didn't hear any pounding. You do, Pickering?"
01:16:07.646,01:16:08.647,No.
01:16:08.731,01:16:11.108,"You know, Mrs. Pierce, if this goes on, you'd better see a doctor."
01:16:11.275,01:16:13.277,I know. We'll take her to the races.
01:16:16.155,01:16:17.656,"You'll consult your mother first, of course?"
01:16:17.907,01:16:19.075,"Oh, yes, of course."
01:16:21.911,01:16:23.788,"Uh, no, I think I should better surprise her."
01:16:23.871,01:16:24.830,"Now, let's go to bed."
01:16:25.206,01:16:27.708,"First thing in the morning, we'll go out and we'll buy her a dress."
01:16:32.004,01:16:34.256,What better time to work than early in the morning?
01:16:35.216,01:16:37.218,Where does one buy a lady's gown?
01:16:37.301,01:16:39.512,"-Whitley's, of course. -How do you know that?"
01:16:39.845,01:16:41.055,Common knowledge.
01:16:41.555,01:16:47.812,Let's not buy her anything too flowery. I despise those gowns with sort of weeds here and weeds there.
01:16:48.062,01:16:54.944,"I wanna buy something sort of simple and modest and elegant is what's called for. Perhaps, with a-- with a bow."
01:17:02.952,01:17:04.995,I think the strain is beginning to show.
01:17:05.121,01:17:09.208,"Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says, you must put down your books and go to bed."
01:24:46.456,01:24:47.332,Mother.
01:24:49.459,01:24:51.545,Henry. What a disagreeable surprise.
01:24:51.670,01:24:52.754,"Hello, Mother."
01:24:53.505,01:24:55.549,-How nice you look. -What are you doing here?
01:24:55.632,01:24:57.926,You promised never to come to Ascot. Go home at once.
01:24:58.093,01:25:00.679,"-I can't, Mother. I'm here on business. -Oh, no, Henry, you must."
01:25:00.762,01:25:02.514,"Now, I'm quite serious. You'll offend all my friends."
01:25:02.598,01:25:04.766,"The moment they meet you, I'd never see them again."
01:25:05.183,01:25:06.768,"Besides, you aren't even dressed for Ascot."
01:25:06.893,01:25:10.480,"I changed my shirt. Now, listen, Mother, I've got a job for you, a phonetics job."
01:25:10.689,01:25:12.816,-I've picked up a girl. -Henry.
01:25:12.899,01:25:15.110,"Oh, no, darling, not a love affair. She's a flower girl."
01:25:15.193,01:25:18.655,"I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball, but I wanted to try her out first."
01:25:18.739,01:25:21.033,"-I beg your pardon? -Well, you know the Embassy Ball."
01:25:21.116,01:25:25.162,"Of course, I know the ball, but-- So, I invited her to your box today, do you understand?"
01:25:25.370,01:25:26.872,Common flower girl?
01:25:26.997,01:25:28.957,"Well, she'll be all right. I taught her how to speak properly."
01:25:29.041,01:25:31.168,She has strict instructions as to her behavior.
01:25:31.293,01:25:34.546,She is to keep to two subjects; the weather and everybody's health.
01:25:34.838,01:25:36.131,Fine day and How do you do?
01:25:36.214,01:25:38.091,And not just let herself go on things in general.
01:25:38.175,01:25:40.010,"Help her along, darling. You'll be quite safe."
01:25:40.093,01:25:42.220,Safe? To talk about one's health in the middle of a race?
01:25:42.304,01:25:43.972,"Well, she's got to talk about something."
01:25:44.723,01:25:46.975,-Where is the girl now? -She's being pinned.
01:25:47.059,01:25:49.019,Some of the clothes we bought her didn't quite fit.
01:25:49.186,01:25:51.063,I told Pickering we should have taken her with us.
01:25:55.108,01:25:58.403,"-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill. -Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins."
01:25:59.488,01:26:02.407,"-You know my son, Henry. -Oh, how do you do?"
01:26:02.866,01:26:05.327,-I've seen you somewhere before. -I don't know.
01:26:05.410,01:26:06.703,"Oh, it doesn't matter. You better sit down."
01:26:10.248,01:26:11.249,Lady Boxington.
01:26:11.333,01:26:13.001,Where the devil can they be?
01:26:13.377,01:26:15.045,-Lord Boxington-- -Ha!
01:26:50.622,01:26:53.792,"Thank you, Mrs. Higgins. May I introduce Ms. Eliza Doolittle?"
01:27:00.674,01:27:02.926,-Lady Boxington. -How do you do?
01:27:03.260,01:27:05.595,-How do you do? -Lord Boxington.
01:27:05.721,01:27:07.681,-How do you do? -How do you do?
01:27:07.764,01:27:10.434,"-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Ms. Doolittle. -How do you do?"
01:27:10.642,01:27:11.601,How do you do?
01:27:15.480,01:27:17.023,How do you do?
01:27:19.317,01:27:20.569,How do you do?
01:27:21.653,01:27:22.612,Ms. Doolittle.
01:27:23.238,01:27:26.032,"Good afternoon, Prof. Higgins."
01:27:35.542,01:27:38.420,"The first race was very exciting, Ms. Doolittle."
01:27:38.545,01:27:40.756,I'm so sorry that you missed it.
01:27:40.839,01:27:42.424,"Will it rain, do you think?"
01:27:43.008,01:27:47.304,The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.
01:27:52.225,01:28:01.735,"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire, What is wrong with that, young man?"
01:28:01.860,01:28:04.112,-I bet I got it right. -Smashing.
01:28:04.780,01:28:07.240,Hasn't it suddenly turned chilly?
01:28:07.783,01:28:11.286,I do hope we won't have any unseasonable cold spells.
01:28:11.411,01:28:13.371,They bring on so much influenza.
01:28:13.538,01:28:16.249,And the whole of our family is susceptible to it.
01:28:16.416,01:28:19.127,My aunt died of influenza.
01:28:19.377,01:28:20.837,"So, they said."
01:28:21.129,01:28:24.800,But it's my belief they done the old woman in.
01:28:28.094,01:28:29.846,"Yes, Lord love you."
01:28:30.013,01:28:36.144,Why should she die of influenza when she come through diphtheria right enough the year before?
01:28:36.561,01:28:38.980,"Fairly blue with it, she was."
01:28:39.481,01:28:41.316,They all thought she was dead.
01:28:41.441,01:28:52.327,"But my father, Then she come to so sudden."
01:28:52.577,01:28:55.121,She bit the bowl off the spoon.
01:28:56.373,01:28:57.332,Dear me.
01:28:58.875,01:29:04.089,"Now, what call would a woman with that strength in her have to die of influenza?"
01:29:04.923,01:29:09.302,And what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me?
01:29:11.680,01:29:13.807,Somebody pinched it.
01:29:15.308,01:29:20.564,"And what I say is, them that's pinched it done her in."
01:29:21.606,01:29:24.317,"Done her in? Done her in, did you say?"
01:29:24.901,01:29:26.486,Whatever does it mean?
01:29:26.653,01:29:28.572,"Oh, that's the new small talk."
01:29:28.697,01:29:31.324,"Uh, to do somebody in means to kill them."
01:29:31.950,01:29:35.120,But you surely don't believe your aunt was killed?
01:29:35.579,01:29:36.872,Do I not?
01:29:37.038,01:29:41.960,"Them she lived with would have killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat."
01:29:44.796,01:29:47.591,to pour spirits down her throat like that.
01:29:48.133,01:29:49.634,It might have killed her.
01:29:49.843,01:29:51.136,Not her.
01:29:51.344,01:29:53.930,Gin was mother's milk to her.
01:29:54.180,01:29:59.436,"Besides, he poured so much down his own throat, he knew the good of it."
01:29:59.895,01:30:01.563,Do you mean that he drank?
01:30:01.771,01:30:04.774,"Drank, my word, something chronic."
01:30:08.445,01:30:11.698,"Here, what are you sniggering at?"
01:30:11.948,01:30:15.410,It's the new small talk. You do it so awfully well.
01:30:15.660,01:30:19.247,"Well, if I was doing it proper, what was you sniggering at?"
01:30:20.206,01:30:23.877,"-Have I said anything I oughtn't? -Oh, no."
01:30:24.377,01:30:25.879,"Uh, not at all, my dear."
01:30:26.129,01:30:28.298,"Well, that's a mercy, anyhow."
01:30:30.216,01:30:35.597,"-What I always say-- -I don't know whether there's time before the next race to place a bet, but come, my dear."
01:30:38.683,01:30:40.518,I should be so happy if you would take it.
01:30:40.644,01:30:42.395,You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.
01:30:43.021,01:30:45.732,-That's very kind of you. -His name is Dover.
01:31:08.171,01:31:11.716,"Come on. Come on, Dover. Come on."
01:31:12.092,01:31:13.760,"Come on, Dover."
01:31:14.052,01:31:15.345,Come on.
01:31:19.391,01:31:23.353,"Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin' arse!"
01:31:46.459,01:31:47.961,"You're not serious, Henry."
01:31:48.044,01:31:50.171,You don't expect to take her to the Embassy Ball?
01:31:50.255,01:31:51.506,Don't you think she's ready for it?
01:31:51.965,01:31:54.467,"Dear, Henry, she's ready for a canal barge."
01:31:54.551,01:32:02.267,"Well, her language may need a little refining, but-- Oh, really, Henry? If you cannot see how impossible this whole project is, then you must be absolutely potty about her."
01:32:02.373,01:32:05.603,I advise you to give it up now and not put yourself and this girl through more.
01:32:05.770,01:32:08.606,"Give it up? Why, it’s the most fascinating venture I've undertaken."
01:32:08.690,01:32:10.442,Pickering and I are at it from morning till night.
01:32:10.525,01:32:16.114,"It fills our whole lives. Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza, -listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza. -What?"
01:32:17.240,01:32:20.326,You're a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll.
01:32:20.827,01:32:22.037,"-Ah, here's the car. -Ah."
01:33:30.897,01:34:37.463,"I say, sir, uh… -Yes, sir? -Uh, is Miss Doolittle in?"
01:34:37.672,01:34:39.132,Whom shall I say is calling?
01:34:39.382,01:34:45.138,"Freddy Eynsford-Hill. Oh, if she doesn't remember who I am, tell her I'm the chap who was sniggering at her."
01:34:45.889,01:34:48.224,"-Yes, sir. -And will you give her these?"
01:34:48.558,01:34:50.560,"Yes, sir. Wouldn't you like to come in, sir?"
01:34:50.643,01:34:52.478,"They're having dinner, but you may wait in the hall."
01:34:52.562,01:34:55.523,"No, no, thank you. I want to drink in the street where she lives."
01:34:56.149,01:34:57.192,"Yes, sir."
01:36:45.717,01:36:47.468,"I'm terribly sorry, sir."
01:36:47.677,01:36:50.722,Ms. Doolittle says she doesn't want to see anyone ever again.
01:36:50.847,01:36:52.598,But why? She was unbelievable.
01:36:52.682,01:36:54.100,"So, I've been told, sir."
01:36:54.225,01:36:57.937,-Is there any further message? -Yes. Tell her that I'll wait.
01:36:58.313,01:37:00.732,"Oh, but it might be days, sir, even weeks."
01:37:00.815,01:37:02.942,But don't you see? I'll be happier here.
01:37:47.820,01:37:50.656,"It really is, Higgins. It's inhuman to continue."
01:37:50.782,01:37:53.576,Do you realize what you've got to teach this poor girl within six weeks?
01:37:53.659,01:37:58.915,"Gotta teach her to walk, talk, address a duke, a lord, a bishop, an ambassador. It's absolutely impossible."
01:37:59.582,01:38:03.044,"Higgins, I'm trying to tell you that I want to call off the bet."
01:38:03.169,01:38:07.423,"I know you're a stubborn man, but so am I. This experiment is over."
01:38:07.548,01:38:11.094,And nothing short of an order from the king could force me to recant.
01:38:11.928,01:38:16.224,"Now, if you'll excuse me. You understand, Higgins, it's over."
01:38:16.349,01:38:17.350,Higgins.
01:38:18.017,01:38:26.150,"Higgins, if there's any mishap at the embassy tonight, if Miss Doolittle suffers any embarrassment, whatever, -it'll be on your head alone. -Oh, Eliza can do anything."
01:38:26.234,01:38:27.860,Suppose she's discovered? Remember Ascot?
01:38:27.944,01:38:29.779,Suppose she makes another ghastly mistake?
01:38:29.862,01:38:32.407,"There will be no horses at the ball, Pickering."
01:38:37.120,01:38:39.330,"Oh, if anything happened tonight, I don't know what I'd do."
01:38:39.956,01:38:43.334,"-You could always re-join your regiment. -This is no time for flippancy, Higgins."
01:38:43.501,01:38:47.463,The way you've driven the girl the last six weeks has exceeded all bounds of common decency.
01:38:47.922,01:38:49.549,"For God's sake, can you stop pacing up and down?"
01:38:49.632,01:38:50.758,Can't you settle somewhere?
01:38:50.925,01:38:52.760,Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.
01:38:52.885,01:38:54.178,I'm not nervous.
01:38:55.847,01:38:57.306,-Where is it? -On the piano.
01:38:59.684,01:39:00.601,"The car is here, sir."
01:39:00.685,01:39:02.437,"-Oh, good. Tell Ms. Doolittle. -Yes, sir."
01:39:02.562,01:39:05.898,Tell Ms. Doolittle indeed. I bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.
01:39:06.149,01:39:08.401,I warned you about these French designers.
01:39:08.526,01:39:11.529,"We should've gone to a good English shop, everyone would've been on our side."
01:39:11.612,01:39:13.531,"-Have a glass of port? -No, thank you."
01:39:20.580,01:39:24.375,Are you so sure this girl will retain everything you've hammered into her?
01:39:25.334,01:39:26.669,"Well, we shall see."
01:39:27.253,01:39:28.254,Suppose she doesn't?
01:39:30.131,01:39:31.632,I lose my bet.
01:39:31.883,01:39:35.511,"Higgins, there's one thing I can't stand about you, that's your confounded complacency."
01:39:35.595,01:39:39.932,"At a moment like this, with so much at stake, it's utterly indecent that you don't need a glass of port."
01:39:42.810,01:39:44.061,And what about the girl?
01:39:44.145,01:39:46.147,You act as though she doesn't matter at all.
01:39:46.772,01:39:49.233,"Oh, rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters."
01:39:49.775,01:39:51.903,What do you think I've been doing all these months?
01:39:52.153,01:39:59.410,What could possibly matter more than to take a human being and change her into a different human being by creating a new speech for her?
01:40:00.036,01:40:05.333,It's filling up the deepest gap that separates class from class and soul from soul.
01:40:06.292,01:40:08.211,"No, she matters immensely."
01:40:33.861,01:40:37.198,"-Thank you, Colonel Pickering. -Don't you think so, Higgins?"
01:40:40.243,01:40:42.995,Not bad. Not bad at all.
01:43:22.780,01:43:26.242,"Major General, the right honorable, Sir James Clarence."
01:43:28.077,01:43:30.037,Marquis and Marquise of Glenning.
01:43:32.331,01:43:34.417,Lady Suzanna De Longly.
01:43:36.836,01:43:39.422,Sir Albert and Lady Derring.
01:43:40.047,01:43:43.509,Honorable Mr. Archibald and Lady Catherine Herring.
01:43:43.592,01:43:45.803,Maestro. Maestro.
01:43:48.180,01:43:50.933,-Don't you remember me? -No. Who the devil are you?
01:43:51.225,01:43:54.645,"I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest, your best pupil."
01:43:54.770,01:43:57.106,I'm Zoltan Karpathy. That marvelous boy.
01:43:58.649,01:44:00.568,I made your name famous throughout Europe.
01:44:00.693,01:44:02.445,"You teach me phonetics, you cannot forget me."
01:44:02.528,01:44:03.904,Why don't you have your hair cut?
01:44:03.988,01:44:07.867,"Ah, well, I don't have your imposing appearance, your figure, your brow."
01:44:07.950,01:44:09.952,"If I had my hair cut, nobody would notice me."
01:44:10.035,01:44:11.829,Where did you get all these old coins?
01:44:11.954,01:44:13.748,These are decorations for language.
01:44:14.206,01:44:15.916,The Queen of Transylvania is here this evening.
01:44:16.000,01:44:18.586,"I'm indispensable to her at these official, international parties."
01:44:18.753,01:44:22.131,"I speak 32 languages, I know everyone in Europe."
01:44:22.214,01:44:26.177,-No impostor can escape my detection. -Professor Karpathy.
01:44:28.512,01:44:29.722,The Greek Ambassador.
01:44:30.890,01:44:31.932,Greek my foot.
01:44:32.141,01:44:34.769,"He pretends not to know any English, but he cannot deceive me."
01:44:38.147,01:44:43.110,He speaks English so villainously that he cannot utter a word without betraying his origin.
01:44:43.944,01:44:47.406,"I help him pretend, but I make him pay through the nose. I make them all pay."
01:44:47.531,01:44:49.158,"Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs."
01:44:49.241,01:44:51.327,"-Her Excellency asked for you. -Oh, excuse me."
01:45:16.143,01:45:18.562,Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.
01:45:20.773,01:45:23.234,Sir Guy and Lady Skot Ackland.
01:45:43.337,01:45:45.422,The Count and Countess Demerau.
01:45:46.340,01:45:48.509,Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.
01:45:49.009,01:45:51.512,Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.
01:45:52.513,01:45:55.057,Lord and Lady Clanders.
01:45:55.891,01:45:58.477,"Ms. Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering."
01:45:58.978,01:46:02.565,"Ms. Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering."
01:46:02.940,01:46:05.276,"-Professor Higgins. -Good evening, Ms. Doolittle."
01:46:05.442,01:46:06.527,Your Excellency.
01:46:06.610,01:46:08.571,-Ms. Doolittle. -How do you do?
01:46:09.071,01:46:11.031,"-Good evening, colonel. -Good evening."
01:46:11.699,01:46:12.700,"-Oh, colonel. -Ah."
01:46:17.454,01:46:21.584,"Oh, a cousin of mine and Higgins. Excuse me."
01:46:22.001,01:46:23.127,Professor Higgins.
01:46:23.294,01:46:27.506,Such a faraway look as if she's always lived in a garden.
01:46:27.798,01:46:29.884,"So she has, a sort of garden."
01:46:58.996,01:47:02.333,Henry must take Eliza home at once. There's a language expert here.
01:47:02.416,01:47:04.752,"Sort of, you know, sort of impostorologist."
01:47:04.835,01:47:06.170,I beg your pardon.
01:47:06.337,01:47:08.005,The young lady with Colonel Pickering.
01:47:09.006,01:47:10.341,Find out who she is.
01:47:10.966,01:47:11.884,With pleasure.
01:47:12.635,01:47:14.428,The whole situation is highly explosive.
01:47:20.893,01:47:23.437,"Tell me, Zoltan, some more about the Greek ambassador."
01:47:23.520,01:47:26.941,"Gladly, but first I would love you to present me to this glorious creature."
01:47:38.285,01:47:44.333,"Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania and his Royal Highness, Prince Gregor."
01:48:30.838,01:48:32.840,Charming. Quite charming.
01:48:34.466,01:48:35.759,"Ms. Doolittle, ma'am."
01:49:05.706,01:49:07.541,This is a beautiful ball gown.
01:50:12.439,01:50:14.733,"Ms. Doolittle, my son would like to dance with you."
01:51:10.247,01:51:11.248,Eliza?
01:53:31.179,01:53:32.597,"Well, Mr. Higgins?"
01:53:32.973,01:53:35.934,"A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph."
01:53:36.435,01:53:40.022,"Higgins, you were superb. Absolutely superb."
01:53:40.105,01:53:42.983,"Tell us the truth now, weren't you a little bit nervous once or twice?"
01:53:43.066,01:53:45.235,-No. Not for a second. -Not during the whole evening?
01:53:45.316,01:53:47.195,Doesn't matter when I told you we were gonna win hands down.
01:53:47.279,01:53:49.573,"I felt like a bear in a cage, hanging about with nothing to do."
01:53:49.656,01:53:51.450,It was an immense achievement.
01:53:51.533,01:53:54.161,"If I hadn't backed myself to do it, I'd have given it up two months ago."
01:53:54.244,01:53:57.706,-Absolutely fantastic. -A lot of tomfoolery.
01:53:57.789,01:53:59.791,"Higgins, I salute you."
01:53:59.875,01:54:02.419,"Oh, silly people don't know their own silly business."
01:55:33.552,01:55:35.429,Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.
01:55:35.512,01:55:37.556,"If it hadn't been for him, I would've died of boredom."
01:55:37.639,01:55:40.225,Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian? Was he there?
01:55:40.350,01:55:42.978,"Yes, he was there, all right and up to his old tricks."
01:56:44.498,01:56:45.373,No.
01:57:19.783,01:57:22.536,"Not only Hungarian, but of royal blood."
01:58:37.444,01:58:39.904,Now I can go to bed without dreading tomorrow.
01:58:46.661,01:58:48.955,"Good night, Higgins. It's been a great occasion."
01:58:49.039,01:58:50.081,"Good night, Pickering."
01:58:51.541,01:58:52.834,"Oh, Mrs. Pearce?"
01:58:53.835,01:58:54.836,"Oh, damn."
01:58:55.378,01:58:58.131,I meant to ask her to give me coffee in the morning instead of tea.
01:58:58.590,01:59:00.300,"Leave a little note for her, will you, Eliza?"
01:59:00.634,01:59:01.760,And put out the lights.
01:59:53.269,01:59:54.813,Leave my head behind one of these days.
01:59:55.105,01:59:57.273,What the devil have I done with my slippers?
02:00:00.235,02:00:01.903,Here are your slippers.
02:00:03.154,02:00:04.239,There!
02:00:05.281,02:00:07.117,And there!
02:00:07.450,02:00:11.454,Take your slippers and may you never have a day's luck with them.
02:00:11.996,02:00:13.289,What on Earth?
02:00:13.873,02:00:15.291,What's the matter? Is anything wrong?
02:00:15.709,02:00:18.712,"No, nothing wrong with you. I won your bet for you, haven't I?"
02:00:18.920,02:00:21.548,"That's enough for you. I don't matter, I suppose."
02:00:22.382,02:00:25.343,You won my bet? You presumptuous insect.
02:00:25.427,02:00:27.721,I won it. What did you throw those slippers at me for?
02:00:27.804,02:00:31.057,"Because I wanted to smash your face. I could kill you, you selfish brute."
02:00:31.141,02:00:33.518,Why didn't you leave me where you picked me up in the gutter?
02:00:33.601,02:00:36.813,"You thank God it's all over now, you can throw me back again there, do you?"
02:00:37.355,02:00:39.941,"Oh, so the creature's nervous after all."
02:00:43.570,02:00:45.864,"Claws in, you cat. How dare you show your temper to me."
02:00:45.947,02:00:47.198,Sit down and be quiet.
02:00:47.282,02:00:51.411,"Oh, what's to become of me? What's to become of me?"
02:00:53.511,02:00:55.161,How the devil do I know what's to become of you?
02:00:55.261,02:00:56.733,What does it matter what becomes of you?
02:00:56.833,02:00:59.294,You don't care. I know you don't care.
02:00:59.878,02:01:01.004,You wouldn't care if I was dead.
02:01:01.087,02:01:03.882,I'm nothing to you. Not as much as them slippers.
02:01:04.007,02:01:06.134,-Those slippers? -Those slippers.
02:01:06.885,02:01:08.720,I didn't think it meant any difference now.
02:01:12.265,02:01:14.851,Why have you suddenly begun going on like this?
02:01:15.351,02:01:17.479,May I ask if you complain of your treatment here?
02:01:17.979,02:01:20.398,-No. -Has anybody behaved badly?
02:01:20.482,02:01:22.776,-Colonel Pickering? Mrs. Pearce? -No.
02:01:23.693,02:01:26.279,"Well, you don't pretend that I have treated you badly?"
02:01:27.739,02:01:28.823,-No. -No.
02:01:29.282,02:01:30.366,I'm glad to hear that.
02:01:31.534,02:01:34.329,"Perhaps, you're tired after the strain of the day."
02:01:34.996,02:01:37.540,"Would you, uh, would you have a chocolate?"
02:01:37.791,02:01:38.792,No!
02:01:39.751,02:01:40.710,Thank you.
02:01:42.462,02:01:48.343,"Well, it's only natural that you should be anxious, but it's all over now. Nothing more to worry about."
02:01:48.551,02:01:51.137,"No, nothing more for you to worry about."
02:01:52.764,02:01:55.683,"Oh, God, I wish I was dead."
02:01:56.100,02:01:58.812,"Why? In heaven's name, why?"
02:01:59.521,02:02:03.107,"Now, listen to me, Eliza. All this irritation is purely subjective."
02:02:03.566,02:02:07.111,-I don't understand. I'm too ignorant. -It's just imagination.
02:02:07.195,02:02:09.239,Nothing's wrong. Nobody's hurting you.
02:02:09.531,02:02:15.119,"Now, you go to bed and sleep it off. Have a little cry and say your prayers and you'll feel very much more comfortable."
02:02:15.662,02:02:19.374,"I heard your prayers, Thank God it's all over."
02:02:19.457,02:02:23.586,"Well, don't you thank God it's all over and how you're free and you can do what you like."
02:02:23.795,02:02:27.173,"Oh, what am I fit for? What have you left me fit for?"
02:02:27.715,02:02:30.218,Where am I to go? What am I to do?
02:02:30.301,02:02:32.971,And what's to become of me?
02:02:34.222,02:02:37.350,"Oh, that's what's worrying you, is it?"
02:02:38.685,02:02:40.603,"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you."
02:02:40.687,02:02:43.690,I'm sure you won't have any difficulty in settling yourself somewhere or other.
02:02:47.527,02:02:49.571,I didn't quite realize you were going away.
02:02:51.531,02:02:53.157,"You might marry, you know."
02:02:53.867,02:02:57.787,"You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the colonel."
02:02:57.912,02:03:00.915,"Most men are the marrying sort, poor devils."
02:03:01.583,02:03:02.625,And you're not bad-looking.
02:03:02.709,02:03:04.460,You're really quite a pleasure to look at sometimes.
02:03:05.503,02:03:13.845,"Well, not now, of course, when you've been crying you look like the very devil, but I mean, when you're all right and quite yourself, you're what I would call attractive."
02:03:15.138,02:03:20.143,"Now, you go to bed and have a good night's rest, then get up and have a look at yourself in the glass, you won't feel so bad."
02:03:25.773,02:03:29.444,I dare say my mother might find some fellow or other who'd do very well.
02:03:29.736,02:03:31.696,We were above that at Covent Garden.
02:03:31.905,02:03:33.031,What do you mean?
02:03:33.573,02:03:36.034,"I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself."
02:03:36.910,02:03:39.871,"Now, you've made a lady of me, I'm not fit to sell anything else."
02:03:40.246,02:03:45.835,"Oh, tosh, Eliza, don't insult human relations by dragging all that cant about buying and selling into it."
02:03:46.044,02:03:47.883,You don't have to marry the fellow if you don't want to.
02:03:48.171,02:03:50.757,"-What else am I to do? -Well, lots of things."
02:03:51.841,02:03:54.135,What about the old idea of a florist shop?
02:03:54.344,02:03:56.763,I'm sure Pickering would set you up in one. He's got lots of money.
02:03:57.472,02:03:59.098,He paid for all those togs you're wearing tonight.
02:03:59.182,02:04:02.727,And that with the hire of the jewelry will make a big hole in 200 pounds.
02:04:03.770,02:04:06.105,"Oh, come on now. You'll be all right."
02:04:07.315,02:04:09.901,"Well, I must be off to bed. I'm really devilish sleepy."
02:04:11.861,02:04:13.571,I was looking for something. What was it?
02:04:14.238,02:04:15.323,Your slippers.
02:04:15.949,02:04:18.534,"Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me."
02:04:19.827,02:04:24.290,"Before you go, sir… Hmm?"
02:04:25.875,02:04:28.753,…do my clothes belong to me or to Colonel Pickering?
02:04:30.171,02:04:31.923,What the devil use would they be to Pickering?
02:04:32.215,02:04:34.050,Why do you bother about that in the middle of the night?
02:04:34.175,02:04:35.889,I want to know what I may take away with me.
02:04:36.018,02:04:37.728,I don't wanna be accused of stealing.
02:04:39.013,02:04:40.390,Stealing?
02:04:41.307,02:04:44.268,"You shouldn't have said that, Eliza. That shows a-- a want of feeling."
02:04:44.519,02:04:46.521,I'm sorry. I'm only a common ignorant girl.
02:04:46.604,02:04:48.231,"In my station, I have to be careful."
02:04:48.648,02:04:51.693,There can't be any feelings between the likes of you and the likes of me.
02:04:51.985,02:04:54.570,"Please, will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesn't?"
02:04:56.239,02:04:58.282,Take the whole damned houseful if you want.
02:04:58.783,02:05:00.952,"Except the jewelry, that's hired. Will that satisfy you?"
02:05:01.160,02:05:02.537,"Stop, please."
02:05:04.956,02:05:07.917,Will you take these to your room and keep them safe?
02:05:08.793,02:05:11.212,I don't want to run the risk of them being missed.
02:05:14.841,02:05:19.637,"If these belonged to me and not the jeweler, I'd-- I'd ram them down your ungrateful throat."
02:05:19.804,02:05:23.933,The ring isn't the jeweler's. It's the one you bought me in Brighton.
02:05:25.143,02:05:26.394,I don't want it now.
02:05:29.814,02:05:31.315,Don't you hit me!
02:05:32.108,02:05:35.278,"Hit you? You infamous creature, how dare you suggest such a thing."
02:05:35.361,02:05:38.072,It's you who've hit me. You-- you've wounded me to the heart.
02:05:38.156,02:05:41.909,I'm glad. I've got a little of my own back anyhow.
02:05:42.910,02:05:46.122,"You've caused me to lose my temper, a thing that's hardly happened to me before."
02:05:46.622,02:05:49.042,I don't wish to discuss it further tonight. I'm going to bed.
02:05:49.417,02:05:53.671,You better leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee for it won't be done by me.
02:05:53.796,02:05:57.592,"Damn Mrs. Pearce, damn the coffee and damn you."
02:05:58.593,02:06:06.350,And damn my own folly for having lavished my hard-earned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe.
02:09:08.532,02:09:09.575,Darling.
02:09:10.868,02:09:12.745,"Freddy, whatever are you doing here?"
02:09:12.828,02:09:16.707,Nothing. I spend most of my nights here. It's the only place where I'm happy.
02:09:16.791,02:09:18.334,"Don't laugh at me, Ms. Doolittle."
02:09:18.501,02:09:22.546,"Don't you call me Ms. Doolittle, do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me."
02:09:24.382,02:09:28.010,"Oh, Freddy, you don't think I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?"
02:09:28.427,02:09:31.430,"Darling, how could you imagine such a thing? You know how I feel."
02:09:31.597,02:09:33.307,I've written two or three times a day telling you.
02:09:33.391,02:09:34.350,Sheets and sheets.
02:11:42.353,02:11:44.146,"-Eliza, where are you going? -To the river."
02:11:44.230,02:11:46.023,-What for? -To make a hole in it.
02:11:47.858,02:11:49.485,"Eliza, darling, what do you mean?"
02:12:21.642,02:12:23.561,"Darling, shall I come with you?"
02:13:24.079,02:13:25.206,"Yes, please."
02:14:01.450,02:14:04.328,"Oh, good morning, miss. Can I help you?"
02:14:16.799,02:14:17.716,Huh?
02:14:19.051,02:14:21.011,"-Yes? -Oh, excuse me, miss."
02:14:21.136,02:14:22.972,For a second I thought you were somebody else.
02:14:23.097,02:14:25.432,"-Who? -Forgive me, ma'am."
02:14:25.641,02:14:27.726,Early morning light playing tricks with my eyes.
02:14:28.394,02:14:29.645,"Can I get you a taxi, ma'am?"
02:14:29.853,02:14:32.856,A lady like you shouldn't be walking alone around London this hour of the morning.
02:14:35.651,02:14:36.735,"No, thank you."
02:15:25.326,02:15:27.745,We value your patronage always.
02:15:27.828,02:15:31.081,"Oh, thank you, my good man. Thank you. Here. Come here."
02:15:31.582,02:15:34.335,Take the missus on a trip to Brighton with my compliments.
02:15:37.421,02:15:40.716,"Charming spot this, Harry. We must visit it more often."
02:15:41.592,02:15:42.676,Father?
02:15:44.762,02:15:46.138,"Oh, no."
02:15:46.597,02:15:48.349,"You see, Harry, he has no mercy."
02:15:48.432,02:15:51.101,"Sent her down to spy on me in me misery, he did."
02:15:51.185,02:15:52.853,Me own flesh and blood.
02:15:55.481,02:15:58.525,"Well, I'm miserable all right. You can tell 'im that straight."
02:15:58.651,02:16:01.028,What are you talking about? What you dressed up for?
02:16:01.236,02:16:05.240,As if you didn't know. Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
02:16:05.491,02:16:06.867,Tell 'im what he's done to me.
02:16:07.159,02:16:08.535,What's he done to you?
02:16:09.119,02:16:10.245,"Ruined me, that's all."
02:16:10.579,02:16:14.333,Tied me up and delivered me into the 'ands of middle-class morality.
02:16:14.625,02:16:15.834,And don't you defend 'im.
02:16:16.251,02:16:31.183,"Was it 'im or was it not 'im, wrote to an old American blighter named Wallingford who was givin' five millions to fund moral reform societies to tell 'im the most original moralist in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle, a common dustman."
02:16:33.102,02:16:34.937,Sounds like one of his jokes.
02:16:35.354,02:16:38.315,You may call it a joke. It's put the lid on me proper.
02:16:38.816,02:16:43.237,The old bloke died and left me 4000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.
02:16:44.571,02:16:46.573,Who asked 'im to make a gentleman out of me?
02:16:46.740,02:16:48.659,"I was happy, I was free."
02:16:49.201,02:16:52.788,"I touched pretty nigh everyone for money when I wanted it, same as I touched 'im."
02:16:53.539,02:16:57.042,"Now, I'm tied neck and 'eels and everybody touches me."
02:16:57.835,02:17:03.132,"A year ago, I 'adn't a relation in the world except one or two who wouldn't speak to me."
02:17:03.632,02:17:04.675,Now I've 50.
02:17:04.967,02:17:07.094,Not a decent week's wages amongst the lot of them.
02:17:07.970,02:17:10.639,"Oh, I 'ave to live for others now, not for myself."
02:17:11.181,02:17:12.891,Middle-class morality.
02:17:13.308,02:17:16.186,"Come on, Alfie. Another couple of hours and we have to be at the church."
02:17:16.562,02:17:19.314,"-Church? -Yeah, church."
02:17:19.898,02:17:21.650,The deepest cut of all.
02:17:22.317,02:17:25.028,"Well, why do you think I'm dressed up like a ruddy pallbearer?"
02:17:26.071,02:17:27.823,Your stepmother wants to marry me.
02:17:27.990,02:17:30.701,"Now I'm respectable, she wants to be respectable."
02:17:32.536,02:17:33.996,why don't you give the money back?
02:17:34.621,02:17:41.044,"That's the tragedy of it, Eliza. It's easy to say chuck it, but I 'aven't the nerve."
02:17:41.837,02:17:45.215,"We're all intimidated. That's what we are, intimidated. Bought up."
02:17:45.549,02:17:47.384,Yeah. That's what I am.
02:17:48.010,02:17:50.554,That's what your precious professor's brought me to.
02:17:50.721,02:17:52.890,Not my precious professor.
02:17:53.432,02:17:55.392,"Oh, sent you back, has he?"
02:17:57.019,02:18:02.191,"First he shoves me in the middle class, then he chucks you out for me to support you."
02:18:02.524,02:18:04.067,That's all part of his plan.
02:18:05.152,02:18:06.653,But you double-cross 'im.
02:18:07.738,02:18:09.364,Don't you come back 'ome to me.
02:18:10.032,02:18:12.117,Don't you take tuppence from me.
02:18:12.451,02:18:15.537,You stand on your own two feet. You're a lady now and you can do it.
02:18:16.121,02:18:19.333,"Yeah, that's right, Eliza. You're a lady now."
02:18:19.666,02:18:21.752,"Eliza, it's getting awfully cold in that taxi."
02:18:21.919,02:18:25.881,"Here, Eliza, would you like to come and see me turned off this morning, eh?"
02:18:26.048,02:18:28.091,"St. George's 'Anover Square, ten o'clock."
02:18:28.926,02:18:30.761,"I wouldn't advise it, but you're welcome."
02:18:30.886,02:18:32.554,"-No, thank you, Dad. -No."
02:18:33.639,02:18:35.098,"Are you all finished here, Eliza?"
02:18:36.350,02:18:39.520,"Yes, Freddy. I'm all finished here."
02:18:43.190,02:18:44.191,"Good luck, Dad."
02:18:45.067,02:18:46.318,"Thank you, Eliza."
02:19:03.877,02:19:07.047,"-Oh, come along, Alfie. -'ow much time have I got left?"
02:19:18.642,02:19:21.895,There's drinks and girls all over London.
02:19:26.733,02:19:28.277,"Set 'em up, me darlin'."
02:25:07.365,02:25:09.993,Pickering. Pickering. Didn't she even say where to send her clothes?
02:25:10.076,02:25:11.953,"I told you, sir. She took them all with her."
02:25:13.371,02:25:15.207,Here's a confounded thing. Eliza's bolted.
02:25:15.332,02:25:16.458,-Bolted? -Bolted. Last night.
02:25:16.541,02:25:18.752,Mrs. Pearce let her go without telling me a thing about it.
02:25:18.877,02:25:20.128,"-Well, I'm dashed. -What am I to do?"
02:25:20.212,02:25:21.796,I got tea this morning instead of coffee.
02:25:21.880,02:25:23.924,I don't know where anything is. I don't know where my appointments are.
02:25:24.090,02:25:26.760,"Eliza would know. Of course, she'd know, but damn it, she's gone."
02:25:26.843,02:25:28.951,Did either of you gentlemen frighten her last night?
02:25:29.151,02:25:31.056,Last night. We hardly said a word to her. You were there.
02:25:31.223,02:25:32.807,Did you bully her after I went to bed?
02:25:32.891,02:25:34.809,The other way around. She threw the slippers at me.
02:25:34.935,02:25:36.436,I never gave her the slightest provocation.
02:25:36.519,02:25:39.147,"The slippers suddenly came, bang, at my head before I uttered a word."
02:25:39.272,02:25:41.524,Used the most disgraceful language. I was shocked.
02:25:41.608,02:25:43.109,"-Well, I'm dashed. -I don't understand."
02:25:43.193,02:25:44.736,We've always given her every consideration.
02:25:44.819,02:25:46.947,"-She admitted it herself. -Well, I'm dashed."
02:25:47.072,02:25:50.116,"Oh, Pickering, for God's sake, stop being dashed and do something."
02:25:50.200,02:25:51.493,"-What? -Well, phone the police."
02:25:51.576,02:25:53.036,What are they there for in heaven's name?
02:25:53.119,02:25:57.999,"Mr. Higgins, you can't give Eliza's name to the police as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella."
02:25:58.083,02:25:59.751,But why not? I want to find the girl.
02:26:00.043,02:26:02.128,She belongs to me. I paid five pounds for her.
02:26:03.129,02:26:05.799,"Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please."
02:26:06.049,02:26:08.051,"-Get me some coffee, would you please? -Yes, sir."
02:26:08.134,02:26:11.763,"Mrs., um-- Scotland Yard? Pierce, of course. I beg your pardon, yes."
02:26:11.846,02:26:14.975,This-- This is Colonel Pickering speaking.
02:26:15.100,02:26:18.853,Hugh Pickering. 27A Wimpole Street.
02:26:19.354,02:26:21.564,I want to report a missing person.
02:26:22.232,02:26:25.068,"A Miss Eliza Doolittle, yeah."
02:26:25.485,02:26:26.486,About 21.
02:26:27.529,02:26:30.573,"Oh, I should say about 5'7."
02:26:31.825,02:26:32.784,Her eyes?
02:26:33.201,02:26:37.956,"Oh, let me think now. Her eyes, her eyes, uh… -Brown. -Brown, yeah."
02:26:38.957,02:26:41.501,"No, no, no. Her hair?"
02:26:41.876,02:26:47.173,"Oh, good Lord. Let me… Well, sort of nondescript neutral sort of-- Brown, brown, brown."
02:26:47.257,02:26:49.884,"You heard what he said? Brown, brown, brown, yes."
02:26:49.968,02:26:53.346,"No, no, no, this is her residence. 27A-- Yeah."
02:26:53.763,02:26:56.308,"About between 3:00 and 4:00 this morning, I understand."
02:26:56.850,02:27:00.437,"Yes. No, no, no. Rela-- No, she's no relation, no."
02:27:00.687,02:27:04.232,"What? Well, just let's call her a good friend, shall we?"
02:27:04.941,02:27:06.067,I beg your pardon?
02:27:06.484,02:27:09.446,"Listen to me, my man, I don't like the tenor of that question."
02:27:09.571,02:27:11.990,What the girl does here is our affair.
02:27:12.991,02:27:16.536,Your affair is to get her back so that she can continue doing it.
02:27:17.078,02:27:18.413,"Well, I'm dashed."
02:27:35.138,02:27:38.099,"Higgins, I have an old school chum at the Home Office."
02:27:38.183,02:27:40.643,"Perhaps, he can help. Think I'll give him a ring."
02:28:02.082,02:28:05.460,"Oh, I want to speak to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please."
02:28:05.543,02:28:07.629,"Brew-- Yes, I'll wait."
02:28:13.093,02:28:17.097,"Pickering, why can't a woman be more like a man?"
02:28:17.889,02:28:18.932,I beg your pardon?
02:29:03.059,02:29:03.935,Of course not.
02:29:06.146,02:29:07.105,Nonsense.
02:29:09.649,02:29:10.525,Never.
02:29:52.901,02:29:54.944,"Oh, hello. Mr. Brewster Budgin there?"
02:29:56.946,02:30:00.408,"Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never never guess who this is."
02:30:01.910,02:30:03.870,"You're quite right, yes, it is. Good heavens."
02:30:04.120,02:30:05.622,"By George, what a memory."
02:30:06.623,02:30:07.916,"How are you, Bruzzie?"
02:30:08.374,02:30:09.501,Nice to hear your voice.
02:30:10.335,02:30:13.505,"What? Oh, don't say that. Is it already 30 years? Good heavens."
02:30:14.130,02:30:15.423,"You're quite right. Yes, oceans of water."
02:30:15.507,02:30:17.759,"Listen, listen, Bruzzie, I'll tell you why I rang up."
02:30:17.842,02:30:19.802,Something rather unpleasant's happened this end.
02:30:19.886,02:30:20.929,Could I come and see you?
02:30:21.137,02:30:23.348,"Hmm. Well, I could. Yes, now, straight away."
02:30:23.765,02:30:26.518,"Right-o, good. Thank you, thank you. Goodbye, Bruzzie. Thank you very much."
02:30:34.567,02:30:37.612,"Oh, Mrs. Pearce, I'm going along to the Home Office."
02:30:38.071,02:30:40.365,"Oh, I do hope you find her, Colonel Pickering."
02:30:40.490,02:30:42.116,Mr. Higgins will miss her.
02:30:42.242,02:30:46.120,"Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh? Blast Mr. Higgins. I'll miss her."
02:30:52.418,02:30:53.336,Pickering?
02:30:58.049,02:30:59.259,"Oh, Mrs. Pearce?"
02:31:01.636,02:31:03.388,"He's gone to the Home Office, sir."
02:31:04.472,02:31:05.932,"Oh, there you are."
02:31:06.182,02:31:08.643,I'm disturbed and he runs for help.
02:31:08.726,02:31:10.144,"Now, there's a good fellow."
02:31:11.646,02:31:14.315,"Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman."
02:32:12.457,02:32:19.047,"Do you mean to say that after you'd done this wonderful thing for them without making a single mistake, they just sat there, never said a word to you?"
02:32:19.130,02:32:22.925,Never petted you or admired you or told you how splendid you'd been?
02:32:23.051,02:32:26.929,"Not a word. They just sat there, congratulating each other on how marvelous they'd been."
02:32:27.055,02:32:31.184,And the next moment on how glad they were it was all over and what a bore it had all been.
02:32:31.434,02:32:32.769,This is simply appalling.
02:32:32.894,02:32:36.314,"I should not have thrown my slippers at him, I should've thrown the fire irons."
02:32:38.483,02:32:41.402,Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.
02:32:42.779,02:32:48.701,"Now, remember, you not only danced with a prince last night, you behaved like a princess."
02:32:56.125,02:33:03.549,"Mother, the most confounded thing. Do you… You?"
02:33:04.175,02:33:07.011,"Good afternoon, Professor Higgins Are you quite well?"
02:33:08.179,02:33:09.931,-Am I-- -Of course you are.
02:33:10.014,02:33:13.017,You are never ill. Would you care for some tea?
02:33:13.643,02:33:16.468,Don't you dare try that game on me. I taught it to you.
02:33:16.618,02:33:18.468,"Now, you get up and come home and stop being a fool."
02:33:18.573,02:33:20.157,You've caused me enough trouble for one morning.
02:33:20.218,02:33:24.153,"Very nicely put indeed, Henry. No woman could resist such an invitation."
02:33:24.237,02:33:25.947,How did this baggage get here in the first place?
02:33:26.072,02:33:28.908,Eliza came to see me this morning and I was delighted to have her.
02:33:29.075,02:33:31.786,"And if you don't promise to behave yourself, I must ask you to leave."
02:33:31.869,02:33:37.834,You mean to say I'm to put on my Sunday manners for this thing that I created out of the squashed cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?
02:33:37.917,02:33:41.087,"-That's precisely what I mean. -Well, I'll see her damned first."
02:33:41.421,02:33:44.298,However did you learn good manners with my son around?
02:33:44.757,02:33:46.175,It was very difficult.
02:33:46.551,02:33:50.680,I should never have known how ladies and gentlemen behave if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.
02:33:53.391,02:33:57.520,He always showed me that he felt and thought about me as if I were something better than a common flower girl.
02:34:01.524,02:34:10.366,"You see, Mrs. Higgins, apart from the things one can pick up, the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she is treated."
02:34:13.828,02:34:19.083,I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins because he always treats me as a flower girl and always will.
02:34:20.626,02:34:25.548,But I know I shall always be a lady to Colonel Pickering because he always treats me as a lady and always will.
02:34:31.053,02:34:32.513,"Henry, don't grind your teeth."
02:34:32.638,02:34:35.057,"The bishop is here, madam. Shall I show him into the garden?"
02:34:35.475,02:34:37.810,"The bishop and the professor? Good heavens, no."
02:34:38.060,02:34:41.439,I should be excommunicated. I'll see him in the library.
02:34:42.815,02:34:48.154,"Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things, I give you full permission to have him evicted."
02:34:48.529,02:34:52.909,"Henry, dear, I suggest you stick to two subjects, the weather and your health."
02:35:20.394,02:35:22.522,"Well, you've had a bit of your own back, as you call it."
02:35:22.688,02:35:25.983,Have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable or do you want any more?
02:35:26.359,02:35:30.947,You want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you.
02:35:31.364,02:35:32.949,I didn't say I wanted you back at all.
02:35:33.032,02:35:34.700,"Oh, indeed? Then what are we talking about?"
02:35:34.784,02:35:36.410,"Well, about you, not about me."
02:35:36.577,02:35:38.871,"If you come back, you'll be treated as you've always been treated."
02:35:38.996,02:35:41.499,I can't change my nature. I don't intend to change my manners.
02:35:41.582,02:35:44.377,My manners are exactly the same as Colonel Pickering's.
02:35:44.460,02:35:47.880,That's not true. He treats a flower girl as if she were a duchess.
02:35:48.381,02:35:50.550,"Well, I treat a duchess as if she was a flower girl."
02:35:50.633,02:35:53.177,"-Oh, I see. The same to everybody. -Just so."
02:35:53.344,02:36:03.938,"You see, the great secret, Eliza, is not a question of good manners or bad manners or any particular sort of manners, but having the same manner for all human souls."
02:36:05.398,02:36:10.695,"The question is not whether I treat you rudely, whether you've ever heard me treat anyone else better."
02:36:11.404,02:36:15.199,I don't care how you treat me. I don't mind your swearing at me.
02:36:15.283,02:36:17.577,I shouldn't mind a black eye. I've had one before this.
02:36:17.660,02:36:19.537,But I won't be passed over.
02:36:19.787,02:36:21.747,"Well, then get out of my way, for I won't stop for you."
02:36:21.873,02:36:23.708,You talk about me as though I was a motor bus.
02:36:23.833,02:36:28.045,"So, you are a motor bus. All bounce and go and no consideration for anybody."
02:36:28.546,02:36:31.340,But I can get along without you. Don't you think I can't.
02:36:31.465,02:36:33.259,I know you can. I told you you could.
02:36:37.179,02:36:42.101,"You've never wondered, I suppose whether-- whether I could get along without you."
02:36:43.477,02:36:45.313,Don't you try to get around me.
02:36:45.730,02:36:46.772,You'll have to.
02:36:47.732,02:36:49.984,"So, I can, without you or any soul on earth."
02:36:53.571,02:36:54.989,"I shall miss you, Eliza."
02:36:55.406,02:36:57.825,I've learned something from your idiotic notions.
02:36:58.367,02:37:00.912,"I confess that, humbly and gratefully."
02:37:03.873,02:37:06.000,"Well, you have my voice on your gramophone."
02:37:06.334,02:37:08.502,"When you feel lonely without me, you can turn it on."
02:37:09.003,02:37:10.463,It has no feelings to hurt.
02:37:17.762,02:37:20.306,"Oh, you are a devil."
02:37:20.932,02:37:25.686,You can twist the heart in a girl just as easily as someone can twist her arms to hurt her.
02:37:26.103,02:37:27.980,What am I to come back for?
02:37:28.272,02:37:30.441,For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.
02:37:30.524,02:37:33.110,And you may throw me out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want me to.
02:37:33.194,02:37:36.739,"Yes, and you may walk out tomorrow if I don't do everything you want me to."
02:37:36.822,02:37:39.158,"-And live with my father? -Yes, or sell flowers."
02:37:39.241,02:37:40.451,Or would you rather marry Pickering?
02:37:40.534,02:37:44.038,I wouldn't marry you if you asked me and you're nearer my age than what he is.
02:37:44.121,02:37:46.082,-Than he is. -I'll talk as I like.
02:37:46.165,02:37:47.708,You're not my teacher now.
02:37:47.875,02:37:50.378,That's not what I want and you don't think it is.
02:37:50.836,02:37:52.922,I've always had chaps enough wanting me that way.
02:37:53.089,02:37:56.133,Freddy Hill writes me twice and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.
02:37:56.342,02:38:00.096,"Oh, in short, you want me to be as infatuated about you as he is. Is that it?"
02:38:00.346,02:38:01.681,"No, I don't."
02:38:01.806,02:38:04.225,That's not the sort of feeling I want from you.
02:38:05.393,02:38:07.228,I want a little kindness.
02:38:07.770,02:38:10.815,"I know I'm a common, ignorant girl and you're a book-learned gentleman."
02:38:11.190,02:38:13.359,But I'm not dirt under your feet.
02:38:13.859,02:38:25.955,"What I done… What I did was not for the taxis and the dresses, but because we were pleasant together and I come to… Came to care for you."
02:38:26.288,02:38:32.753,"Not to want you to make love to me and not forgetting the difference between us, but more friendly-like."
02:38:34.964,02:38:36.966,"Well, of course. That's how I feel."
02:38:37.967,02:38:39.719,And how Pickering feels.
02:38:40.094,02:38:43.180,"-Eliza, you're a fool. -That's not the proper answer to give me."
02:38:43.305,02:38:45.099,It's the only answer till you stop being an idiot.
02:38:45.182,02:38:51.689,"If you're gonna be a lady, you'll have to give up feeling neglected, if the men you know don't spend half their time sniveling over you and the other half giving you black eyes."
02:38:51.981,02:38:54.650,"You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish, don't you?"
02:38:54.734,02:38:56.444,Be off with you to the sort of people you like.
02:38:56.544,02:39:01.811,Marry some sentimental hog with lots of money and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you with.
02:39:02.036,02:39:04.577,"If you can't appreciate what you've got, you better get what you can appreciate."
02:39:04.744,02:39:06.495,"Oh, I can't talk to you."
02:39:06.787,02:39:09.749,You always turn everything against me. I'm always in the wrong.
02:39:10.207,02:39:14.211,But don't be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down.
02:39:14.545,02:39:17.423,"I'll marry Freddy, I will, soon as I'm able to support him."
02:39:18.340,02:39:19.633,Freddy?
02:39:20.009,02:39:24.096,That poor devil who couldn't get a job as an errand boy even if he had the guts to try for it?
02:39:24.346,02:39:28.100,"Woman, don't you understand? I've made you a consort for a king."
02:39:28.350,02:39:31.187,Freddy loves me. That makes him king enough for me.
02:39:31.395,02:39:34.106,I don't want him to work. He wasn't brought up to it as I was.
02:39:34.440,02:39:35.983,I'll go and be a teacher.
02:39:36.484,02:39:38.069,"What will you teach, in heaven's name?"
02:39:38.611,02:39:40.988,What you taught me. I'll teach phonetics.
02:39:42.073,02:39:44.867,"Ha, ha, ha!"
02:39:45.576,02:39:49.663,I'll offer myself as an assistant to that brilliant Hungarian.
02:39:50.706,02:39:54.627,"What, that impostor? That humbug? That toadying ignoramus?"
02:39:54.752,02:39:56.962,"Teach him my methods, my discoveries?"
02:39:57.046,02:39:59.632,You take one step in that direction and I'll wring your neck.
02:39:59.715,02:40:03.469,Wring away. What do I care? I knew you'd strike me one day.
02:40:06.430,02:40:09.475,"Ah, that's done you, Henry Higgins, it has."
02:40:09.558,02:40:12.686,"Now, I don't care that for your bullying and your big talk."
02:40:40.005,02:40:41.715,You impudent hussy.
02:40:41.799,02:40:46.053,There's not an idea in your head or a word in your mouth that I haven't put there.
02:41:53.913,02:41:55.915,You brazen hussy.
02:42:39.875,02:42:41.627,"Eliza, you're magnificent."
02:42:41.961,02:42:48.467,"Five minutes ago, you were a millstone around my neck, and now you're a tower of strength. A consort battleship."
02:42:49.760,02:42:51.428,I like you this way.
02:42:53.514,02:42:57.226,"Goodbye, Professor Higgins. You shall not be seeing me again."
02:43:11.073,02:43:12.241,Mother!
02:43:13.534,02:43:14.660,Mother!
02:43:15.369,02:43:17.538,"What is it, Henry? What's happened?"
02:43:19.373,02:43:20.332,She's gone.
02:43:20.666,02:43:22.793,"Well, of course, dear. What did you expect?"
02:43:24.336,02:43:29.258,"Well… -what am I to do? -Do without her, I suppose."
02:43:31.385,02:43:33.429,And so I shall.
02:43:36.390,02:43:42.021,"If the Higgins' oxygen burns up her little lungs, let her seek some stuffiness that suits her."
02:43:43.063,02:43:46.859,"She's an owl, sickened by a few days of my sunshine."
02:43:47.067,02:43:48.902,"Very well, let her go. I can do without her."
02:43:48.986,02:43:51.155,I can do without anyone. I have my own soul.
02:43:51.530,02:43:54.450,My own spark of divine fire.
02:43:58.704,02:43:59.788,"Bravo, Eliza."
02:45:23.580,02:45:26.667,Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea.
02:45:26.750,02:45:29.169,"What a heartless, wicked, brainless thing to do."
02:45:30.129,02:45:33.215,But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.
02:45:33.590,02:45:36.385,It's doomed before they even take the vow.
02:47:25.285,02:47:28.455,Marry Freddy. Ha!
02:50:05.028,02:50:08.073,"'E ain't above giving lessons, not 'im. I 'eard 'im say so."
02:50:08.448,02:50:13.453,"Well, I ain't come 'ere to ask for any compliment and if my money's not good enough, I can go elsewhere."
02:50:16.873,02:50:18.083,"Now you know, don't you?"
02:50:18.250,02:50:21.586,"I'm come to have lessons, I am, and to pay for 'em too, make no mistake."
02:50:23.463,02:50:29.219,I want to be a lady in a flower shop instead of sellin' at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.
