00:01:45.606,00:01:46.857,First point of attack.
00:01:49.026,00:01:51.653,"Two, throat. Paralyze vocal cords. Stop screaming."
00:01:52.863,00:01:55.824,"Three, got to be heavy drinker. Floating rib to the liver."
00:01:56.450,00:01:59.369,"Four, finally, dragging left leg. Fist to patella."
00:02:00.871,00:02:03.040,"Summary of prognosis, conscious in 90 seconds."
00:02:03.206,00:02:04.916,"Martial efficacy, quarter of an hour."
00:02:05.083,00:02:07.669,"Full faculty recovery, unlikely."
00:03:20.784,00:03:22.244,I like the hat.
00:03:22.411,00:03:23.912,I just picked it up.
00:03:24.079,00:03:25.831,Did you remember your revolver?
00:03:25.997,00:03:27.249,Knew I forgot something.
00:03:27.916,00:03:30.627,-Thought I'd left the stove on. -You did.
00:03:33.046,00:03:35.090,I think that's quite enough.
00:03:35.298,00:03:37.092,"You are a doctor, after all."
00:03:42.723,00:03:44.808,"Always nice to see you, Watson."
00:03:47.227,00:03:49.187,Where's the inspector?
00:03:49.396,00:03:51.606,He's getting his troops lined up.
00:03:51.773,00:03:53.108,HOLMES: That could be all day.
00:04:51.583,00:04:52.959,MAN: Sherlock Holmes.
00:04:54.795,00:04:56.463,And his loyal dog.
00:04:57.047,00:04:58.381,"Tell me, doctor..."
00:04:58.548,00:05:01.384,"...as a medical man, have you enjoyed my work?"
00:05:01.885,00:05:04.137,Let me show you how much I've enjoyed it.
00:05:04.888,00:05:06.473,HOLMES: Watson. Don't.
00:05:10.644,00:05:12.354,Observe.
00:05:15.232,00:05:17.108,How did you see that?
00:05:17.400,00:05:18.652,Because I was looking for it.
00:05:23.657,00:05:25.575,WATSON: Lord Blackwood.
00:05:26.660,00:05:27.911,You seem surprised.
00:05:28.662,00:05:31.581,I'd say the girl deserves your attention more than he.
00:05:32.749,00:05:34.543,Indeed.
00:05:39.714,00:05:42.425,"Oh, I'd leave that alone if I were you, boy-o."
00:05:42.926,00:05:44.594,Good lad.
00:05:44.886,00:05:47.013,"Impeccable timing, Lestrade."
00:05:48.181,00:05:49.766,We've one for the doctor...
00:05:49.933,00:05:51.434,...and one for the rope.
00:05:51.935,00:05:53.395,-Clarkie? -Sir?
00:05:53.562,00:05:55.438,This woman needs a hospital immediately.
00:05:55.605,00:05:57.232,Put her in the back of the Moriah.
00:05:57.399,00:05:58.608,"POLICEMAN 1: Right, lads. That's it."
00:06:01.862,00:06:04.739,"POLICEMAN 2: Right. Pick him up, lads. POLICEMAN 3: Yes, sir."
00:06:04.906,00:06:06.825,If you don't mind.
00:06:08.451,00:06:09.744,Get him out of my sight.
00:06:15.374,00:06:17.460,And you were supposed to wait for my orders.
00:06:18.795,00:06:22.883,"If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor."
00:06:23.049,00:06:25.969,"Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard."
00:06:26.136,00:06:28.972,Why they thought you'd require any assistance is beyond me.
00:06:29.139,00:06:31.808,"Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief."
00:06:31.975,00:06:34.144,"Indeed. Congratulations, Lestrade."
00:06:34.311,00:06:36.980,"Bravo, inspector. Have a cigar."
00:06:37.147,00:06:38.481,MAN: Gentlemen.
00:06:38.648,00:06:39.858,Cheese.
00:07:08.803,00:07:11.681,MAN 1: Blackwood hangs tomorrow. Read all about it.
00:07:15.769,00:07:19.689,WATSON: 156 over 80. Very good.
00:07:19.856,00:07:23.318,"MAN 2: My nerves are the best they've been in years, thanks to you."
00:07:23.485,00:07:24.903,Tell me something.
00:07:25.070,00:07:27.072,Your new premises...
00:07:27.238,00:07:28.490,...when are you moving in?
00:07:28.657,00:07:30.492,I should be in within the week.
00:07:30.659,00:07:34.037,Cavendish Place. And there'll be a woman's touch too.
00:07:34.204,00:07:35.538,"-Well, that's marvelous. -Indeed."
00:07:37.374,00:07:39.250,Good God.
00:07:40.335,00:07:42.337,-That was gunfire. -No.
00:07:42.504,00:07:45.590,"No, no. Hammer and nail, wasn't it?"
00:07:45.757,00:07:49.010,My colleague's probably just putting up a painting.
00:07:49.177,00:07:51.388,I'll-- I'll go and check.
00:07:51.554,00:07:53.515,-Your colleague-- -Yes?
00:07:53.682,00:07:56.059,"Won't be moving with you, will he?"
00:07:56.393,00:07:58.353,"No, he won't."
00:08:00.730,00:08:02.107,Mrs. Hudson.
00:08:02.273,00:08:04.859,"I won't go in, not while he's got a gun in his hand."
00:08:05.026,00:08:06.736,You don't have to. Give me the paper.
00:08:06.903,00:08:10.490,"What'll I do when you leave, doctor? He'll have the whole house down."
00:08:10.657,00:08:12.534,He just needs another case. That's all.
00:08:12.701,00:08:14.786,Couldn't you have a longer engagement?
00:08:14.953,00:08:18.373,"I smell gunpowder. It's not right, you know, not in a domestic environment."
00:08:20.083,00:08:23.044,"Thank you, Captain Philips. Perhaps a nice cup of tea?"
00:08:23.962,00:08:26.840,"-Same time next week. HUDSON: Come along, captain."
00:08:27.007,00:08:29.259,-It's quieter downstairs. -Mrs. Hudson?
00:08:29.426,00:08:30.927,Bring something to cheer him up.
00:08:40.979,00:08:43.398,Permission to enter the armory?
00:08:43.565,00:08:44.607,HOLMES: Granted.
00:08:47.027,00:08:50.530,"Watson, I am in the process of inventing a device..."
00:08:50.697,00:08:52.699,...that suppresses the sound of a gunshot.
00:08:56.119,00:08:58.038,WATSON: It's not working.
00:08:58.204,00:08:59.831,Can I see that?
00:09:07.797,00:09:10.133,"You know, it's been three months..."
00:09:10.300,00:09:12.594,...since your last case.
00:09:15.138,00:09:23.229,"HOLMES: Yes, yes. Gently, gently, Watson. Be gentle with me-- Don't you think it's time you found another one?"
00:09:25.273,00:09:26.649,I can't but agree.
00:09:26.816,00:09:30.403,My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems. Give me work.
00:09:30.570,00:09:32.197,"The sooner, the better."
00:09:32.781,00:09:34.115,Paper.
00:09:35.241,00:09:37.994,"Let's see, then. There's a letter here..."
00:09:38.161,00:09:41.456,...from Mrs. Ramsey of Queen's Park.
00:09:41.623,00:09:45.168,-Her husband's disappeared. -He's in Belgium with the scullery maid.
00:09:45.335,00:09:46.961,Is it November?
00:09:47.545,00:09:49.756,"Yes, Holmes. All right."
00:09:49.923,00:09:52.717,Lady Radford reports....
00:09:52.884,00:09:55.095,"Oh, her emerald bracelet has disappeared."
00:09:55.261,00:09:59.557,Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast women and slow ponies.
00:09:59.724,00:10:03.436,Oh. I see you're the attending physician at Blackwood's hanging.
00:10:03.603,00:10:04.646,Yes.
00:10:04.813,00:10:08.399,It was our last case together and I wanted to see it through to the end.
00:10:15.073,00:10:16.741,A Mr. Lewis is seeking....
00:10:16.908,00:10:23.873,"There's only one case that intrigues me at present: The curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady."
00:10:24.040,00:10:26.084,I've been studying her comings and goings.
00:10:26.251,00:10:28.378,They appear most sinister.
00:10:28.962,00:10:30.213,"Tea, Mr. Holmes?"
00:10:30.380,00:10:31.673,"Is it poisoned, nanny?"
00:10:32.257,00:10:34.175,There's enough of that in you already.
00:10:34.342,00:10:36.886,Don't touch. Everything is in its proper place...
00:10:37.053,00:10:39.389,"...as per usual, nanny."
00:10:40.557,00:10:42.725,He's killed the dog. Again.
00:10:42.892,00:10:45.270,WATSON: What have you done to Gladstone now?
00:10:45.436,00:10:48.565,I was simply testing a new anesthetic.
00:10:48.731,00:10:50.400,He doesn't mind.
00:10:52.402,00:10:54.654,"Holmes, as your doctor...."
00:10:54.821,00:10:59.033,-He'll be as right as a trivet in no time. -As your friend...
00:10:59.200,00:11:03.246,"...you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist, you have to get out."
00:11:03.413,00:11:07.500,"There's nothing of interest for me out there, on earth, at all."
00:11:09.419,00:11:11.254,-You're free this evening? -Absolutely.
00:11:11.421,00:11:13.672,-Dinner? The Royale? -Wonderful. My favorite.
00:11:14.090,00:11:15.383,Mary's coming.
00:11:16.801,00:11:19.470,"-Not available. -You're meeting her, Holmes."
00:11:21.181,00:11:22.515,Have you proposed yet?
00:11:23.433,00:11:26.728,"-No, I haven't found the right ring. -Then it's not official."
00:11:26.895,00:11:29.022,"It's happening, whether you like it or not."
00:11:29.189,00:11:31.274,"8:30, the Royale. Wear a jacket."
00:11:31.441,00:11:32.984,You wear a jacket.
00:11:46.915,00:11:49.375,A man? Outside my house?
00:11:55.965,00:11:57.884,Straighten your tie.
00:12:08.519,00:12:10.647,WATSON: Holmes. -Mm.
00:12:11.439,00:12:12.774,You're early.
00:12:14.108,00:12:15.652,Fashionably.
00:12:15.818,00:12:17.820,Miss Mary Morstan.
00:12:17.987,00:12:20.323,My goodness. What a pleasure.
00:12:20.739,00:12:24.118,I don't know why it's taken him so long to introduce us properly.
00:12:24.285,00:12:25.662,Pleasure is mine.
00:12:30.583,00:12:33.920,"It really is quite a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes."
00:12:34.087,00:12:36.047,I've heard so much about you.
00:12:36.422,00:12:38.549,I have a pile of detective novels at home.
00:12:38.716,00:12:40.927,"-Wilkie Collins, Poe. -It's true."
00:12:41.094,00:12:43.596,It can seem a little far-fetched though sometimes...
00:12:44.013,00:12:46.516,...making grand assumptions out of tiny details.
00:12:46.683,00:12:48.476,"That's not quite right, is it?"
00:12:48.726,00:12:51.604,"In fact, the little details are by far the most important."
00:12:55.692,00:12:57.485,-Take Watson. -I intend to.
00:13:00.571,00:13:03.074,See his walking stick? A rare African snakewood...
00:13:03.241,00:13:05.702,...hiding a blade of high-tensile steel.
00:13:06.995,00:13:09.330,A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war...
00:13:09.497,00:13:11.541,...so I can assume he's a decorated soldier.
00:13:11.708,00:13:14.711,"Strong, brave, born to be a man of action."
00:13:14.877,00:13:17.547,"And neat, like all military men."
00:13:17.714,00:13:20.675,"Now, I check his pockets."
00:13:21.509,00:13:26.222,Ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer that he's a bit of a gambler.
00:13:26.389,00:13:28.057,I'd keep an eye on that dowry.
00:13:28.224,00:13:30.560,-Those days are behind me. -Right behind you.
00:13:30.727,00:13:32.562,He's cost us the rent more than once.
00:13:32.979,00:13:36.399,"Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know John very well."
00:13:36.566,00:13:39.068,What about a complete stranger?
00:13:39.944,00:13:41.988,-What can you tell about me? -You?
00:13:42.155,00:13:45.033,-I don't think-- -I don't know that-- -Not at dinner. -Some other time.
00:13:45.199,00:13:46.326,-I insist. -You insist?
00:13:46.492,00:13:49.579,-You remember we discussed this. -The lady insists.
00:13:55.960,00:13:57.462,-You're a governess. -Well done.
00:13:57.628,00:13:59.255,"Yes, well done. Shall we...?"
00:13:59.422,00:14:01.716,-Waiter? -Your student...
00:14:01.883,00:14:03.217,...is a boy of 8.
00:14:03.384,00:14:06.262,"-Charlie's 7, actually. HOLMES: Charlie, huh?"
00:14:06.429,00:14:09.265,Then he's tall for his age. He flicked ink at you today.
00:14:09.807,00:14:11.017,Is there ink on my face?
00:14:11.184,00:14:13.102,There's nothing wrong with your face.
00:14:13.269,00:14:15.229,"There are two drops on your ear, in fact."
00:14:15.396,00:14:17.565,India blue's nearly impossible to wash off.
00:14:17.732,00:14:19.359,A very impetuous act by the boy.
00:14:19.525,00:14:21.652,But you're too experienced to react rashly...
00:14:21.819,00:14:24.614,...which is why the lady for whom you work lent you that.
00:14:25.031,00:14:29.285,"Oriental pearls, diamonds, a flawless ruby. Hardly the gems of a governess."
00:14:33.122,00:14:35.291,The jewels you are not wearing tell us more.
00:14:35.458,00:14:37.794,-Holmes. -You were engaged.
00:14:37.960,00:14:40.421,"The ring is gone, but the lighter skin suggests..."
00:14:40.588,00:14:43.299,...that you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly...
00:14:43.466,00:14:45.968,"...until you were informed of its true, modest worth."
00:14:46.135,00:14:47.804,You broke off the engagement...
00:14:47.970,00:14:50.807,...and returned to England for better prospects.
00:14:51.432,00:14:53.601,"A doctor, perhaps."
00:14:59.232,00:15:02.235,"Right on all counts, Mr. Holmes, apart from one."
00:15:05.196,00:15:07.156,I didn't leave him.
00:15:07.490,00:15:08.991,He died.
00:15:18.876,00:15:20.503,"Well done, old boy."
00:15:56.998,00:15:59.125,-Fight. Fight. -Get him.
00:16:34.577,00:16:36.245,McMURDO: Get up and fight.
00:16:39.248,00:16:40.541,Fight.
00:16:40.708,00:16:42.210,-Finish it. McMURDO: Come on.
00:16:48.257,00:16:50.384,"Get up and fight, come on."
00:16:50.968,00:16:52.595,Come on.
00:16:53.846,00:16:55.181,Get up.
00:16:57.475,00:16:59.519,MAN 1: Get up and fight.
00:17:05.942,00:17:08.236,"That's it, big man, we're done."
00:17:08.611,00:17:10.321,"You won, congratulations."
00:17:11.155,00:17:12.406,We ain't done yet.
00:17:17.787,00:17:20.456,HOLMES: This mustn't register on an emotional level.
00:17:21.624,00:17:23.292,"First, distract target."
00:17:24.544,00:17:26.254,Then block his blind jab.
00:17:26.796,00:17:29.298,Counter with cross to left cheek.
00:17:30.758,00:17:32.635,Discombobulate.
00:17:32.802,00:17:34.679,"Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker."
00:17:34.845,00:17:37.974,"Employ elbow block, and body shot."
00:17:39.267,00:17:41.477,Block feral left. Weaken right jaw.
00:17:43.479,00:17:45.106,Now fracture.
00:17:46.774,00:17:48.484,Break cracked ribs.
00:17:48.943,00:17:50.319,Traumatize solar plexus.
00:17:50.903,00:17:52.280,Dislocate jaw entirely.
00:17:55.992,00:17:57.493,Heel kick to diaphragm.
00:17:59.537,00:18:03.958,"In summary, ears ringing, jaw fractured, three ribs cracked, four broken..."
00:18:04.125,00:18:06.919,"...diaphragm hemorrhaging, physical recovery, six weeks..."
00:18:07.587,00:18:09.922,"...full psychological recovery, six months..."
00:18:10.089,00:18:12.174,...capacity to spit at back of head...
00:18:12.341,00:18:14.051,...neutralized.
00:18:41.912,00:18:44.081,MAN 2: Where did that come from?
00:19:23.245,00:19:25.414,"MAN: What the hell's going on here, Charlie?"
00:19:25.581,00:19:28.125,"Lord Blackwood's put him under some kind of spell, sir."
00:19:28.292,00:19:31.045,It's like he's burning from the inside out.
00:19:33.714,00:19:36.425,"You lot, shut up!"
00:19:36.801,00:19:38.427,Charlie. Charlie!
00:19:38.928,00:19:40.721,"Take this man to the infirmary, now."
00:19:53.442,00:19:55.611,"What's this all about, then, Blackwood?"
00:19:59.949,00:20:01.951,There's someone I want to see.
00:20:22.471,00:20:24.640,-Watson? WATSON: Right.
00:20:24.807,00:20:26.475,Let's go.
00:20:27.101,00:20:29.061,What started merely as an experiment...
00:20:29.228,00:20:32.148,...has brought me to the threshold of a monumental discovery.
00:20:32.440,00:20:35.276,"Now, if I play a chromatic scale..."
00:20:35.901,00:20:37.737,...there's no measurable response.
00:20:37.903,00:20:40.656,You do know what you're drinking is meant for eye surgery?
00:20:40.823,00:20:42.158,"But, now..."
00:20:42.324,00:20:43.659,...and this is remarkable...
00:20:43.826,00:20:47.455,...if I change to atonal clusters...
00:20:48.497,00:20:52.960,"...voilà, they fly in counterclockwise, synchronized concentric circles..."
00:20:53.127,00:20:54.712,...as though a regimented flock.
00:20:54.879,00:20:56.505,"Watson, this is exceptional."
00:20:56.672,00:21:01.469,"I, using musical theory, have created order out of chaos."
00:21:03.012,00:21:04.263,How did you lure them in?
00:21:04.722,00:21:06.140,Excellent question.
00:21:06.307,00:21:09.185,Individually. I've been at it for six hours.
00:21:09.935,00:21:12.021,-And what happens if I do this? -What?
00:21:15.316,00:21:16.692,-Right. -Clean yourself up.
00:21:17.359,00:21:19.320,You are Blackwood's last request.
00:21:31.707,00:21:33.793,Look at those towering structures.
00:21:34.543,00:21:38.255,It's the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge ever attempted.
00:21:38.422,00:21:40.341,Most innovative.
00:21:43.135,00:21:44.720,What an industrious empire.
00:21:44.887,00:21:46.680,Hm?
00:21:46.847,00:21:49.391,"Oh, I have your winnings from last night."
00:21:50.768,00:21:53.604,"You weren't there, so I made your customary bet."
00:21:55.397,00:21:59.485,"Right. I'll keep it with your checkbook, locked safely away in my drawer."
00:22:01.570,00:22:04.323,Did you know the opera house is featuring Don Giovanni?
00:22:04.490,00:22:09.078,I could procure a couple of tickets if you had any cultural inclinations this evening.
00:22:12.331,00:22:14.583,"You have the grand gift of silence, Watson."
00:22:14.750,00:22:17.378,It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.
00:22:19.755,00:22:22.132,I knew she'd been engaged.
00:22:22.299,00:22:23.425,She had told me.
00:22:23.592,00:22:25.261,"So that's no to the opera, then?"
00:22:31.976,00:22:35.062,-That was my waistcoat. -We agreed it's too small for you.
00:22:35.229,00:22:36.730,-I'd like it back. -We agreed.
00:22:36.897,00:22:38.399,I want it back.
00:23:11.307,00:23:13.309,"This way, Mr. Holmes."
00:23:14.643,00:23:18.439,Blackwood certainly seems to have got the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.
00:23:18.647,00:23:22.067,Which I'm certain will disperse once his feet have stopped twitching.
00:23:22.234,00:23:23.736,Care to come along?
00:23:23.903,00:23:27.197,"No, old cock. I've no business with him whilst he's alive."
00:23:27.364,00:23:29.658,"Suit yourself, mother hen."
00:23:41.503,00:23:44.757,It seems you have lots of rooms to let.
00:23:44.924,00:23:48.719,"We had to move the prisoners, sir. Otherwise we were gonna have a riot."
00:23:48.886,00:23:52.181,He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.
00:23:52.348,00:23:53.933,As though...
00:23:55.017,00:23:57.435,...he can get inside their heads.
00:24:00.522,00:24:03.441,I can find my own way if you have other duties to perform.
00:24:03.609,00:24:06.362,"Much obliged, sir. Thank you, sir."
00:24:07.196,00:24:11.033,"BLACKWOOD: If any man have an ear, let him hear."
00:24:11.200,00:24:14.078,I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up...
00:24:14.244,00:24:15.996,...having seven heads and 10 horns.
00:24:16.163,00:24:18.456,Upon his heads were the name of blasphemy.
00:24:18.624,00:24:20.876,"They worshiped the dragon, which gave power."
00:24:21.043,00:24:23.629,"They worshiped, saying, Who is like unto the beast?"
00:24:23.796,00:24:25.673,The beast which I saw was like a leopard.
00:24:25.839,00:24:28.509,"His feet were of a bear, his mouth was of a lion..."
00:24:28.676,00:24:32.304,...and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority.
00:24:32.470,00:24:34.765,I love what you've done with the place.
00:24:36.433,00:24:38.727,So glad you could accept my invitation.
00:24:39.353,00:24:41.939,I just have a small point of concern.
00:24:42.773,00:24:45.526,-How can I help? -I'd followed the murders with interest.
00:24:45.734,00:24:48.529,While my heart went out to the families of the victims...
00:24:48.696,00:24:52.658,...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush.
00:24:52.908,00:24:55.244,"-You're too kind. -However, by comparison..."
00:24:55.411,00:24:59.248,...your work in the crypt was more akin to a finger painting.
00:25:02.584,00:25:05.963,So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot.
00:25:06.130,00:25:08.799,"Either that or, um..."
00:25:08.966,00:25:12.845,...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead and I thought I might keep him company.
00:25:13.012,00:25:16.432,Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly's led to this moment.
00:25:16.598,00:25:20.602,Your error of judgment is to assume that I'm holding the brush at all.
00:25:20.769,00:25:24.314,-I'm merely the channel. -My only wish is that I caught you sooner.
00:25:24.481,00:25:27.276,"You see, five lives might have been spared."
00:25:27.443,00:25:30.446,Mm. Those lives were a necessity.
00:25:30.612,00:25:31.947,Hm.
00:25:32.114,00:25:33.782,Sacrifice.
00:25:34.283,00:25:37.244,Five meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose.
00:25:37.411,00:25:39.830,I wonder if they'd let Watson and me dissect your brain.
00:25:39.997,00:25:41.749,"After you're hanged, of course."
00:25:43.292,00:25:46.754,I'd wager there's some deformity that'd be scientifically significant.
00:25:46.920,00:25:50.548,"Then you, too, could serve a greater purpose."
00:25:51.133,00:25:54.803,"Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze."
00:25:54.970,00:25:59.808,I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.
00:26:00.476,00:26:02.644,You and I are bound together on a journey...
00:26:02.811,00:26:05.397,...that will twist the very fabric of nature.
00:26:05.939,00:26:10.027,"But beneath your mask of logic, I sense a fragility."
00:26:10.402,00:26:12.279,That worries me.
00:26:13.113,00:26:15.783,"Steel your mind, Holmes."
00:26:16.408,00:26:17.451,I need you.
00:26:17.618,00:26:20.037,You've come a long way down from the House of Lords.
00:26:20.204,00:26:21.789,-And I will rise again. -Bon voyage.
00:26:21.955,00:26:23.624,Pay attention.
00:26:23.791,00:26:27.127,"Three more will die, and there is nothing you can do to save them."
00:26:27.294,00:26:30.339,You must accept that this is beyond your control...
00:26:30.506,00:26:34.051,"...or, by the time you realize you made all of this possible..."
00:26:34.218,00:26:37.471,...it'll be the last sane thought in your head.
00:26:45.062,00:26:46.563,What did he want?
00:26:46.730,00:26:48.315,Not sure.
00:26:48.482,00:26:51.443,"But I don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one."
00:26:53.237,00:26:55.197,MAN: Lord Henry Blackwood...
00:26:55.364,00:26:59.785,...you are sentenced to death for the practice of black magic...
00:27:00.202,00:27:03.288,...the unholy murder of five innocent young women...
00:27:03.455,00:27:05.874,...and the attempted murder of a sixth.
00:27:06.583,00:27:08.544,Do you have any final words?
00:27:09.545,00:27:11.171,Death...
00:27:12.214,00:27:14.383,...is only the beginning.
00:27:25.561,00:27:27.645,PRIEST: --forever and ever. Amen.
00:27:48.917,00:27:52.254,That is the end of Lord Blackwood.
00:28:13.609,00:28:16.612,ADLER: London's so bleak this time of year.
00:28:17.446,00:28:20.449,Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.
00:28:20.616,00:28:23.118,I much prefer to travel in the winter.
00:28:25.454,00:28:28.749,"Here, I brought you these, all the way from Syria."
00:28:28.916,00:28:31.793,I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...
00:28:31.960,00:28:33.962,...and your favorite...
00:28:34.129,00:28:36.506,...olives from the Cyclades.
00:28:36.673,00:28:38.926,Thought we might have a little tea party.
00:28:39.092,00:28:44.806,"And while I was setting the table, I found this: A file with my name on it."
00:28:45.641,00:28:47.976,Theft of Velázquez portrait from king of Spain.
00:28:48.977,00:28:52.981,Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister.
00:28:54.483,00:28:58.153,Scandalous affair ends engagement of...
00:29:01.615,00:29:03.742,...Hapsburg prince to Romanov princess.
00:29:05.327,00:29:07.829,I was simply studying your methods...
00:29:07.996,00:29:09.957,...should the authorities ask me to hunt you down.
00:29:10.123,00:29:11.667,Ah.
00:29:11.833,00:29:14.002,But I don't see my name in any of these articles.
00:29:14.169,00:29:15.963,But your signature was clear.
00:29:17.589,00:29:19.591,Is that the maharajah's missing diamond?
00:29:21.343,00:29:22.970,Or just another souvenir?
00:29:23.595,00:29:25.681,Let's not dwell on the past.
00:29:27.182,00:29:28.892,Shall we?
00:29:31.103,00:29:33.188,"By the looks of things, you're between jobs."
00:29:33.355,00:29:36.608,And you between husbands. How much did you get for the ring?
00:29:37.025,00:29:40.696,"He was boring and jealous, and he snored."
00:29:43.699,00:29:45.492,I'm Irene Adler again.
00:29:52.833,00:29:54.334,Thank you.
00:30:00.465,00:30:01.883,I need your help.
00:30:02.634,00:30:04.845,I need you to find someone.
00:30:07.306,00:30:08.890,Why are you always so suspicious?
00:30:09.057,00:30:11.560,Shall I answer chronologically or alphabetically?
00:30:11.727,00:30:15.731,Careful not to cut yourself on this lethal envelope.
00:30:18.650,00:30:21.695,I think you'll find all the information you need inside.
00:30:22.988,00:30:24.698,Who are you working for?
00:30:26.241,00:30:28.076,So I'll have to find out the hard way?
00:30:29.244,00:30:31.580,Keep your money. I didn't say I'll take the case.
00:30:31.747,00:30:34.249,"Well, consider it a wager that you will."
00:30:35.125,00:30:37.377,Do you remember The Grand?
00:30:37.544,00:30:39.755,They gave me our old room.
00:30:53.185,00:30:54.519,Hold the door.
00:30:54.686,00:30:56.563,"Thanks, doctor."
00:31:19.127,00:31:20.629,Ma'am.
00:31:24.299,00:31:27.511,"-He'll do it. MAN 1: Well done, Miss Adler."
00:31:28.428,00:31:30.430,That's precisely why I hired you.
00:31:31.598,00:31:34.184,I wager he'll have our man within the next 24 hours.
00:31:34.351,00:31:35.936,MAN 1: He'd better.
00:31:36.103,00:31:38.313,Reordan is the key to what Blackwood was doing.
00:31:39.398,00:31:41.149,He's essential to my plan.
00:31:41.316,00:31:43.485,MAN 2: Get off out of it.
00:31:43.652,00:31:46.279,MAN 3: What you doing? Can't you see where you're going?
00:31:46.446,00:31:48.448,-You scalp diver. -Get off out of it.
00:31:49.491,00:31:52.160,"A little rifle range would go a long way, sir..."
00:31:52.327,00:31:55.705,...rubbing the calluses off these German bands.
00:31:56.456,00:31:57.791,God save the queen.
00:31:58.959,00:32:00.252,"God save the queen, sir."
00:32:00.419,00:32:01.753,MAN 2: Get off out of it.
00:32:05.882,00:32:07.217,Look at you.
00:32:07.843,00:32:10.429,Why is the only woman you've cared about a criminal?
00:32:10.595,00:32:11.638,Are you a masochist?
00:32:11.805,00:32:13.890,-Allow me to explain. -Allow me.
00:32:14.057,00:32:17.853,She's the only adversary who ever outsmarted you. Twice.
00:32:18.019,00:32:19.688,Made a proper idiot out of you.
00:32:19.855,00:32:22.482,"-Right, you've had your fun. -What's she after, anyway?"
00:32:22.649,00:32:25.110,-It's time to press on. -What could she possibly need?
00:32:25.277,00:32:26.695,It doesn't matter.
00:32:26.862,00:32:29.990,An alibi? A beard? A human canoe.
00:32:30.157,00:32:32.993,She could sit on your back and paddle you up the Thames.
00:32:33.160,00:32:35.245,"That's of no consequence to you, is it?"
00:32:35.412,00:32:37.372,We've done our last case together.
00:32:37.539,00:32:39.124,WATSON: I've already read it.
00:32:40.000,00:32:45.172,"Missing person: Luke Reordan, 4 foot 10, red hair, no front teeth."
00:32:45.338,00:32:46.381,Case solved.
00:32:46.548,00:32:49.843,You're obviously not her type. She likes ginger dwarves.
00:32:50.010,00:32:51.636,-Midget. -So you agree?
00:32:51.803,00:32:53.054,"No, I don't agree."
00:32:53.221,00:32:55.807,"It's more than technicality, you see."
00:32:55.974,00:32:59.060,You're misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened peoples.
00:32:59.227,00:33:04.399,"-I've said too much. I've upset you. -No, I am simply stating that one has-- What were you doing?"
00:33:04.566,00:33:07.194,-Will you allow me to explain? -I wish you would.
00:33:30.425,00:33:33.261,-Holmes. What are you doing? -Nothing.
00:33:33.470,00:33:36.097,-Are you wearing a false--? -False nose? No.
00:33:36.348,00:33:38.683,-Tell me that that wasn't.... -That wasn't.
00:33:40.227,00:33:42.687,WATSON: Holmes. Where are you going?
00:33:46.608,00:33:48.109,HOLMES: Watson.
00:33:50.195,00:33:51.530,Watson.
00:34:10.465,00:34:14.386,"Got some flowers for you, sweetheart. Cut you a deal because you're so pretty."
00:34:14.553,00:34:18.431,Oh. My lucky day.
00:34:19.182,00:34:21.476,"Hello, gorgeous. You got something for me?"
00:34:25.230,00:34:26.940,Don't move.
00:34:30.902,00:34:31.987,"Now, what have we got here?"
00:34:33.321,00:34:39.536,It's-- Thank you.
00:34:40.412,00:34:42.622,That's the Irene I know.
00:34:50.171,00:34:51.339,WOMAN: Good boy.
00:35:34.716,00:35:37.177,"This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge."
00:35:37.344,00:35:39.721,-Which is no mean feat. -She's intimidated.
00:35:39.888,00:35:41.056,She's scared of him.
00:35:41.222,00:35:42.390,Yet she works for him.
00:35:44.100,00:35:45.935,-Right. -It's nothing to do with me...
00:35:46.102,00:35:48.855,...but I advise you leave the case alone.
00:35:49.022,00:35:50.565,"Well, I may not have a choice."
00:35:51.775,00:35:54.861,"After all, I may be paying the rent on my own soon, thanks to you."
00:35:55.403,00:35:57.906,-Get that out of my face. -It's not. It's in my hand.
00:35:58.073,00:35:59.407,Get what's in your hand out of my face.
00:35:59.574,00:36:00.867,CLARK: Mr. Holmes? -Clarkie.
00:36:01.743,00:36:04.162,"Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me at once."
00:36:04.329,00:36:06.998,"What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard?"
00:36:07.165,00:36:09.250,"Watson, grab a compass. You means us."
00:36:09.417,00:36:10.919,"No, you means you."
00:36:11.086,00:36:13.505,"CLARK: It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh...."
00:36:13.672,00:36:15.006,Well...
00:36:15.423,00:36:18.468,"...it appears he's come back from the grave, sir."
00:36:26.226,00:36:29.229,-Most engaging. -Very clever.
00:36:29.396,00:36:31.272,I pronounced the man dead myself.
00:36:33.233,00:36:34.693,What are the facts?
00:36:34.859,00:36:38.113,Groundskeeper saw him walking through the graveyard this morning.
00:36:38.738,00:36:40.990,I'll leave this in your capable hands.
00:36:41.533,00:36:45.745,-I have an appointment with Mary. -It's not my reputation that's at stake here.
00:36:45.912,00:36:47.455,Don't try that.
00:36:47.622,00:36:50.875,-The newspapers got wind of it? -That's what we're trying to avoid.
00:36:51.042,00:36:52.627,Certainly.
00:36:52.919,00:36:54.254,What's the major concern?
00:36:54.421,00:36:56.881,"Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir."
00:36:57.048,00:36:59.926,"-Indeed. -You're not taking this seriously, are you?"
00:37:00.093,00:37:01.594,"Yes, as you should."
00:37:03.555,00:37:05.640,It's a matter of professional integrity.
00:37:05.807,00:37:09.769,No girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.
00:37:25.827,00:37:28.121,"Who do you think won the match, Clarkie?"
00:37:28.288,00:37:30.707,-Sir? -The rugby match.
00:37:31.332,00:37:35.003,Your boys have done a magnificent job obliterating any potential evidence.
00:37:35.170,00:37:39.174,Yes. But at least they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
00:37:42.177,00:37:44.179,"LESTRADE: You took your time, Holmes."
00:37:44.345,00:37:47.515,HOLMES: And on the third day....
00:37:49.684,00:37:52.312,These slabs are half a ton each if they're a pound...
00:37:52.479,00:37:54.564,...and they're smashed open from the inside.
00:37:54.731,00:37:57.358,"Lestrade, what of the coffin?"
00:37:57.525,00:38:00.862,-We are in the process of bringing it up. -I see.
00:38:01.863,00:38:06.117,Hm. Right. At what stage of the process? Contemplative?
00:38:08.703,00:38:10.455,"Anyhow, where's our witness?"
00:38:10.622,00:38:11.915,He's over there.
00:38:12.081,00:38:17.128,"And apparently, he is cata-- Cat-- Catatonic, sir."
00:38:18.046,00:38:20.215,-He's not feeling very well. -Yes.
00:38:22.342,00:38:26.221,"If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering milkmaids, you're on double-time."
00:38:26.387,00:38:29.891,"Now, you get down there and you bring that coffin up now."
00:38:30.058,00:38:32.477,"Good day, sir."
00:38:33.394,00:38:35.063,Hello.
00:38:36.272,00:38:37.816,It's all right.
00:38:37.982,00:38:39.692,I'm a doctor.
00:38:49.869,00:38:52.330,The man's in shock. He may need a few moments.
00:38:53.122,00:38:57.168,The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.
00:38:57.502,00:38:58.795,Well?
00:38:58.962,00:39:02.090,-Well? -You pronounced him dead.
00:39:02.257,00:39:04.759,He had no pulse.
00:39:09.597,00:39:11.099,MAN: Ready.
00:39:11.933,00:39:13.434,Down.
00:39:25.446,00:39:26.948,Good Lord.
00:39:28.616,00:39:30.118,That's not Blackwood.
00:39:31.786,00:39:35.123,"Well, now we have a firm grasp of the obvious."
00:39:39.711,00:39:41.129,Time of death?
00:39:43.298,00:39:45.675,Diptera is...
00:39:46.551,00:39:48.344,...approximately...
00:39:49.095,00:39:52.098,...two thirds of an inch which would put the time of death...
00:39:52.265,00:39:54.309,...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.
00:39:54.976,00:39:56.811,May I borrow your pen?
00:40:01.399,00:40:03.902,-Adler's dwarf. -Midget.
00:40:13.661,00:40:15.121,GROUNDSKEEPER: I know what I saw.
00:40:16.956,00:40:18.333,It was Blackwood.
00:40:19.667,00:40:21.961,As clear as I see you.
00:40:23.755,00:40:26.424,And when the dead walk...
00:40:27.342,00:40:30.178,...the living will fill these coffins.
00:40:32.472,00:40:34.641,"Well, um...."
00:40:38.561,00:40:40.813,LESTRADE: Right. Put the lid on and clean this lot up.
00:40:40.980,00:40:43.024,WATSON: You really believe he was resurrected?
00:40:43.191,00:40:45.193,"HOLMES: The question is not if, but how."
00:40:45.360,00:40:52.784,"-The game's afoot. WATSON: Follow your spirit-- HOLMES &amp; WATSON: And upon this charge, cry: God for Harry, England and St. George."
00:40:55.370,00:40:56.579,There you are.
00:40:56.871,00:40:59.332,Why that certain fish and chips store? I don't understand.
00:40:59.499,00:41:03.711,"There's a particular beer in their batter. A northern stout, to be exact."
00:41:04.045,00:41:07.674,"WATSON: You know, Holmes, I've seen things in war I don't understand."
00:41:07.840,00:41:10.134,I once met a man who predicted his own death...
00:41:10.301,00:41:12.637,...right down to the number and the placement...
00:41:12.804,00:41:15.056,...of the bullets that killed him.
00:41:15.223,00:41:16.808,"You have to admit, Holmes..."
00:41:16.975,00:41:19.602,...that a supernatural explanation to this case...
00:41:19.769,00:41:21.896,...is theoretically possible.
00:41:22.063,00:41:27.068,"Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake to theorize before one has data."
00:41:27.235,00:41:29.988,Inevitably one begins to twist facts to suit theories...
00:41:30.154,00:41:32.365,...instead of theories to suit facts.
00:41:32.532,00:41:36.411,"That said, I believe Adler's midget is the key to this."
00:41:36.577,00:41:37.912,WATSON: Hm.
00:41:38.079,00:41:41.249,HOLMES: Right. Scratches around the keyhole where the watch was wound.
00:41:41.416,00:41:44.043,-What does that tell you? -The man was likely a drunk.
00:41:44.210,00:41:47.588,"Every time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches."
00:41:47.755,00:41:48.798,"Very good, Watson."
00:41:48.965,00:41:52.677,You've developed considerable deductive powers of your own. Hm.
00:41:52.844,00:41:57.306,"Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored-- -Pawnbrokers' marks. -Excellent."
00:41:57.473,00:42:01.769,Most recent of which are M.H. M.H. M.H. is for?
00:42:01.936,00:42:04.480,-Maddison and Haig. -Maddison and Haig.
00:42:08.276,00:42:10.611,They should be able to give us an address.
00:42:14.615,00:42:16.325,What a coincidence.
00:42:17.285,00:42:19.954,There's one thing you've failed to deduce from the watch.
00:42:20.121,00:42:21.539,HOLMES: Really? I think not.
00:42:21.706,00:42:24.917,"WATSON: The time. I have to get back, Holmes."
00:42:25.084,00:42:26.961,Taking tea with the in-laws.
00:42:27.128,00:42:29.422,"-Reckon your future, sir? -Absolutely not."
00:42:29.589,00:42:32.133,"WATSON: No, thank you. -You need to hear what I have to tell."
00:42:32.300,00:42:34.635,"We have no need of your lucky heather, gypsy woman."
00:42:34.802,00:42:37.055,Even if it's to do with Mary?
00:42:42.018,00:42:43.478,Oh. Oh.
00:42:43.644,00:42:46.647,I see two men. Brothers.
00:42:46.814,00:42:48.649,"Not in blood, but in bond."
00:42:52.820,00:42:54.030,What of Mary?
00:42:54.197,00:42:57.992,"M for Mary, for marriage. Oh, you will be married."
00:42:58.993,00:43:00.161,Go on.
00:43:00.495,00:43:03.539,I see patterned tablecloths...
00:43:03.706,00:43:06.167,"...and, oh, china figurines..."
00:43:06.334,00:43:08.294,"...and, oh, lace doilies."
00:43:09.003,00:43:10.004,Doilies.
00:43:10.171,00:43:13.674,Lace doilies? Holmes.
00:43:14.133,00:43:17.136,Does your depravity know no bounds?
00:43:17.303,00:43:19.138,"-No. -Oh, she turns to fat..."
00:43:19.305,00:43:21.140,"...and, oh, she has a beard and...."
00:43:21.307,00:43:23.476,-What of the warts? -She's covered in warts.
00:43:23.643,00:43:25.269,-Enough. -Are they extensive?
00:43:25.436,00:43:27.355,"Please, enough."
00:43:28.731,00:43:31.692,It's the most apt prediction Flora has made in years.
00:43:32.693,00:43:35.238,And precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring.
00:43:35.404,00:43:36.489,Do you have my money?
00:43:36.656,00:43:39.200,You are terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre.
00:43:39.367,00:43:41.452,-Do you have my cut from the fight? -Admit it.
00:43:41.619,00:43:43.704,-Give me my money! Holmes. -Admit it!
00:43:45.540,00:43:47.416,HOLMES: I see.
00:43:53.589,00:43:54.924,Thank you.
00:43:57.093,00:44:00.721,"HOLMES: Well, you've got your ring and I've got my address for the ginger midget."
00:44:00.888,00:44:04.392,-Should be just there. -I think she'll really like this.
00:44:04.559,00:44:08.312,And I have some change in my pocket.
00:44:12.191,00:44:15.236,"-Shall I look after it for you? -No, no."
00:44:16.070,00:44:17.989,-Don't give it away here. -No.
00:44:18.156,00:44:20.158,I have to go see Mary.
00:44:20.408,00:44:22.243,Give her my best.
00:44:23.119,00:44:25.163,"And her family, as well."
00:45:05.119,00:45:07.288,It does make a considerable difference to me...
00:45:07.455,00:45:10.041,...having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely.
00:45:10.208,00:45:13.710,"Well, you can rely on me for exactly 10 minutes."
00:45:15.796,00:45:18.299,He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
00:45:18.466,00:45:20.343,HOLMES: Something did.
00:45:21.302,00:45:23.095,Irene Adler was here.
00:45:23.304,00:45:27.350,Either that or the ginger midget wore the same Parisian perfume.
00:45:30.186,00:45:32.647,Ah. Putrefaction.
00:45:37.276,00:45:40.988,"Ammonium sulfate, among other aromas."
00:45:45.076,00:45:46.827,Phosphorous.
00:45:47.828,00:45:49.497,Formaldehyde.
00:46:01.175,00:46:03.344,It looks like...
00:46:04.178,00:46:06.430,...he was attempting to combine...
00:46:06.597,00:46:09.976,...some kind of sorcery and scientific formula.
00:46:17.942,00:46:19.860,HOLMES: More importantly...
00:46:20.444,00:46:22.989,...let's see what he was trying to dispose of.
00:46:24.198,00:46:26.783,"-Potassium, magnesium. -Sultaphytic acid."
00:46:26.951,00:46:30.913,It'll suck the iron right out of the ink as long as it's not too burnt.
00:46:45.720,00:46:47.221,Peculiar.
00:46:49.640,00:46:51.976,Hydrated rhododendron.
00:47:17.043,00:47:19.253,-Holmes. -Hm?
00:47:19.420,00:47:20.921,Look at the crest.
00:47:22.089,00:47:23.840,Reordan was working with Blackwood.
00:47:24.008,00:47:25.760,Of course he was.
00:47:25.926,00:47:28.220,"The question is, to what end."
00:47:31.682,00:47:35.436,"Whatever he was working on, he clearly succeeded."
00:47:35.603,00:47:36.937,How so?
00:47:37.104,00:47:39.315,"Otherwise, he'd still be alive."
00:47:39.482,00:47:42.109,Which is why Miss Adler is so desperate to find him.
00:47:42.777,00:47:43.778,HOLMES: Yes.
00:47:43.944,00:47:45.946,There is one odor I can't quite put my finger on.
00:47:46.113,00:47:49.450,-Mm? -Is it candy floss? Molasses?
00:47:49.617,00:47:50.993,Maple syrup?
00:47:51.160,00:47:52.286,Barley sugar.
00:47:52.453,00:47:54.205,Toffee apple.
00:47:59.627,00:48:01.295,Let me guess.
00:48:01.462,00:48:03.589,Judging by your arsonist tool kit...
00:48:03.756,00:48:07.718,...you're here to burn down the building and extinguish all evidence therein.
00:48:07.884,00:48:10.137,"Just one minute, boys."
00:48:10.304,00:48:12.098,"Oh, Dredger."
00:48:31.784,00:48:33.119,Meat...
00:48:33.452,00:48:34.662,...or potatoes?
00:48:35.371,00:48:37.039,My 10 minutes are up.
00:49:30.384,00:49:31.886,WATSON: You all right?
00:50:47.753,00:50:49.296,Holmes...
00:50:49.922,00:50:51.257,...what is that?
00:50:53.467,00:54:20.591,DREDGER: HOLMES: HOLMES: HOLMES: WATSON: Holmes!
00:55:16.230,00:55:18.357,...what have you done?
00:55:29.535,00:55:31.327,WATSON: I haven't slept all night.
00:55:31.578,00:55:33.497,Not a wink.
00:55:34.915,00:55:37.333,Why I ever believed...
00:55:37.584,00:55:41.255,...that I would get to have tea with Mary's parents is beyond me...
00:55:41.421,00:55:45.634,-...having been talked into going with you. -We were set upon. It was self-defense.
00:55:45.801,00:55:50.055,I've been reviewing my notes on our exploits over the last seven months.
00:55:50.222,00:55:52.015,Would you like to know my conclusion?
00:55:52.599,00:55:55.519,-I am psychologically disturbed. -How so?
00:55:55.686,00:55:59.857,Why else would I continually be led into situations...
00:56:00.023,00:56:04.611,...where you deliberately withhold your plans from me? Why else?
00:56:05.445,00:56:08.782,You've never complained about my methods before.
00:56:08.949,00:56:11.243,-I'm not complaining. -What do you call this?
00:56:11.410,00:56:13.287,How am I complaining? I never complain.
00:56:13.453,00:56:16.372,Do I complain about you practicing the violin in the morning...
00:56:16.540,00:56:20.752,"...or your mess, your lack of hygiene, or the fact that you steal my clothes?"
00:56:20.919,00:56:22.129,We have a barter system.
00:56:22.296,00:56:24.631,Do I complain about you setting fire to my rooms?
00:56:24.798,00:56:25.841,-Our rooms. -The rooms.
00:56:26.008,00:56:28.635,When do I complain that you experiment on my dog?
00:56:28.802,00:56:29.970,-Our dog. -On the dog.
00:56:30.137,00:56:31.597,Gladstone is our dog.
00:56:31.763,00:56:36.810,Where I do take issue is your campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
00:56:44.484,00:56:45.861,I understand.
00:56:46.028,00:56:47.738,-Do you? -I do.
00:56:48.947,00:56:51.366,-I don't think you do. -You're overtired.
00:56:51.992,00:56:53.493,-Yes. -You're feeling sensitive.
00:56:53.660,00:56:54.828,I'm not sensitive.
00:56:54.995,00:56:57.205,What you need is a rest.
00:56:57.372,00:57:00.042,"My brother, Mycroft, has a small estate near Chichester."
00:57:00.208,00:57:04.630,Beautiful grounds. There's a folly. We can throw a lamb on the spit.
00:57:04.796,00:57:08.592,"We? Holmes, if I were to go to the country, it would be with my future wife."
00:57:08.759,00:57:11.845,"-Well, certainly, if we must-- -No, not you. Mary and I."
00:57:12.012,00:57:13.805,"-You are not-- -What, invited?"
00:57:13.972,00:57:16.600,Why would I not be invited to my brother's country home?
00:57:16.767,00:57:18.310,Now you're not making any sense.
00:57:18.477,00:57:19.519,You're not human.
00:57:19.686,00:57:21.021,MAN: John Watson?
00:57:22.439,00:57:23.565,Yes.
00:57:23.732,00:57:25.525,Your bail's been posted.
00:57:31.448,00:57:32.950,WATSON: Mary.
00:57:36.620,00:57:38.288,Just Watson.
00:57:45.837,00:57:49.549,"I hope you get bail by breakfast, because the boys are getting hungry."
00:57:54.388,00:57:56.056,LESTRADE: Step lively.
00:57:59.851,00:58:01.937,Back off. Back off.
00:58:02.104,00:58:04.564,"To which the barman says, May I push in your stool?"
00:58:08.402,00:58:09.695,"Right, you, you're out."
00:58:10.862,00:58:12.406,"Until next time, Big Joe."
00:58:12.572,00:58:14.950,"Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes."
00:58:16.034,00:58:18.662,Thank heaven you're here. I'd almost run out of jokes.
00:58:18.829,00:58:20.956,"In another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal."
00:58:21.123,00:58:24.501,"And you, sir, an excellent policeman. Tomski, thank you."
00:58:25.627,00:58:27.462,"Now, please tell me you have answers."
00:58:27.629,00:58:29.923,"All in good time, Lestrade."
00:58:30.090,00:58:33.593,All in good time? Is this some parlor game where we guess what you're thinking?
00:58:33.760,00:58:36.972,I've got a public in frenzy out there. If you don't fill me in...
00:58:37.139,00:58:40.976,...I'll have you in there playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookie's runner.
00:58:41.309,00:58:44.271,"Now, clean up and make yourself presentable."
00:58:44.563,00:58:45.772,For whom?
00:58:45.939,00:58:49.651,Friends in high places. They're the ones who bailed you out.
00:59:00.412,00:59:03.707,"I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, sir..."
00:59:03.874,00:59:06.293,...but I'm gonna have to put this on you.
00:59:09.963,00:59:14.468,"Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this."
00:59:14.801,00:59:18.430,I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are and who I am.
00:59:18.680,00:59:19.973,As to where I am...
00:59:20.390,00:59:24.311,"...I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn."
00:59:24.478,00:59:27.606,But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill...
00:59:27.773,00:59:31.318,...the only baker to use a certain French glaze on their loaves...
00:59:31.485,00:59:32.736,...a Brittany sage.
00:59:32.903,00:59:37.657,"The carriage forked left, then right, a telltale bump over the Fleet Conduit."
00:59:37.824,00:59:41.828,"And as to who you are, that took every ounce of my not inconsiderable experience."
00:59:41.995,00:59:45.332,The letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram.
00:59:45.499,00:59:47.918,"Lord Chief Justice, that'd be your official title."
00:59:48.085,00:59:51.671,"Who you really are is, of course, another matter entirely."
00:59:52.297,00:59:54.174,Judging by the sacred ox on your ring...
00:59:54.341,00:59:56.885,...you're the head of the Temple of the Four Orders...
00:59:57.052,00:59:58.845,...in whose headquarters we now sit...
00:59:59.012,01:00:02.182,"...on the northwest corner of St. James's Square, I think."
01:00:02.349,01:00:06.770,"As to the mystery, the only mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me at all."
01:00:09.022,01:00:13.193,"Yes, well, standard procedure, I suppose."
01:00:15.028,01:00:17.364,"I daresay we have the right man, gentlemen."
01:00:17.531,01:00:20.283,"Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish from America..."
01:00:20.450,01:00:22.369,"...and Lord Coward, the home secretary."
01:00:23.078,01:00:26.873,I suppose you already have some notion as to the practices of our order.
01:00:27.541,01:00:29.543,HOLMES: Yes. Um....
01:00:29.709,01:00:32.379,They're practically interesting.
01:00:32.546,01:00:33.964,Be as skeptical as you like.
01:00:34.131,01:00:37.592,But our secret systems have steered the world towards good for centuries.
01:00:37.759,01:00:41.179,The danger is they can also be used for more nefarious purposes.
01:00:41.346,01:00:44.141,"What some call the dark arts, or practical magic."
01:00:44.307,01:00:47.894,"STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic, Mr. Holmes."
01:00:48.061,01:00:50.647,We don't expect you to share our faith...
01:00:50.814,01:00:52.232,...merely our fears.
01:00:52.399,01:00:54.985,Fear is the more infectious condition.
01:00:55.152,01:00:57.154,In this instance...
01:00:59.531,01:01:01.241,...fear of your own child.
01:01:04.536,01:01:06.204,Blackwood is your son.
01:01:06.371,01:01:09.833,"You have the same irises, a rare dark green..."
01:01:10.000,01:01:11.918,...with diamond-shaped hazel flecks...
01:01:12.085,01:01:16.089,"...together with identical outer ears, which are only passed down through bloodline..."
01:01:16.256,01:01:18.300,...which makes you either brothers...
01:01:18.466,01:01:21.219,"...or, in this case, more likely, father and son."
01:01:26.516,01:01:29.686,Very few people are privy to that information...
01:01:29.853,01:01:31.688,...and we want to keep it that way.
01:01:36.484,01:01:38.612,He was conceived during one of our rituals.
01:01:38.778,01:01:40.197,His mother wasn't my wife...
01:01:40.780,01:01:42.616,...but she shared our beliefs.
01:01:42.782,01:01:44.951,She was a powerful practitioner...
01:01:45.118,01:01:47.787,...though not enough to survive giving birth to him.
01:01:49.789,01:01:51.791,Death followed him wherever he went.
01:01:51.958,01:01:54.377,Those five girls were not the first to be butchered.
01:01:54.544,01:01:57.714,"He killed many more, using them to enhance his powers."
01:01:58.298,01:02:01.468,"No one could prove anything, of course, but we all knew."
01:02:02.636,01:02:04.179,The boy was a curse.
01:02:04.346,01:02:07.307,"We've done our best to stop him, but it's not enough."
01:02:07.474,01:02:08.892,His power grows daily.
01:02:09.059,01:02:11.144,His resurrection is evidence of that.
01:02:11.645,01:02:13.813,But what he does next will be more dangerous.
01:02:13.980,01:02:18.485,ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells. This is the source of his power.
01:02:19.069,01:02:21.947,He's gonna raise a force that will alter the course of the world.
01:02:22.113,01:02:24.908,We want you to find him and stop him before he does.
01:02:25.784,01:02:28.703,COWARD: We'll give you any assistance that we can.
01:02:29.829,01:02:33.333,"As home secretary, I have considerable influence over the police."
01:02:33.500,01:02:35.043,"HOLMES: Hm, yes."
01:02:36.795,01:02:38.129,COWARD: So...
01:02:39.965,01:02:41.383,...name your price.
01:02:41.549,01:02:43.760,The benefit of being a consulting detective...
01:02:43.927,01:02:46.012,...is that I can pick and choose my clients.
01:02:46.846,01:02:48.682,"So consider it done, I'll stop him."
01:02:50.308,01:02:52.143,But not for you.
01:02:52.310,01:02:54.271,And certainly not for a price.
01:02:57.607,01:03:01.111,"-I do have a parting query, Sir Thomas. -What is that?"
01:03:01.278,01:03:05.115,"If the rest of his family's dead, how long do you expect to survive?"
01:03:06.533,01:03:07.617,Food for thought.
01:03:32.559,01:03:36.062,"Well, perhaps you'll have better luck opening that."
01:03:36.604,01:03:39.899,Margaux '58. A comet vintage.
01:03:40.483,01:03:47.073,How fascinating that an astronomical event can affect the quality-- How is it going with our case you refuse to take?
01:03:47.240,01:03:48.575,--of the wine.
01:03:49.701,01:03:52.662,"Oh, I've hit a dead end, literally."
01:03:54.205,01:03:55.749,I found your man.
01:03:55.915,01:03:58.251,He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.
01:03:59.127,01:04:00.503,If you still need him.
01:04:02.422,01:04:04.257,"Oh, dear."
01:04:06.217,01:04:09.429,Hope my client doesn't come looking for a refund.
01:04:09.596,01:04:10.930,"He's a professor, isn't he?"
01:04:11.097,01:04:14.017,"Couldn't see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel."
01:04:14.184,01:04:18.438,"I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption."
01:04:22.484,01:04:24.944,"Eye patch, nice touch."
01:04:25.862,01:04:27.947,So case closed...
01:04:28.114,01:04:31.117,...which makes this a social visit.
01:04:31.284,01:04:34.204,"No, it's a you're in over your head, Irene visit."
01:04:34.913,01:04:37.415,Whoever killed Reordan was covering their tracks...
01:04:37.582,01:04:39.793,...which makes you the next loose end to be snipped.
01:04:41.836,01:04:43.505,Let it breathe.
01:04:44.464,01:04:46.591,I've never been in over my head.
01:04:46.758,01:04:50.303,Leave now. Disappear. You're good at that.
01:04:50.470,01:04:54.557,Or stay and volunteer for protective custody.
01:04:57.644,01:05:01.147,"If I'm in danger, so are you."
01:05:04.818,01:05:06.486,Come with me.
01:05:09.114,01:05:10.824,What if we trusted each other?
01:05:11.282,01:05:12.534,Hm?
01:05:12.700,01:05:13.785,You're not listening.
01:05:13.952,01:05:18.540,I'm taking you to either the railway station or the police station.
01:05:30.385,01:05:31.845,So....
01:05:35.181,01:05:37.016,-Which is it to be? -Careful.
01:05:38.893,01:05:40.520,You decide.
01:05:40.687,01:05:43.106,-Which will it be? -What--?
01:05:43.690,01:05:45.567,I told you to let it breathe.
01:05:46.359,01:05:48.528,Can you taste the comet?
01:05:54.576,01:05:57.954,Why couldn't you just come away with me?
01:05:59.289,01:06:01.040,Never.
01:07:47.772,01:07:51.985,"Madam, I need you to remain calm and trust me, I'm a professional."
01:07:52.151,01:07:54.654,But beneath this pillow lies the key to my release.
01:07:55.989,01:07:59.158,"-She misinterpreted my intention entirely. CLARK: Naturally, sir."
01:07:59.325,01:08:02.120,That's why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling.
01:08:02.287,01:08:05.540,"-No latitude for misunderstanding. -Faith runs right over reason, sir."
01:08:05.707,01:08:08.710,Indeed. And chambermaids were once such a liberal breed.
01:08:08.876,01:08:11.170,"My wife's a chambermaid, sir."
01:08:13.298,01:08:17.218,"Anyhow, a good thing she was offended, or we may never have found you."
01:08:17.385,01:08:21.139,"The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning, sir."
01:08:24.934,01:08:27.020,"-Just joking about the wife, sir. -Oh."
01:08:31.566,01:08:33.067,"CLARK: We've checked everything, sir."
01:08:33.234,01:08:36.070,No sign of a break-in and the butler didn't hear a thing.
01:08:36.237,01:08:38.406,So body in the bathtub...
01:08:38.573,01:08:42.827,"...his eyes were wide open, and the only thing missing was..."
01:08:43.828,01:08:45.872,"...his ring, sir."
01:09:02.013,01:09:03.723,Why did you drain the water?
01:09:03.890,01:09:07.560,"-Out of common decency. -Crime is common, logic is rare."
01:09:07.727,01:09:11.731,"The decent thing to do is to catch the killer, not provide comfort for the corpse."
01:09:26.412,01:09:27.914,What is that?
01:09:31.501,01:09:33.419,"-Jasmine bath salts, sir. -Superb."
01:09:33.586,01:09:37.215,Probably comes from a larger container. It'll either be in the pantry...
01:09:37.382,01:09:41.094,"...high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen cupboard with a vent."
01:09:42.095,01:09:43.596,"Constable, you could do worse..."
01:09:43.763,01:09:47.058,...than to check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints.
01:09:47.225,01:09:49.936,"Data, data, data. I cannot make bricks without clay."
01:10:49.245,01:10:50.913,CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
01:10:59.464,01:11:01.716,Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?
01:11:01.883,01:11:03.676,"It was in the pantry, sir."
01:11:04.135,01:11:05.928,I don't know what to make of this.
01:11:06.095,01:11:07.847,Excellent work.
01:11:08.014,01:11:09.766,Adieu.
01:11:47.720,01:11:51.224,"What's the meaning of this, Coward? Why have you called this meeting?"
01:11:52.433,01:11:53.684,Sir Thomas is dead.
01:11:55.895,01:11:58.898,I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the order.
01:12:01.943,01:12:03.945,Have you lost your mind?
01:12:04.111,01:12:06.072,You know damn well what he's capable of.
01:12:06.239,01:12:08.115,BLACKWOOD: Of course he does.
01:12:10.034,01:12:11.869,That's why we're here.
01:12:13.412,01:12:15.081,That's why we're all here.
01:12:21.087,01:12:24.757,My powers and my assets were given to me for one purpose.
01:12:25.132,01:12:29.303,A magnificent but simple purpose.
01:12:30.429,01:12:32.515,To create a new future.
01:12:33.140,01:12:36.602,A future ruled...
01:12:36.769,01:12:38.521,...by us.
01:12:40.481,01:12:45.611,"Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step towards a new chapter in our history."
01:12:47.113,01:12:48.489,Magic will lead the way.
01:12:48.656,01:12:51.117,Once the people of England see our newfound power...
01:12:51.284,01:12:53.202,...they'll bow down in fear.
01:12:58.165,01:13:01.961,Across the Atlantic lies a colony that was once ours.
01:13:02.128,01:13:03.462,It will be again.
01:13:04.380,01:13:06.632,The Civil War has made them weak.
01:13:06.799,01:13:11.637,Their government is as corrupt and as ineffective as ours...
01:13:11.804,01:13:14.015,...so we'll take it back.
01:13:15.641,01:13:18.019,We will remake the world...
01:13:19.729,01:13:21.439,...create the future.
01:13:22.732,01:13:26.485,"These men are with me, Standish..."
01:13:26.652,01:13:28.195,...but...
01:13:28.487,01:13:29.864,...are you?
01:13:30.531,01:13:33.242,"No, sir. I am not."
01:13:34.243,01:13:37.121,These powers that you're playing with...
01:13:37.288,01:13:39.332,...no man can control.
01:13:41.459,01:13:43.252,"Well, gentlemen..."
01:13:44.754,01:13:48.174,"...someone has to stop him, even if you won't."
01:13:50.426,01:13:52.511,"Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
01:13:57.725,01:13:59.727,STANDISH: Save me!
01:14:15.826,01:14:17.495,Gentlemen...
01:14:17.662,01:14:19.538,...don't be afraid.
01:14:20.498,01:14:22.333,As you can see...
01:14:23.584,01:14:25.628,...we are protected.
01:14:26.879,01:14:29.382,"Come, drink your allegiance here."
01:14:35.638,01:14:39.392,"You control the police, now use them."
01:14:51.153,01:14:52.405,Didn't know you were here.
01:14:52.571,01:14:55.825,"Since this room is no longer yours, do you mind if I utilize it?"
01:14:57.201,01:14:58.703,Be my guest.
01:15:00.204,01:15:02.081,"-In here, chaps. MAN: Where would you like me..."
01:15:02.248,01:15:04.667,"-...to put him, sir? -Anywhere is fine."
01:15:15.261,01:15:18.389,WATSON: Who is he? -The man who tried to kill you at Reordan's.
01:15:18.556,01:15:21.434,His neck didn't survive the impact of Dredger landing on him.
01:15:22.101,01:15:23.602,Yes.
01:15:24.270,01:15:26.147,"Thanks for that, by the way."
01:15:28.107,01:15:32.653,There is consolation in the knowledge that he could be of service to his fellow man.
01:15:36.615,01:15:41.287,"Elbows and arms stained with blood, but it's older than his own injuries."
01:15:47.251,01:15:49.295,None of it human.
01:15:50.171,01:15:51.714,"He's not a butcher, let me see."
01:16:01.849,01:16:04.101,"Yellow flame, green bursts."
01:16:04.685,01:16:05.978,An industrial worker.
01:16:09.815,01:16:11.650,Pff. Coal.
01:16:11.817,01:16:13.444,River silt.
01:16:13.611,01:16:15.988,The slag on his trousers should put him squarely in....
01:16:16.155,01:16:18.324,"-Nine Elms. -Sorry, what?"
01:16:18.908,01:16:21.160,The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.
01:16:21.327,01:16:23.162,I wondered.
01:16:23.329,01:16:26.665,Do you remember where I put the Lords Register of members' interests?
01:16:26.832,01:16:28.209,It's on the stepladder.
01:16:38.677,01:16:43.182,"Well, Blackwood's had his hand in just about everything that's corrosive to the spirit."
01:16:43.808,01:16:46.769,Woolwich Arsenal. Limehouse Chemical Works.
01:16:46.936,01:16:48.938,It'll probably be a factory by the river.
01:16:49.355,01:16:50.856,What's that?
01:16:51.273,01:16:52.775,Never mind.
01:16:54.610,01:16:56.862,"You don't know where my rugby ball went, do you?"
01:16:57.029,01:16:58.364,"No, not a clue."
01:16:58.531,01:17:01.492,Queenshithe Slaughterhouse.
01:17:01.659,01:17:03.035,Nine Elms.
01:17:03.202,01:17:05.204,A factory by the river.
01:17:05.579,01:17:08.541,"Well done. That should lead us to Blackwood, dead or alive."
01:17:09.125,01:17:10.793,Not us.
01:17:12.628,01:17:13.963,You.
01:17:14.421,01:17:15.881,Yes.
01:17:17.258,01:17:19.510,"Just a figure of speech, old boy."
01:17:28.602,01:17:29.895,He's left it there on purpose.
01:17:50.416,01:17:52.877,"More coal, doctor."
01:17:57.339,01:18:00.050,That's a good one. He's such a tit.
01:18:00.217,01:18:01.760,"Oh, God. Yeah."
01:18:01.927,01:18:03.762,WATSON: Glad to see you two are working hard.
01:18:03.929,01:18:06.599,And I thought we were trying to be discreet.
01:18:06.765,01:18:10.603,You would not last one day in the navy.
01:18:12.938,01:18:16.859,Are you sure there isn't an alternative means of water transportation than that?
01:18:17.026,01:18:20.613,I guarantee you nobody knows London's waterways better.
01:18:20.863,01:18:24.283,-Tanner's practically a fish himself. -He certainly drinks like one.
01:18:24.450,01:18:26.619,"Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor."
01:18:26.785,01:18:29.038,If only just a sense.
01:18:29.455,01:18:33.375,"I better take over, there. Bit tricky down here."
01:18:54.521,01:18:56.440,"Come on, come on."
01:19:11.747,01:19:13.290,WATSON: Look familiar? HOLMES: Yep.
01:19:13.457,01:19:16.126,All that's missing is a ginger midget.
01:19:28.555,01:19:31.058,They cleared something away from here not minutes ago.
01:19:31.225,01:19:32.810,Like what?
01:19:33.102,01:19:36.188,Not sure. Something mechanical.
01:19:36.355,01:19:37.982,Holmes.
01:19:38.607,01:19:40.359,Look at this.
01:20:04.466,01:20:06.135,-1:18. -Chapter and verse.
01:20:06.302,01:20:10.055,"Revelations 1:18. I am he that liveth, and was dead."
01:20:10.472,01:20:13.475,"BLACKWOOD: And behold, I'm alive for evermore."
01:20:14.601,01:20:18.480,"I warned you, Holmes, to accept that this was beyond your control..."
01:20:18.647,01:20:21.525,...beyond what your rational mind could comprehend.
01:20:23.110,01:20:27.072,-What a busy afterlife you're having. BLACKWOOD: I want you to bear witness.
01:20:27.698,01:20:32.161,"Tomorrow, at midday, the world as you know it will end."
01:20:32.328,01:20:34.747,"Show me your face, it'll be the end of your world."
01:20:34.913,01:20:36.874,"Save your bullets, Watson."
01:20:37.291,01:20:38.542,A gift for you.
01:20:43.922,01:20:46.008,What was that about saving bullets?
01:20:52.348,01:20:54.725,"BLACKWOOD: She followed you here, Holmes."
01:20:56.727,01:20:59.605,You led your lamb to slaughter.
01:21:02.566,01:21:03.942,Holmes.
01:21:05.527,01:21:07.279,This game was designed to hurt.
01:21:19.041,01:21:20.376,Watson!
01:21:24.630,01:21:25.798,"It's warm in here, Watson."
01:21:33.138,01:21:34.640,"In over your head yet, darling?"
01:21:42.564,01:21:44.274,WATSON: Hold on there. ADLER: I can't.
01:21:44.441,01:21:46.110,Let me take your weight.
01:21:47.236,01:21:49.029,"HOLMES: Give us a leg up, old boy."
01:21:51.532,01:21:53.325,These German locks always give me trouble.
01:21:59.081,01:22:00.582,It's a band saw.
01:22:04.002,01:22:06.004,"No matter, we have plenty of time."
01:22:07.714,01:22:09.049,Holmes.
01:22:17.182,01:22:19.184,-It's not working. -Keep calm.
01:22:27.317,01:22:29.153,"Holmes, hurry up."
01:22:36.702,01:22:39.538,Don't get excited. Turn off that valve.
01:23:04.646,01:23:06.648,"And we'll bounce in three, two..."
01:23:08.066,01:23:09.234,...one.
01:23:19.828,01:23:21.413,Thank you.
01:23:21.914,01:23:23.582,I'm gonna get after Blackwood.
01:23:33.467,01:23:34.885,Thank you.
01:23:35.302,01:23:37.930,We should help the doctor.
01:23:49.358,01:23:51.026,Holmes!
01:25:26.622,01:25:28.040,Sir.
01:25:31.585,01:25:33.503,Mr. Holmes.
01:25:42.220,01:25:46.058,"Mr. Holmes, we have an order for your arrest, sir."
01:25:51.313,01:25:54.983,"Lord Coward has issued a warrant for your arrest, sir."
01:25:56.276,01:25:57.778,"Now, Watson's alive."
01:25:57.944,01:26:00.864,"Just get out of here, sir. Go, sir, go."
01:26:17.089,01:26:19.007,Will the train be departing on time?
01:26:19.174,01:26:21.468,"The train's been delayed, madam."
01:26:21.635,01:26:23.679,"Shouldn't be long now, though."
01:26:39.986,01:26:43.615,MAN: The train will depart when I tell it to.
01:26:45.242,01:26:48.537,And you will leave my employment when I allow you to.
01:26:52.874,01:26:55.210,I fulfilled my contract.
01:26:55.377,01:26:56.628,I found Reordan.
01:26:56.795,01:26:58.964,He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.
01:26:59.131,01:27:00.966,"So that's me, finished."
01:27:01.133,01:27:05.011,MAN: Your job was to manipulate Holmes' feelings for you...
01:27:05.178,01:27:06.763,...not succumb to them.
01:27:09.641,01:27:11.476,You have fulfilled nothing.
01:27:11.643,01:27:14.312,I want what Reordan was making for Blackwood.
01:27:14.938,01:27:18.483,Finish the job or the next dead body...
01:27:18.650,01:27:21.278,...will be Sherlock Holmes.
01:27:47.888,01:27:49.848,DOCTOR: The surgeon should be along shortly.
01:27:54.686,01:27:57.022,He should be able to rest now.
01:28:00.150,01:28:01.651,Excuse me.
01:28:05.655,01:28:07.365,Is that the best you can do?
01:28:07.532,01:28:09.367,"Yes, for now."
01:28:09.534,01:28:11.661,I must attend to my other patients.
01:28:13.705,01:28:15.081,MARY: Doctor.
01:28:15.540,01:28:17.209,Doctor.
01:28:17.667,01:28:19.294,Please.
01:28:22.964,01:28:26.218,I know that you care for him as much as I do.
01:28:26.384,01:28:29.805,"This is not your responsibility, it was his choice."
01:28:30.764,01:28:33.725,He'd say that it was worth the wounds.
01:28:40.357,01:28:42.234,Solve this.
01:28:43.068,01:28:45.070,Whatever it takes.
01:28:55.372,01:28:57.249,BLACKWOOD: This is beyond your control.
01:28:57.415,01:28:59.042,"CLARK: Sheer bloody panic, sir. Panic."
01:28:59.209,01:29:02.003,"-It's Lord Blackwood, sir. ADLER: I've never been in over my head."
01:29:02.170,01:29:06.049,"WATSON: It's nothing to do with me, but I advise you leave the case alone."
01:29:06.216,01:29:07.884,"MARY: Solve this. WATSON: Are you, Holmes?"
01:29:08.051,01:29:10.053,BLACKWOOD: Accept that this was beyond your control.
01:29:10.220,01:29:13.557,"-Tomorrow, at midday, the world will end. LESTRADE: I've got a public in frenzy."
01:29:13.723,01:29:15.058,WATSON: Holmes!
01:29:36.121,01:29:37.747,BLACKWOOD: Widen your gaze.
01:29:37.914,01:29:40.458,You must widen your gaze. Widen your gaze.
01:29:40.625,01:29:45.046,You and I are bound together on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature.
01:29:45.213,01:29:47.299,"Steel your mind, Holmes. Widen your gaze."
01:29:47.465,01:29:49.885,ROTHERAM: He's gonna raise a force that will alter the world.
01:29:50.051,01:29:52.929,COWARD: His power grows daily. ROTHERAM: This is the source of his power.
01:29:53.096,01:29:54.097,BLACKWOOD: I need you.
01:29:54.264,01:29:56.808,ROTHERAM: His secret lies in the book of spells.
01:30:24.085,01:30:26.880,BLACKWOOD: Three more will die...
01:30:27.505,01:30:30.300,...and there is nothing you can do to save them.
01:30:30.967,01:30:33.345,STANDISH: We know you don't believe in magic.
01:30:34.512,01:30:36.222,WATSON: Reordan was working with Blackwood.
01:30:36.389,01:30:37.431,ADLER: Is that better?
01:30:37.599,01:30:40.060,WATSON: He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
01:30:42.854,01:30:45.190,And the only thing missing was his ring.
01:30:52.280,01:30:54.199,"BLACKWOOD: Give up, Holmes."
01:30:56.493,01:30:58.870,This is a riddle you cannot solve.
01:31:05.168,01:31:06.378,ADLER: Good morning.
01:31:09.965,01:31:13.051,"Now, you need to work."
01:31:13.927,01:31:15.178,Familiar artwork.
01:31:18.306,01:31:19.557,You look gorgeous.
01:31:22.644,01:31:25.021,HOLMES: Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.
01:31:32.904,01:31:34.406,You made the front page.
01:31:34.823,01:31:36.533,Only a name and no picture.
01:31:37.909,01:31:41.871,So it looks like you'll be needing to work outside the law now...
01:31:42.038,01:31:44.082,...and that's my area of expertise.
01:31:44.249,01:31:46.209,I feel safer already.
01:31:48.586,01:31:50.797,You seem to be making a rapid recovery.
01:31:52.090,01:31:53.717,Yes.
01:31:53.925,01:31:56.428,Took the shrapnel out myself.
01:31:56.594,01:31:59.431,Mary said I had a lousy doctor.
01:32:04.686,01:32:06.187,"Well, I'm...."
01:32:06.604,01:32:08.148,I'm just so...
01:32:08.314,01:32:09.899,...very glad that you're...
01:32:10.066,01:32:11.443,...well...
01:32:11.901,01:32:13.361,...with us.
01:32:17.531,01:32:21.870,"Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin."
01:32:22.370,01:32:25.415,My initial approach was far too narrow.
01:32:25.582,01:32:28.043,When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville Prison...
01:32:28.209,01:32:31.629,"...he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that."
01:32:31.796,01:32:36.801,"In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity."
01:32:38.136,01:32:40.472,But that's for another time.
01:32:40.638,01:32:43.808,Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system...
01:32:43.975,01:32:47.270,...that's been employed by the Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.
01:32:47.437,01:32:50.523,"To fully understand the system, to get inside it..."
01:32:50.690,01:32:54.235,...I reenacted the ceremony we interrupted at the crypt...
01:32:54.402,01:32:56.321,...with a few enhancements of my own.
01:32:57.280,01:33:01.326,My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended...
01:33:01.493,01:33:05.997,"...and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail, I have emerged enlightened."
01:33:07.290,01:33:09.834,The fraternity who silently control the empire...
01:33:10.001,01:33:13.171,"...share the belief with the kings, pharaohs and emperors of old..."
01:33:13.338,01:33:16.132,...that the sphinx was a door to another dimension...
01:33:16.299,01:33:18.384,...a gateway to immeasurable power.
01:33:18.551,01:33:22.305,"It's made up of four parts: the foot of a lion, the tail of an ox..."
01:33:22.472,01:33:24.849,"...the wings of an eagle, and the head of a man."
01:33:25.642,01:33:28.561,"In Sir Thomas's secret chamber, I found the bone of an ox..."
01:33:28.728,01:33:31.815,"...the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle and hair of a man."
01:33:31.981,01:33:33.358,Map.
01:33:37.195,01:33:40.031,The points of the star represent the five murdered girls...
01:33:40.198,01:33:43.159,...but the cross is what we're now interested in.
01:33:43.409,01:33:44.702,It's a widely held belief...
01:33:44.869,01:33:48.248,...that within the architecture of the great cities...
01:33:48.414,01:33:51.167,...are coded references to this system.
01:33:51.334,01:33:54.337,"Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men..."
01:33:54.504,01:33:58.007,...each committed at a location that has a connection with the temple...
01:33:58.174,01:33:59.551,...therefore the system.
01:34:01.344,01:34:03.555,"Reordan, the ginger midget, represents man."
01:34:03.721,01:34:05.723,We found his body here.
01:34:06.349,01:34:09.561,"Sir Thomas, master of the temple, wore the ox ring."
01:34:10.520,01:34:12.063,He died here.
01:34:12.897,01:34:14.524,"Standish, ambassador to America..."
01:34:14.691,01:34:17.819,...where the eagle has been the national emblem for over 100 years.
01:34:17.986,01:34:22.073,The headquarters of the Temple of the Four Orders where he died...
01:34:22.240,01:34:24.492,...is here.
01:34:25.160,01:34:28.496,"Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act."
01:34:28.662,01:34:31.499,"So we have man, the ox, eagle."
01:34:32.417,01:34:33.585,Only the lion remaining.
01:34:33.751,01:34:34.919,Right here.
01:34:37.589,01:34:38.756,Parliament.
01:34:43.595,01:34:45.054,Right.
01:34:45.221,01:34:48.766,You four stay here and the rest of you come with me.
01:34:48.933,01:34:51.811,"LESTRADE: Get out of the way, you lowlifes! -Right this way."
01:34:55.273,01:34:57.108,Ladies first.
01:34:57.275,01:34:58.776,LESTRADE: Now.
01:34:59.736,01:35:01.029,HOLMES: Follow these instructions.
01:35:01.196,01:35:02.739,-Aren't you--? HOLMES: Go.
01:35:06.367,01:35:08.536,"Hello, hello, hello."
01:35:09.162,01:35:11.289,Did the devil turn up?
01:35:12.540,01:35:13.917,Well...
01:35:14.292,01:35:15.960,...never mind.
01:35:16.461,01:35:18.129,You got the next best thing.
01:35:41.486,01:35:45.823,"Beg your pardon, my Lord. I know that it's unorthodox..."
01:35:46.991,01:35:48.493,...but Mr. Holmes here...
01:35:48.660,01:35:52.330,...he's been making some serious accusations about you...
01:35:53.539,01:35:55.083,...and the order.
01:35:57.126,01:35:58.169,I see.
01:35:58.336,01:36:02.507,"Well, at least that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector."
01:36:07.845,01:36:09.806,"Excuse me, my Lord..."
01:36:10.348,01:36:12.850,...but I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
01:36:13.017,01:36:16.688,"Well, inspector, I have five minutes before my next engagement..."
01:36:17.313,01:36:20.692,...so why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracy?
01:36:23.777,01:36:25.280,"Thank you, Lestrade."
01:36:25.779,01:36:27.365,My Lord.
01:36:33.204,01:36:36.332,"I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist Blackwood in all the murders..."
01:36:36.541,01:36:38.501,...or just the one I prevented?
01:36:39.669,01:36:42.130,"Very distinctive, those handmade shoes of yours."
01:36:44.549,01:36:49.429,But the price of quality is often the unique imprint they leave.
01:36:50.388,01:36:53.558,"Nonetheless, I confess to being completely outmatched."
01:36:54.309,01:36:57.020,I could deduce very little from my investigation.
01:36:58.396,01:37:00.565,"Fortunately, there's nothing more stimulating..."
01:37:00.732,01:37:03.067,...than a case where everything goes against you.
01:37:03.735,01:37:07.238,How many members of Parliament do you intend to murder at noon today?
01:37:07.405,01:37:09.032,"Man, ox, eagle, lion."
01:37:09.907,01:37:11.492,"The lion is Parliament, isn't it?"
01:37:14.579,01:37:16.289,Very clever.
01:37:16.706,01:37:19.250,"But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes."
01:37:19.417,01:37:21.085,It's mercy.
01:37:21.252,01:37:23.755,We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd.
01:37:23.921,01:37:26.382,Don't you see that it's for their own...?
01:37:29.177,01:37:31.888,"HOLMES: No, but I don't care much what you think."
01:37:32.055,01:37:34.932,I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's ceremony...
01:37:35.099,01:37:36.517,...and you've given it to me.
01:37:36.684,01:37:37.894,I've told you nothing.
01:37:38.478,01:37:41.773,HOLMES: But your clothes say infinitely more than you could ever hope.
01:37:41.939,01:37:44.692,The mud on your boots from where you've been walking.
01:37:45.276,01:37:48.613,A touch of red brick dust on your knee from where you've been kneeling.
01:37:49.906,01:37:53.117,A small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing.
01:37:53.284,01:37:57.288,A faint aroma of excrement from where you've been standing.
01:37:59.540,01:38:02.293,You and Blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony...
01:38:02.460,01:38:05.546,...in the sewers beneath Parliament less than an hour ago.
01:38:06.631,01:38:08.633,Both houses meet today.
01:38:09.217,01:38:11.219,The whole government will be present.
01:38:20.603,01:38:23.897,"COWARD: It's a shame you made an enemy out of Blackwood, Holmes."
01:38:24.607,01:38:26.401,You would have made a valuable ally.
01:38:33.825,01:38:35.743,How terrible is wisdom...
01:38:35.909,01:38:38.788,...when it brings no profit to the wise.
01:38:39.497,01:38:40.998,We take power at noon.
01:38:41.999,01:38:44.335,"There isn't any time to waste then, is there?"
01:39:11.195,01:39:13.448,TANNER: I told you he'd be coming out the top window.
01:39:13.614,01:39:16.117,There isn't any way he'd be coming over that terrace.
01:39:16.284,01:39:19.120,"Technically, that isn't the top window, is it, sailor boy?"
01:39:19.287,01:39:21.789,"-What is it? -Well, it's the middle window."
01:39:21.955,01:39:23.124,Anyway.
01:39:24.208,01:39:26.794,You'll be pleased to know Lestrade performed perfectly.
01:39:26.960,01:39:28.629,"In fact, I think he enjoyed it."
01:39:28.796,01:39:30.506,I hope you know what you're doing.
01:39:31.215,01:39:32.884,Here's the key.
01:39:33.050,01:39:36.888,"-You got all you needed from Coward? -Yes, I smoked him out with relative ease."
01:39:38.264,01:39:39.307,-Tanner? -Sir?
01:39:39.474,01:39:40.725,"If you would, captain..."
01:39:40.892,01:39:43.728,"...take us under the bridge, port side, 100 yards."
01:39:43.895,01:39:47.231,Beyond that you'll find the tunnel that leads us to the sewers.
01:39:47.398,01:39:48.816,"Right away, sir."
01:39:55.573,01:39:57.450,The end is nigh.
01:39:57.617,01:40:01.913,Blackwood's come back from hell and laid a curse upon this land.
01:40:02.079,01:40:05.708,He walks in every shadow and every puff of smoke.
01:40:05.875,01:40:08.544,"Behold, he cometh with clouds..."
01:40:08.711,01:40:11.547,...and every eye shall see him...
01:40:11.714,01:40:15.301,...and every soul shall wail because of him.
01:40:15.468,01:40:18.471,You cannot stop him! No one can!
01:40:54.257,01:40:55.383,The first of its kind.
01:40:55.550,01:40:57.510,You deduced that how?
01:40:57.677,01:40:59.428,From my pocket.
01:40:59.595,01:41:02.598,I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse.
01:41:02.765,01:41:05.893,"Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds."
01:41:06.059,01:41:08.145,-Telltale traces of cyanide. ADLER: Cyanide.
01:41:08.312,01:41:09.897,WATSON: Shh.
01:41:12.942,01:41:15.278,HOLMES: Now we know what the ginger midget was working on.
01:41:15.444,01:41:17.321,It'll revolutionize warfare.
01:41:19.198,01:41:21.826,"Now, it's seven minutes to noon. What are we gonna do?"
01:41:23.327,01:41:24.996,Right. How many men did you count on the--?
01:41:28.583,01:41:30.626,"She loves an entrance, your muse."
01:42:03.826,01:42:05.703,"Shoot him. Now, please."
01:42:18.090,01:42:19.132,My lords.
01:42:19.759,01:42:20.801,My lords.
01:42:21.218,01:42:22.845,My lords.
01:42:23.804,01:42:25.056,The time has come...
01:42:25.222,01:42:27.558,...for only those who believe to remain.
01:42:29.393,01:42:30.686,Behold...
01:42:30.853,01:42:32.730,...Lord Blackwood.
01:42:45.701,01:42:47.370,You seem surprised.
01:42:50.081,01:42:53.501,I have returned from beyond the grave to fulfill England's destiny...
01:42:54.669,01:42:58.422,...and extend the boundaries of this great empire.
01:43:01.092,01:43:03.052,Listen to the rabble outside.
01:43:03.719,01:43:05.221,Listen...
01:43:05.388,01:43:06.764,...to the fear.
01:43:07.390,01:43:09.058,I will use that as a weapon...
01:43:09.225,01:43:11.143,...to control them...
01:43:11.644,01:43:12.895,...and then the world.
01:43:17.274,01:43:19.568,I've never seen anything like it. Look at this.
01:43:23.196,01:43:26.199,Specifically designed to prevent us from disarming it.
01:43:28.869,01:43:31.747,These appear to be designed to receive a signal of some sort.
01:43:31.914,01:43:33.124,Electromagnetic waves?
01:43:33.290,01:43:34.959,"HOLMES: When triggered, the electrodes..."
01:43:35.126,01:43:37.712,...will send a charge converting the chemical into gas.
01:43:37.878,01:43:41.757,The gas will travel up that shaft and filter through the ventilation system...
01:43:41.924,01:43:44.552,...that leads directly to Parliament. Within seconds...
01:43:44.719,01:43:47.805,...the most powerful men in the world will be choking on death.
01:43:47.972,01:43:51.308,Blackwood must have some transmitter that he can activate remotely.
01:43:51.475,01:43:53.310,"Three minutes, 10 seconds."
01:43:53.728,01:43:57.815,I will create an empire that will endure for millennia...
01:43:58.441,01:44:00.067,...indestructible...
01:44:00.233,01:44:01.485,...and eternal.
01:44:02.069,01:44:03.904,Move it. Move it.
01:44:04.321,01:44:06.824,We don't actually have to disarm the device...
01:44:06.991,01:44:10.536,...we just have to remove the cylinders.
01:44:10.703,01:44:13.664,"Yes, except that they're welded in."
01:44:13.831,01:44:16.959,What we need is a controlled explosion.
01:44:17.126,01:44:20.713,We'll need a container to direct the blast. My clay pipe should service that ambition.
01:44:41.484,01:44:44.111,"I rather wish you hadn't done that, Irene."
01:44:50.409,01:44:55.414,"On the 12th chime, I will summon the dark powers."
01:44:55.998,01:45:00.336,All those of you who are with me shall be protected.
01:45:00.503,01:45:01.545,All others...
01:45:01.712,01:45:03.047,...will perish.
01:45:10.303,01:45:11.972,I need your pipe.
01:45:15.643,01:45:17.061,Nut him!
01:45:42.335,01:45:43.754,-Right. -What?
01:45:43.921,01:45:45.589,-Coat. -Got it.
01:46:23.794,01:46:25.087,The new order...
01:46:26.547,01:46:27.631,...begins now.
01:46:33.804,01:46:34.805,Woman.
01:46:35.639,01:46:37.266,What are you waiting for?
01:46:40.144,01:46:41.353,That.
01:46:52.656,01:46:54.325,MAN: Apprehend Lord Coward.
01:46:56.911,01:46:58.787,-Can you manage? -Course I can.
01:47:25.814,01:47:27.232,Relax...
01:47:27.399,01:47:28.441,...I'm a doctor.
01:48:40.597,01:48:43.017,Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?
01:48:45.060,01:48:46.270,We're safe now.
01:48:47.312,01:48:48.605,Interesting assessment.
01:48:51.150,01:48:52.818,Run off.
01:48:55.070,01:48:56.864,I won't be chasing you anymore.
01:48:58.449,01:49:00.284,Fare thee well.
01:49:05.456,01:49:07.458,I don't want to run anymore.
01:49:10.335,01:49:12.796,-I'll tell you everything. -I wish you would.
01:49:36.987,01:49:38.155,No!
01:50:44.012,01:50:45.472,There was never any magic.
01:50:47.724,01:50:49.226,Only conjuring tricks.
01:50:53.856,01:50:55.858,The simplest involved paying people off...
01:50:56.024,01:50:59.278,...like the guard who pretended to be possessed outside your cell.
01:50:59.444,01:51:01.989,Your reputation and the inmates' fear did the rest.
01:51:03.574,01:51:06.076,Others required more elaborate preparations...
01:51:06.243,01:51:09.538,...like the sandstone slab that covered your tomb.
01:51:10.497,01:51:14.459,"You had it broken before your burial, then put back together using an adhesive."
01:51:15.794,01:51:18.255,"An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe..."
01:51:18.422,01:51:20.507,...a mixture of egg and honey...
01:51:21.175,01:51:23.427,...designed to be washed away by the rain.
01:51:28.432,01:51:29.766,Holmes!
01:51:29.933,01:51:32.685,Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub...
01:51:32.853,01:51:34.687,...required more modern science.
01:51:34.855,01:51:37.774,Very clever of Reordan to find a paralytic...
01:51:37.941,01:51:40.944,...that was activated by the combination of copper and water...
01:51:41.111,01:51:44.448,...and was therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.
01:51:45.282,01:51:47.284,That might've been a challenge for me...
01:51:47.451,01:51:51.038,...had he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians.
01:51:55.708,01:51:58.795,The death of Standish was a real mystery...
01:51:58.962,01:52:02.049,...until you used the same compound to blow up the wharf.
01:52:03.383,01:52:05.802,"An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid..."
01:52:06.428,01:52:08.555,...yet it burned with an unusual pinkish hue.
01:52:10.641,01:52:13.977,Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered the temple?
01:52:15.145,01:52:16.605,All it took was a spark.
01:52:21.068,01:52:23.278,A simple rigged bullet in his gun.
01:52:24.737,01:52:26.156,Ingenious.
01:52:26.323,01:52:34.747,"Like all great performers, you saved your pièce de résistance for the end: A chemical weapon distilled from cyanide and refined in the bellies of swine."
01:52:34.915,01:52:36.458,Had it worked...
01:52:36.625,01:52:39.503,...your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed...
01:52:39.670,01:52:42.172,...as their colleagues were dying around them.
01:52:42.339,01:52:44.341,They didn't know you'd given them the antidote.
01:52:44.508,01:52:46.927,"Instead, they would've believed it was magic..."
01:52:47.094,01:52:49.805,...and that you'd harnessed the ultimate power.
01:52:50.138,01:52:53.850,"And the world would've followed, fear being the most powerful weapon of all."
01:52:55.811,01:52:58.689,You'd better hope that it's nothing more than superstition...
01:52:58.855,01:53:01.024,...as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
01:53:01.858,01:53:03.819,"The devil is due a soul, I'd say."
01:53:06.113,01:53:08.198,"For God's sake, Holmes, cut me loose."
01:53:19.001,01:53:22.629,"HOLMES: First, the world will see you for what you are. A fraud."
01:53:24.214,01:53:25.549,Then you'll be hanged.
01:53:25.716,01:53:27.551,"Properly, this time."
01:53:27.718,01:53:29.845,It's a long journey from here to the rope.
01:54:21.188,01:54:24.107,I've never woken up in handcuffs before.
01:54:25.108,01:54:26.651,I have.
01:54:27.944,01:54:29.529,Naked.
01:54:33.492,01:54:35.619,ADLER: Storm's coming.
01:54:35.911,01:54:39.456,"HOLMES: Well, we've still got a moment."
01:54:43.460,01:54:44.711,Moriarty.
01:54:44.878,01:54:46.296,What?
01:54:46.463,01:54:48.465,That's his name.
01:54:49.049,01:54:51.218,And he is a professor.
01:54:53.345,01:54:55.430,Everyone has a weak spot...
01:54:55.847,01:54:58.100,...and he found mine.
01:54:59.518,01:55:01.478,"Where was it, precisely?"
01:55:12.364,01:55:15.492,-Please don't underestimate him. -Mm.
01:55:15.659,01:55:18.036,He's just as brilliant as you are...
01:55:18.203,01:55:20.455,...and infinitely more devious.
01:55:20.622,01:55:22.833,We'll see about that.
01:55:39.307,01:55:41.685,"You'll miss me, Sherlock."
01:55:43.687,01:55:45.355,Sadly...
01:55:45.981,01:55:47.649,...yes.
01:56:13.008,01:56:14.843,WATSON: Just keep it under your hat.
01:56:15.010,01:56:17.929,"DRIVER: Afternoon, sir. I put the notebooks in this one, sir."
01:56:18.096,01:56:20.056,"WATSON: Thank you. -What's in these, John?"
01:56:20.223,01:56:21.224,Scribbles.
01:56:21.391,01:56:22.893,-Scribbles? -Notes.
01:56:23.059,01:56:25.729,MARY: They're your adventures. I'd like to read them.
01:56:32.569,01:56:33.904,"Come on, what's wrong?"
01:56:34.070,01:56:36.615,Do you think he's come to terms with you leaving?
01:56:36.781,01:56:40.160,"Mary, look at the ring he's given us."
01:56:40.785,01:56:43.079,"Now, five minutes here and we'll go home."
01:56:43.246,01:56:44.623,Our home.
01:56:44.789,01:56:46.458,Get up those stairs.
01:56:54.382,01:56:55.926,"Don't worry, dear."
01:56:56.092,01:56:58.178,Suicide is not in his repertoire.
01:56:58.345,01:57:00.639,He's far too fond of himself for that.
01:57:01.264,01:57:02.933,Holmes.
01:57:04.559,01:57:06.686,Oh. Good afternoon.
01:57:06.853,01:57:10.941,I was trying to deduce the manner in which Blackwood survived his execution.
01:57:11.107,01:57:13.193,"Clearing your good name, as it were."
01:57:13.527,01:57:16.071,But it had a surprisingly soporific effect...
01:57:16.238,01:57:19.950,...and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
01:57:20.116,01:57:21.451,"Good afternoon, dear."
01:57:21.618,01:57:23.286,"WATSON: Get on with it, Holmes."
01:57:23.453,01:57:27.123,Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook.
01:57:27.290,01:57:30.293,"Oh, dear, my legs have fallen asleep. I should come down."
01:57:30.460,01:57:32.045,"John, shouldn't we help him down?"
01:57:32.212,01:57:34.631,"No, no, no, I hate to cut him off midstream."
01:57:34.798,01:57:35.966,Carry on.
01:57:37.008,01:57:39.678,"Well, the executioner attached it to a harness..."
01:57:39.844,01:57:42.639,...allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist...
01:57:42.806,01:57:44.849,...and the neck to remain intact.
01:57:45.016,01:57:48.478,"My Lord, I can't feel my cheeks. Might we continue this at ground level?"
01:57:48.645,01:57:50.272,"How did you manage it, Holmes?"
01:57:50.897,01:57:54.109,"I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook."
01:57:55.068,01:57:57.946,"Please, my tongue is going, I'll be of no use to you at all."
01:57:58.113,01:57:59.823,-Worse things could happen. -John.
01:58:02.659,01:58:05.787,Yet none of this explains Blackwood's lack of pulse.
01:58:05.954,01:58:07.330,HOLMES: Right.
01:58:07.497,01:58:12.794,"Now, the medical mystery. We must restore your reputation, Watson."
01:58:12.961,01:58:16.590,There is a toxin refined from the nectar of the rhododendron ponticum.
01:58:16.756,01:58:19.843,It's infamous in the region of Turkey bordering the Black Sea...
01:58:20.010,01:58:23.513,...for its ability to induce an apparently mortal paralysis.
01:58:23.680,01:58:27.100,Enough to mislead a medical mind even as well-trained as your own.
01:58:27.267,01:58:29.603,-It's known as-- -What's wrong with Gladstone?
01:58:29.769,01:58:31.646,HOLMES: --mad honey disease.
01:58:31.813,01:58:35.609,"Oh, he's demonstrating the very effect I've just described."
01:58:35.984,01:58:37.319,He doesn't mind.
01:58:39.863,01:58:42.282,"Mary, don't worry, he's seen far worse."
01:58:42.907,01:58:44.284,CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
01:58:46.578,01:58:47.829,Doctor. Miss Mary.
01:58:48.538,01:58:51.666,"Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me right away."
01:58:52.208,01:58:55.545,"-What is it is this time, Clarkie? -It's one of our sergeants, sir."
01:58:55.712,01:58:58.298,He went missing the day you stopped Lord Blackwood.
01:58:58.465,01:59:02.052,"I'm afraid sewage workers found his body just this morning, sir."
01:59:02.510,01:59:05.555,We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene.
01:59:05.722,01:59:07.515,"Can I help you, officer?"
01:59:08.266,01:59:09.309,Shot in the head.
01:59:10.977,01:59:12.729,Was it a small caliber bullet?
01:59:13.855,01:59:15.190,Yes.
01:59:16.691,01:59:18.943,Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
01:59:19.110,01:59:20.779,"Indeed, sir."
01:59:22.906,01:59:24.240,Point blank range?
01:59:24.407,01:59:25.659,Moriarty.
01:59:27.077,01:59:29.245,Professor Moriarty.
01:59:31.790,01:59:33.750,"MARY: Oh, there's a good boy."
01:59:33.917,01:59:35.502,Everything's gonna be fine.
01:59:36.711,01:59:38.380,Where is Blackwood's device now?
01:59:38.546,01:59:41.591,"Secret Service have it, sir. They've taken over the case."
01:59:42.092,01:59:44.302,I'd wager there's a piece missing.
01:59:46.262,01:59:49.307,So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine...
01:59:49.933,01:59:51.184,...not the poison.
01:59:51.351,01:59:53.770,There's nothing more elusive than an obvious fact.
01:59:53.937,01:59:56.398,The wire-free invention was the game all along.
01:59:56.564,01:59:59.025,And Adler was just the diversion.
01:59:59.192,02:00:01.820,"He knew I'd chase her, leaving the machine accessible."
02:00:01.986,02:00:05.865,A technology of that kind would be worth an untold fortune.
02:00:06.032,02:00:08.326,Imagine being able to control any device...
02:00:08.493,02:00:12.163,...simply by sending a command via radio waves.
02:00:12.956,02:00:14.958,"It's the future, Watson."
02:00:17.252,02:00:19.713,"I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir."
02:00:23.049,02:00:24.634,-Well.... -Well....
02:00:25.969,02:00:28.847,MARY: Gladstone. -Stop him before he gets to the front door.
02:00:29.431,02:00:30.849,HOLMES: Clarkie.
02:00:33.101,02:00:34.686,Case reopened.
