00:20:36.693,00:20:38.195,"It was 20,000 people."
00:20:38.737,00:20:41.907,Another million and a half sitting at home watching it on pay-per-view.
00:20:42.407,00:20:44.618,We're slamming the piss out of each other.
00:20:44.701,00:20:47.704,"I mean, for God knows how long. We're both gassing."
00:20:48.497,00:20:51.375,"You ask any wrestling fan, they've heard about that one."
00:20:51.458,00:20:53.835,"-Million and a half. Shit. -Oh, yeah, it was big."
00:20:53.919,00:20:56.588,And a rematch? Hey. This could be history all over again.
00:20:58.548,00:21:01.760,"Goddamn, look at you. You are one smoking baby."

00:21:04.721,00:21:05.931,Hmm?
00:21:06.014,00:21:08.225,"I mean, who knows? I'm in pretty good shape right now."
00:21:08.725,00:21:11.728,"You know, with a little luck, this could be my ticket back on top."
00:21:11.812,00:21:15.482,-You never know who's in that crowd. -Yeah. Yeah.
00:21:15.983,00:21:17.567,That would be a dream.
00:21:19.278,00:21:21.446,"Oh, Jesus. You're bleeding."
00:21:22.030,00:21:24.533,"-Oh! -Yeah, I got cut tonight."
00:21:26.910,00:21:31.832,"-Are you okay? -Yeah, it's nothin' -They say wrestling's fake, huh? -Fake? I'll show you fake."
00:21:31.915,00:21:34.376,"Look at this. 1986, Denver Coliseum."
00:21:34.459,00:21:36.920,Billy Bob Banjo hit me with a two-by-four.
00:21:37.004,00:21:40.382,"It had a loose nail in it, split my bicep right the hell open."
00:21:40.465,00:21:42.509,Look at that. I got a better one than that.
00:21:43.010,00:21:44.177,Take a look at this here.
00:21:44.845,00:21:48.598,"1988, okay? Orlando Civic Center."
00:21:49.099,00:21:51.643,Mr. Magnificent threw me over the top ropes.
00:21:51.727,00:21:55.022,I landed on my shoulder and cracked my clavicle right in half.
00:21:55.105,00:21:57.399,"Oh, my Gosh. Does it hurt?"
00:21:57.482,00:22:03.238,"Well, it hurts when I breathe but, I mean, you know, you hear the roar of the crowd, you just, you motor through, you know?"
00:22:05.115,00:22:07.034,He was pierced for our transgressions.

01:08:42.243,01:08:44.578,That's not really your present. I got you something else.
01:08:44.662,01:08:45.579,Hold on.
01:08:51.377,01:08:53.003,This is your real present.

01:09:10.104,01:09:12.815,"-Thank you. -Hey, anything for you, sweetheart."
01:09:13.732,01:09:15.067,So what are you doing right now?
01:09:16.443,01:09:17.528,What am I doing?
01:09:18.237,01:09:22.825,"You know, I thought maybe we could, you know, stop by our old favorite place."
01:09:24.034,01:09:25.870,We have an old favorite place?
01:09:25.953,01:09:28.372,You'll recognize it when you see it.
01:09:31.125,01:09:35.296,"Uh, now's not really the best time. I- I got some stuff I gotta do."
01:09:36.755,01:09:38.257,What kind of stuff?
01:09:38.340,01:09:41.135,Just stuff.
01:09:41.218,01:09:45.681,"Come on. I'm not gonna, like- I'm not gonna take a bite out of you or anything."
01:09:45.764,01:09:48.225,"Just, you know, hang out for a little while."
01:09:53.898,01:09:55.524,I haven't been here in ages.
01:09:58.402,01:10:00.237,You remember the fun house?
01:10:01.906,01:10:04.617,Right there. Used to be the Monster Motel.
01:10:04.700,01:10:06.285,"-Kinda. -Oh, you loved it."
01:10:06.368,01:10:10.456,"We used to go in there, and they had this, uh, spooky-ass skeleton."
01:10:10.539,01:10:12.625,It would pop out of a coffin.
01:10:12.708,01:10:15.085,You'd get really scared and cry and wanna run out.
01:10:15.169,01:10:18.172,And then-then you'd beg to go back in again.
01:10:18.839,01:10:21.717,Oh. Always was a glutton for punishment.
01:10:21.800,01:10:26.513,"Yeah, you wouldn't go in unless you could sit on my foot and wrap your arms around my leg."
01:10:27.139,01:10:29.183,And we'd walk all the way through like that.
01:10:29.266,01:10:31.310,"Ah, I don't even remember that."
01:10:32.937,01:10:33.854,I do.
01:10:48.244,01:10:52.665,I'm the one who was supposed to take care of everything.
01:10:53.290,01:10:58.212,I'm the one who was supposed to make everything okay for everybody.
01:11:00.547,01:11:02.424,But it just didn't work out like that.
01:11:04.051,01:11:05.261,And I left.
01:11:05.844,01:11:07.221,I left you.
01:11:09.139,01:11:10.849,You never did anything wrong.
01:11:11.392,01:11:22.069,You know? I used to try to- I used to try to pretend that you didn't exist.
01:11:23.737,01:11:25.030,But I can't.
01:11:28.534,01:11:29.785,You're my girl.
01:11:30.869,01:11:33.539,"You're my little, you're my little girl."
01:11:34.498,01:11:42.589,"And now- I'm an old, broken-down piece of meat."
01:11:44.967,01:11:45.968,And I'm alone.
01:11:47.636,01:11:49.763,And I deserve to be all alone.
01:11:51.515,01:11:53.642,I just don't want you to hate me.
01:12:01.066,01:12:02.067,Okay?
01:12:27.092,01:12:28.302,Hey.
01:12:32.431,01:12:33.515,Oh.
01:12:36.310,01:12:37.936,"Oh, man, we can't go in there."
01:12:38.645,01:12:39.938,Come on.
01:12:43.859,01:12:45.152,"Oh, God."
01:12:48.697,01:12:50.324,"Whoo, man. Wow."
01:12:50.407,01:12:52.993,This must have been a ballroom or something.
01:12:54.620,01:12:58.540,"Oh, look at this. We can- Hey, here we go."
01:13:00.376,01:13:02.920,-What is that? -It's my bow to you.
01:13:04.546,01:13:07.049,Am I supposed to bow back? I bow to you?
01:13:07.716,01:13:08.634,Ah.
01:13:14.515,01:13:18.852,"One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three."
01:13:24.483,01:13:26.402,You can lead. You're not bad.
01:13:26.485,01:13:27.861,"Well, thank you."
01:13:38.914,01:13:39.998,Hold on.
01:13:41.417,01:13:43.335,Wait. Let me get the door.
01:13:48.340,01:13:50.426,"Well, I hope that wasn't too painful for you."
01:13:54.805,01:13:56.807,"Okay, uh, bye."
01:13:57.307,01:13:58.392,Bye.
01:13:59.601,01:14:01.603,"Hey, maybe we could go out to dinner sometime."
01:14:02.646,01:14:05.065,"-Dinner? -You know, on Friday or something?"
01:14:06.775,01:14:08.277,Whatever works for you.
01:14:10.028,01:14:11.738,Saturday would be better.
01:14:12.364,01:14:14.366,-Saturday? -Yeah.
01:14:14.450,01:14:15.534,You got it.
01:14:21.206,01:14:22.166,"Oh, wow."

01:15:38.992,01:15:40.160,Come on. Open it.
01:15:42.162,01:15:43.664,I'll wait till later when it's quiet.
01:15:43.747,01:15:46.458,"Oh, come on. I want to watch your face when you read it."
01:16:00.931,01:16:02.683,Thank you. That's very sweet.
01:16:02.766,01:16:05.978,"Hey, thank you. I mean, come on, baby. You saved my ass."
01:16:09.439,01:16:10.524,What?
01:16:12.150,01:16:13.902,I can't do this.
01:16:13.986,01:16:15.445,Can't do what?
01:16:17.406,01:16:18.240,This.
01:16:20.659,01:16:22.744,I thought we had a little something going on here.

01:16:27.207,01:16:28.625,So what's the problem?
01:16:28.709,01:16:31.712,"You think that I'm, like, this stripper, and I'm not."

01:16:34.631,01:16:37.342,I have responsibilities. I have a son.
01:16:37.926,01:16:42.347,"Anyway, you don't want that fuckin' luggage, so… What if I do?"
01:16:43.640,01:16:44.933,I can't go there.
01:16:45.684,01:16:48.353,-What about the other day? -It was a mistake.
01:16:50.272,01:16:52.107,It didn't feel like a mistake to me.
01:16:52.691,01:16:55.277,The club and the real world- they don't mix.
01:16:55.861,01:17:00.449,"I don't know. I'll tell you, I think that's a lot of bullshit because I think you still feel something."
01:17:01.491,01:17:05.954,"You're a customer, okay? You're a fucking customer. I don't go out with customers."
01:17:06.038,01:17:07.122,You got it?

01:23:29.087,01:23:30.672,"No, I don't want to do that."
01:23:33.717,01:23:34.926,I've seen you get stressed out.
01:23:35.010,01:23:37.345,I don't want you to be stressed. Let me get this asshole out.
01:23:39.222,01:23:41.474,-Who said you could come in? -What are you doing in here?
01:23:41.558,01:23:43.810,"-I'm sorry, Stephanie. I'm so sorry. -No, get the fuck out!"
01:23:43.893,01:23:45.812,"I'm gonna handle this, okay? I can handle this."
01:23:45.895,01:23:47.480,-Obviously not. -I can handle this!
01:23:47.564,01:23:49.941,"Oh, come on. I'm sorry I screwed this up."
01:23:50.025,01:23:51.568,-I'm so sorry. -Wait. Don't worry.
01:23:51.651,01:23:54.529,-I just-You don't have to leave. -I'll be back.

01:23:56.072,01:24:02.037,"You know what, I waited in that restaurant for two hours. Two fucking hours telling myself, Maybe something happened. Maybe he's stuck in traffic."
01:24:02.120,01:24:04.789,"But, no! You just keep doing the same shit to me over and over again!"
01:24:04.873,01:24:06.499,"I know, and I apologize. Look, I apologize."
01:24:06.583,01:24:11.046,"I got a lot of stuff swimming around in my head and I went out and had a drink, and another drink, and I just spaced."
01:24:11.129,01:24:14.549,-That is tough shit! -Goddamn it. Why do I do this to you?
01:24:14.632,01:24:17.552,Because you are a fuck-up!
01:24:18.762,01:24:23.725,"You're a living, breathing fuck-up and I cannot fucking do it anymore!"
01:24:23.808,01:24:27.270,I can't stand it! I can't fucking cry for you! I can't fucking do it anymore!
01:24:27.353,01:24:31.775,I can't fucking- -You are a fucking asshole! -Calm down. Stop.

01:24:44.287,01:24:46.998,-Calm down. -You know what? I don't care.
01:24:48.249,01:24:51.336,I don't hate you. I don't love you.
01:24:51.419,01:24:52.754,I don't even like you.
01:24:53.713,01:24:55.757,And I was stupid to think that you could change.
01:24:55.840,01:24:56.966,I can. I can change.
01:24:57.050,01:25:00.053,-I don't care. -Come on.
01:25:00.136,01:25:03.848,There is no more fixing this.
01:25:04.349,01:25:07.685,It's broke. Permanently.
01:25:08.895,01:25:11.773,And I'm okay with that. It's better.
01:25:13.900,01:25:15.819,I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
01:25:19.864,01:25:23.034,I don't ever want to see you again.

01:27:21.861,01:27:22.904,At last.
01:27:24.572,01:27:28.534,What's with the line? Let's pick things up. All right? It's rush hour.
01:27:28.618,01:27:32.247,"Come on, people. Let's pick it up. Where's Katie?"

01:27:35.416,01:27:36.793,"Have a nice day, lady."
01:27:37.669,01:27:40.755,"Go. Go, go, go."
01:27:45.260,01:27:46.261,Thirty-one.
01:27:46.344,01:27:51.182,"Thirty-one. Yeah, can I get- -Do I know you from somewheres? -No."

01:28:29.971,01:28:31.055,That's freaky.
01:28:32.098,01:28:34.392,-You look just like the dude. -Yeah?
01:28:34.475,01:28:35.310,Except older.

01:31:57.303,01:32:06.395,"But, you know, at the same time, I have this line and I just- -I can't cross it. -No, I understand that. That's okay."

01:32:17.198,01:32:18.783,When is it? What?

01:34:38.381,01:34:39.840,They're not done with you yet.
01:34:50.101,01:34:51.560,You left your shoes.

01:35:29.098,01:35:31.934,"-The Beast of the Middle East, -See you out there."
01:35:32.017,01:35:36.355,The Ayatollah!
01:35:36.439,01:35:39.650,"-Hey, hey, hey. How much? How much? -Twenty dollars."
01:35:46.240,01:35:47.616,Which way's backstage?
01:35:55.958,01:35:57.293,This is backstage?
01:36:04.884,01:36:06.385,"That's what he said, huh?"
01:36:29.033,01:36:30.284,Randy.
01:36:30.367,01:36:33.496,-Hey. -Oh. What are you doing here?
01:36:33.579,01:36:35.039,What the fuck are you doing?
01:36:35.831,01:36:37.791,I'm doing my thing. I'm going to work.
01:36:37.875,01:36:40.503,"-Yeah, but-but your heart. -My heart?"
01:36:41.170,01:36:45.633,"My heart's still tickin' -Yeah, but the doctor said- -Listen. I know what I'm doing."
01:36:45.716,01:36:48.677,"And, you know, the only place I get hurt is out there."

01:36:55.142,01:36:56.060,I'm here.
01:36:59.605,01:37:00.689,I'm really here.

01:38:25.608,01:38:29.737,I just want to say to you all tonight.
01:38:30.946,01:38:33.282,I'm very grateful to be here.
01:38:34.658,01:38:39.079,A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again.
01:38:40.372,01:38:41.790,And that's all I do.
01:38:42.958,01:38:52.593,"You know, if you live hard, and you play hard you pay the price for it."
01:38:53.886,01:38:58.349,"You know, in this life you can lose everything that you love and everything that loves you."
01:38:58.849,01:39:03.270,Now I don't hear as good as I used to and I forget stuff.
01:39:04.271,01:39:06.440,and I ain't as pretty as I used to be.
01:39:06.523,01:39:10.569,"But goddamn it, I'm still standing here, and I'm the Ram."
01:39:13.155,01:39:18.786,"You know, as time goes by, as time goes by, they say, He's washed up."
01:39:19.620,01:39:23.040,He's finished. He's a loser.
01:39:23.123,01:39:32.841,He's all through.  The only ones who are gonna tell me when I'm through doing my thing is you people here.
01:39:35.469,01:39:43.602,"You people here. You people here are the ones who are worth bringing it for, because you're my family."
01:39:44.269,01:39:46.980,I love all of you. Thank you so much!
01:39:47.481,01:39:49.149,"Great talk, Randy."
01:39:51.735,01:39:52.611,Thank you.
01:40:00.202,01:40:01.203,Yeah!
01:40:07.543,01:40:08.836,"Pick it up, baby."

01:40:39.950,01:40:43.203,-What are you doing? This is my move! -Giving up?
01:40:43.996,01:40:47.291,"Steal my move, Randy? This is how you do it!"
01:40:47.916,01:40:49.334,This is how you do it!
01:40:50.878,01:40:53.589,"One, two, th-Hey! Who you pushing?"
01:40:53.672,01:40:55.841,-Do not tell me what to do! -You can't push me!
01:40:55.924,01:40:56.884,Don't tell me!
01:41:24.995,01:41:27.998,"I forgot how much fun this was, Ram!"
01:41:28.081,01:41:29.583,"Bring it, Bob!"
01:41:37.007,01:41:39.927,Asshole! Come on!
01:41:40.010,01:41:41.428,Infidel!
01:42:10.666,01:42:12.918,"Now I'm gonna take you out, baby!"
01:42:27.516,01:42:28.559,Let's take it home.
01:42:52.749,01:42:54.001,Ram? Are you all right?
01:42:55.043,01:42:56.128,"You okay, Ram?"
01:43:08.432,01:43:09.474,Ram?
01:43:11.351,01:43:12.728,I'll take it from here.
01:43:16.982,01:43:18.942,"Pin me! Come on, Ram. Pin me!"
01:43:20.569,01:43:22.029,We gave 'em enough.
01:43:41.256,01:43:43.926,"Ram-Ram, you okay? You all right?"
01:43:49.348,01:43:51.266,"It's okay, Ram. Take it home."
