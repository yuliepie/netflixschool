"Ball one to Johnny Damon"

"Damon has eight hits"

"He had four hits"
"in the series opener."

"Strike."

"Down the right-field line,"
"fair off the bat of Damon."

"It rolls by Spencer."

"And Damon will coast into"
"second base with a leadoff double."

"Into right-center field,"
"broken bat, it'll fall, a base hit."

"And Jason Giambi delivers..."

"...with a run-scoring single"
"here in the opening inning."

"And the Athletics"

"Let's go, Yankees!"
"Let's go, Yankees!"

"Let's go, Yankees!"

"Bases loaded."

"The Yankees have the tying run"
"at second, down 2-nothing."

"- The henhouse is there."

"- They played great."
"- They played their hearts out."

"- I wanna win just as much..."
"- That's my bar. My bar is here."

"My bar is to take this team"

"Billy, we're a small-market team,"

"Bye."

"- Just got off the phone with Dan."

"Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5"
"or he doesn't play anywhere else."

"- That's the deal you made."
"- Boston just upped it to 7. 75."

"You there?"

"- We had a deal, Scott."
"- We have a deal, if it's 8 million."

"I like guys that got a little hair"

"- He's got a baseball body."
"- Matty, who do you got?"

"- I like Geronimo."
"- Yes."

"The guy's an athlete."
"Big, fast, talented."
""
"- Top of my list."
"- Clean-cut, good face."
""
"- Yeah, good jaw."
"- Five-tools guy."
""
"- Good-looking ballplayer."
"- Can he hit?"
""
"- He's got a beautiful swing."
"- The ball explodes off his bat."
""
"He throws the club head at the ball,"
"and when he connects..."
""
"...he drives it, it pops off the bat."
""
"- You can hear it all over the ballpark."
"- A lot of pop."
""
"If he's good,"
"why doesn't he hit good?"
""
"- He is a good hitter."
"- He'll be ready."
""
"He's gonna be a good hitter"
"against big-league arms?"
""
"- Could be great."
"- I don't think so."
""
"Kid needs at bats. Give him"
"400 at bats, he's gonna get better."
""
"- He can play."
"- He's hit everywhere along the line."
""
"He's one of our guys."
""
"Okay, let's move on."
""
"- Artie, who do you like?"
"- I like Perez. He's got a classic swing."
""
"- It's a real clean stroke."
"- I don't know. Can't hit the curveball."
""
"There's some work to be done,"
"I'll admit that, but he's noticeable."
""
"- Got an ugly girlfriend."
"- What's that mean?"
""
"Ugly girlfriend"
"means no confidence."
""
"You are full of it. Artie is right."
"This guy's got an attitude."
""
"An attitude is good."
""
"He walks in a room, his dick's already"
"been there for two minutes."
""
"He passes the eye-candy test."
"Got the looks."
""
"He's ready to play the part."
"He just needs playing time."
""
"I'm just saying,"
"his girlfriend is a six at best."
""
"Look, if we're trying to replace Giambi,"
"this guy could be it."
""
"I agree with you."
""
"Damn, Billy, was that a suggestion?"
""
"Guys, you're just talking."
""
"Talking... like this is business"
"as usual."
""
"It's not."
""
"We're trying to solve the problem."
""
"Not like this."
"You're not looking at the problem."
""
"We're very aware of the problem."
"I mean..."
""
"Okay, good. What's the problem?"
""
"Look, Billy,"
"we all understand what the problem is."
""
"- We have to..."
"- Okay, good. What's the problem?"
""
"We have to replace three key players"
"in our lineup."
""
"Nope. What's the problem?"
""
"We gotta replace these guys"
"with what we have..."
""
"No. What's the problem, Barry?"
""
"We need 38 home runs, 120 RBIs"
"and 47 doubles to replace."
""
"The problem we're trying to solve"
"is that there are rich teams..."
""
"...and there are poor teams,"
"then there's 50 feet of crap..."
""
"...and then there's us."
""
"It's an unfair game."
""
"And now we've been gutted."
"We're like organ donors for the rich."
""
"Boston's taken our kidneys,"
"Yankees have taken our heart."
""
"And you guys sit around..."
""
"...talking the same old ""good body"""
"nonsense like we're selling jeans."
""
"Like we're looking for Fabio."
""
"We got to think differently."
""
"We are the last dog at the bowl."
""
"You see what happens to the runt"
"of the litter? He dies."
""
"Billy, that's a very touching story"
"and everything..."
""
"...but I think we're all very much aware"
"of what we're facing."
""
"You have a lot of experience"
"and wisdom in this room."
""
"You need to have a little faith and"
"let us do the job of replacing Giambi."
""
"Is there another first baseman"
"like Giambi?"
""
"- No, not really."
"- No."
""
"- And if there was, could we afford him?"
"- Nope."
""
"Then what the fuck"
"are you talking about, man?"
""
"If we try to play like the Yankees"
"in here..."
""
"...we will lose to the Yankees"
"out there."
""
"Boy, that sounds like"
"fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy."
""
"- No, that's just logic."
"- Who's Fabio?"
""
"He's a shortstop."
"He's a shortstop from Seattle."
""
"Now, this is no time"
"to push the panic button."
""
"Our scouts will find players,"
"Player Development will develop them."
""
"We'll teach them"
"to play Oakland A baseball."
""
"With all due respect,"
"we've been doing this a long time."
""
"Why don't you just let us"
"be responsible for replacing Giambi..."
""
"...with who we know that can play?"
""
"- Easy power."
"- And loose."
""
"Good face."
""
"This son of a bitch"
"is going in the first round."
""
"You're a premium player, Billy."
""
"You can run, you can field,"
"you can throw, you can hit..."
""
"...you can hit with power."
""
"That doesn't come along very often."
""
"This is Tom Martinez,"
"national cross-checker."
""
"- How you doing? Nice to meet you."
"- Billy Beane."
""
"It's been a while since I've seen"
"a five-tool guy that can do everything."
""
"I'm hopeful your interest"
"in professional baseball..."
""
"...is as strong as ours is gonna be"
"in getting you in this upcoming draft."
""
"Mr. Beane?"
""
"Mark is ready to see you now."
""
"- How you doing?"
"- I'm fine."
""
"- How are you?"
"- Good."
""
"- Hey, Billy."
"- Hey, Mark."
""
"- Good to see you. Please sit down."
"- You too."
""
"- These are the guys. Guys, Billy."
"- Boys."
""
"- How's it going?"
"- All right. How you been?"
""
"- You're filling out that chair nicely."
"- I got three weeks in it right now."
""
"Good, good, man."
""
"- Yeah, man. How you doing?"
"- Fantastic."
""
"- Awesome."
"- Couldn't be better."
""
"That's good to hear."
"I'm not gonna waste your time."
""
"You just tell me"
"what you're looking for."
""
"Fifty million dollars"
"in additional payroll."
""
"You should try Giambi."
""
"I'm sorry. Too soon, right?"
"I want this to be a friendly meeting."
""
"It's not all on your shoulders."
""
"- Where's Steve in this?"
"- Steve's great."
""
"He's supportive"
"in rebuilding this team."
""
"That's what we're gonna do."
""
"- So, what are you looking for?"
"- A left-handed reliever."
""
"I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon."
""
"That's not gonna happen."
""
"Not even a discussion?"
""
"Billy, even if you could afford him,"
"respectfully, we love him."
""
"We're not about to let him go."
""
"You got this Venezuelan kid"
"coming up."
""
"We had him."
"We moved him to Detroit."
""
"What else you thinking?"
""
"Outfielders."
""
"- To replace Damon?"
"- Yeah."
""
"- In your price range? No disrespect."
"- Enough, Mark."
""
"Hollins?"
""
"- García?"
"- No."
""
"Maybe Coste."
""
"That's it."
""
"- All right, tell me about García."
"- To replace Johnny Damon?"
""
"- Mark, is he healthy?"
"- Yeah, he's healthy-ish."
""
"He had that back thing."
""
"- He'll be ready for spring ball."
"- I'll tell you what."
""
"I can give you Guthrie"
"if you kick in some cash."
""
"- Mark Guthrie?"
"- Yeah."
""
"- How much cash?"
"- Two hundred K."
""
"Okay."
""
"- So García's gonna be a no."
"- You're kidding me, right?"
""
"- You're kidding me."
"- I'm not."
""
"Okay. Straight up, García for Guthrie,"
"no kicker."
""
"- No kicker?"
"- Straight up."
""
"I think it's gonna be a hard no"
"on García, but let's just keep going."
""
"- What else you thinking?"
"- What are we doing? Is this business?"
""
"This is the way we do business"
"in Cleveland."
""
"Hey."
""
"- Hello."
"- Who are you?"
""
"I'm Peter Brand."
""
"What do you do?"
""
"I'm special assistant"
"to Mark Shapiro."
""
"So, what do you do?"
""
"Mostly player analysis right now."
""
"Been on the job long?"
"First job in baseball?"
""
"It's my first job anywhere."
""
"- Wow, congrats."
"- Thank you."
""
"First job. Whose nephew are you?"
""
"Why does Mark listen to you?"
""
"I don't think..."
""
"I don't think he does very often."
""
"He just did."
""
"Well, in that circumstance..."
""
"...I think he was more listening"
"to Bruce than myself."
""
"Who are you?"
""
"I'm Peter Brand."
""
"I don't give a rat's ass"
"what your name is."
""
"What happened in there?"
""
"What happened in that room?"
""
"I'm not quite sure"
"what you're asking me, Mr. Beane."
""
"What did you tell Bruce?"
""
"- I just told Bruce I like García."
"- You like García. Why?"
""
"Why?"
""
"I don't know."
""
"There is an epidemic failure"
"within the game..."
""
"...to understand"
"what is really happening."
""
"And this leads people who run"
"Major League Baseball teams..."
""
"...to misjudge their players"
"and mismanage their teams."
""
"I apologize."
""
"Go on."
""
"Okay. People who run ball clubs,"
"they think in terms of buying players."
""
"Your goal shouldn't be to buy players."
"Your goal should be to buy wins."
""
"And in order to buy wins,"
"you need to buy runs."
""
"You're trying"
"to replace Johnny Damon."
""
"The Red Sox see Johnny Damon..."
""
"...and they see a star"
"who's worth $7.5 million a year."
""
"When I see Johnny Damon..."
""
"...what I see is..."
""
"...an imperfect understanding"
"of where runs come from."
""
"The guy's got a great glove."
""
"He's a decent leadoff hitter."
"He can steal bases."
""
"But is he worth the $ 7.5 million"
"a year..."
""
"...that the Boston Red Sox"
"are paying him?"
""
"No. No."
""
"Baseball thinking is medieval."
""
"They are asking"
"all the wrong questions."
""
"And if I say it to anybody,"
"I'm ostracized. I'm a leper."
""
"So that's why I'm cagey"
"about this with you."
""
"That's why..."
""
"I respect you, Mr. Beane,"
"and if you want full disclosure..."
""
"...I think it's a good thing"
"that you got Damon off your payroll."
""
"I think it opens up all kinds"
"of interesting possibilities."
""
"- Where you from, Pete?"
"- Maryland."
""
"- Where'd you go to school?"
"- Yale. I went to Yale."
""
"- What'd you study?"
"- Economics."
""
"I studied economics."
""
"Yale, economics and baseball."
""
"You're funny, Pete."
""
"Tell me, why Billy?"
""
"What is it that makes him special?"
""
"Very rare do you come upon"
"a young man like Billy..."
""
"...who can run, who can field,"
"who can throw, who can hit..."
""
"...and who can hit with power."
""
"Those five tools,"
"you don't see that very often."
""
"Most of the youngsters"
"that we have an interest in..."
""
"...have one or two tools..."
""
"...and we're hoping"
"to develop an extra one."
""
"Your son has five."
""
"We're looking at a guy that's a"
"potential superstar for us in New York."
""
"The time is now to get him started."
""
"We're prepared to make"
"a sizable financial commitment."
""
"The Mets are gonna"
"stand behind Billy..."
""
"...because we expect him"
"to be our big-league center fielder."
""
"This check here"
"represents the offer..."
""
"...that the New York Mets"
"would be making to Billy."
""
"You do know that he's been accepted"
"to Stanford on a full scholarship?"
""
"I do."
""
"So he can do both?"
""
"Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford"
"and professional baseball."
""
"He would have to pick one"
"or the other."
""
"If he wants to be center fielder"
"for the Mets..."
""
"...wants to be a baseball player..."
""
"...he really needs to accept this"
"as life's first occupation, first career."
""
"We're all told at some point we can"
"no longer play the children's game."
""
"We just don't know"
"when that's gonna be."
""
"Some of us are told at 18, some of us"
"are told at 40, but we're all told."
""
"But this is a once-in-a-lifetime"
"opportunity."
""
"We want you badly..."
""
"...and we think that this amount"
"of money expresses that desire."
""
"Billy, this is your decision,"
"and whatever that decision is..."
""
"...you know it's fine"
"with your mother and I."
""
"- Hello?"
"- Hey, it's Billy Beane."
""
"- Hey, what time is it?"
"- I don't know."
""
"Listen, would you have drafted me"
"in the first round?"
""
"What?"
""
"After I left,"
"you looked me up on your computer."
""
"Would you have drafted me"
"in the first round?"
""
"I did, yeah."
"You were a good player."
""
"Cut the crap, man."
""
"Would you have drafted me"
"in the first round?"
""
"I'd have taken you in the ninth round."
"No signing bonus."
""
"I imagine you would've passed"
"and taken that scholarship."
""
"Yeah."
""
"Pack your bags, Pete."
""
"I just bought you"
"from the Cleveland Indians."
""
"- Is it attached to that clamp?"
"- Yeah, let me unhook it."
""
"- Slide it up right there. To the left."
"- I did."
""
"- Yeah, yeah."
"- Hang on, it's wet."
""
"Come on."
""
"- Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on?"
"- Yes."
""
"Great."
""
"- Billy Beane's office."
"- Hey."
""
"- Peter Brand."
"- Billy."
""
"- How are...? Hi, how you doing?"
"- Nice to see you."
""
"Good to have you here."
"Boy, you move in fast."
""
"Yeah, yeah."
"I got here early this morning."
""
"- All moved in."
"- Yeah."
""
"Yeah."
""
"Hey, Billy..."
""
"...I wanted you"
"to see these player evaluations..."
""
"...that you asked me to do."
""
"I asked you to do three."
""
"Yeah."
""
"- To evaluate three players."
"- Yeah."
""
"How many did you do?"
""
"Forty-seven."
""
"Okay."
""
"Actually, 51."
"I don't know why I lied just then."
""
"Why don't you walk me"
"through the board?"
""
"Thank you."
""
"Using this equation"
"in the upper left..."
""
"...I'm projecting that we need to win"
"at least 99 games..."
""
"...in order to make it"
"to the postseason."
""
"We need to score at least 814 runs"
"in order to win those games..."
""
"...and allow no more than 645 runs."
""
"What's this?"
""
"This is a code that I've written"
"for our year-to-year projections."
""
"This is building in the intelligence"
"that we have to project players."
""
"Okay."
""
"It's about getting things down"
"to one number."
""
"Using the stats"
"the way we read them..."
""
"...we'll find value in players"
"that nobody else can see."
""
"People are overlooked..."
""
"...for a variety of biased reasons"
"and perceived flaws."
""
"Age, appearance, personality."
""
"Bill James and mathematics"
"cut straight through that."
""
"Billy, of the 20,000 notable players"
"for us to consider..."
""
"...I believe"
"that there is a championship team..."
""
"...of 25 people that we can afford..."
""
"...because everyone else in baseball"
"undervalues them."
""
"Like an island of misfit toys."
""
"Billy, this is Chad Bradford."
"He's a relief pitcher."
""
"He is one of the most undervalued"
"players in baseball."
""
"His defect is that he throws funny."
""
"Nobody in the big leagues cares"
"about him because he looks funny."
""
"This guy could be not just"
"the best pitcher in our pen..."
""
"...but one of the most effective"
"relief pitchers in all baseball."
""
"This guy should cost $3 million"
"a year."
""
"We can get him for 237,000."
""
"Billy."
""
"- That it?"
"- Yeah."
""
"Hey, Art."
""
"Can I talk to you"
"before you get started?"
""
"- I'm a bit busy right now."
"- I know."
""
"- I know."
"- Okay."
""
"- Morning, everyone."
"- Art."
""
"- Peter Brand. Nice to meet you."
"- Where the hell's Pete?"
""
"That's Pete."
""
"Grab a seat. I'll be right back."
""
"- All right, where did you say he's at?"
"- Okay. He's on..."
""
"- Who's the kid?"
"- A friend of mine."
""
"I can't manage this team"
"under a one-year contract."
""
"Well, sure you can."
""
"No, I can't."
""
"Okay. I gotta put a team on the field."
""
"After that, I'll take a good long look"
"at your contract."
""
"Deal with the manager's contract,"
"then put a team on the field."
""
"At this moment, if a grounder's hit"
"to first, nobody's there to stop it."

"Thanks, Alan."

"I haven't got to see you"

"I wanted to say"
"that New York was heartbreaking."

"I'm sure for you too."
""
"Not many teams make it that far,"
"and to watch you go that far was..."
""
"- It was really an accomplishment."
"- Well, that's nice."

"How is the team shaping up?"
""
"- Team's good. Rebuilding."
"- Good."

"I read you lost Giambonni"
"and Damon."

"- Giambi."
"- Giambi."
""
"- Yeah."
"- Damon, Isringhausen."

"- They're really...? They're gone?"
"- Gone. Yesterday's news."
""
"- That's terrible."
"- No, but that is a tough situation."
""
"That's..."

"You're gonna be fine, though."
"You always figure something out."
""
"Where is she? Where was she?"
"Down the street or...?"
""
"Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her"
"on her cell. She's coming up the hill."
""
"Okay."
""
"She's got a cell phone?"
""
"- Yeah."
"- A 12-year-old?"
""
"Yeah."
""
"For emergencies."
""
"Big parenting decision."

"But it's something that, you know,"
"we, you know, all should discuss..."

"...because if you have any objections,"
"of course..."

"Her mother and I will discuss it."

"But thank you."
""
"Any of these?"

"I don't know."

"- Do you...?"
"- This one's cool."

"- Is that good or bad? Butterflies."
"- They're okay."

"- Look, that one's pretty. I like the red."
"- Should we try?"

"No?"
""
"- Oh, I like this one."
"- Yeah?"

"Dad, look at this one."

"- Look how it's red."

"Can we go over there?"

"Well, honey, I think people would love"
"to listen to you. That's beautiful."

"Would you sing a little for your dad?"

"Right here"
"in the middle of the store?"

"- Little bit."
"- Little bit."
""
"- You ready?"
"- I'm ready."

"Okay."

"Billy Beane was taken"
"in the first round of the amateur draft."
""
"I think this is a steal,"
"to get Billy Beane."

"He's young, he's talented."
""
"A true five-tool player with speed."
"This guy is a can't-miss prospect."

"This is a great sign"

"Ball one."

"I'll take Billy Beane"

"Billy Beane, an interesting pick,"
"turned down a scholarship."

"Sometimes you don't find out"
"till you get to the big leagues..."
""
"This guy has never failed at anything."
"He's coming out of high school."
""
"Billy was gonna go to college."
"He could've been a great quarterback."

"Strike three."

"There's not an organization"
"in baseball..."

"...who would not have taken a chance"
"on this young guy."

"He didn't pan out."
"That happens every year."
""
"Some do, some don't."
""
"I mean, if you're having any doubt"
"at all about this..."
""
"Having the scholarship..."

"Your son was born"
"with a God-given ability."

"Few scouts can go into the mind"
"of a young man..."
""
"...and determine"
"whether he's really confident..."
""
"...about what he can do."
""
"A very special player."
""
"So you can sign him"
"based on his ability..."
""
"...but then he's gotta be successful"
"to be confident."
""
"And once he becomes confident,"
"that's when you've got something."
""
"You make a decision"
"on what you see."
""
"And if things don't pan out,"
"you move on."

"That's baseball."

"They don't have our experience"

"Okay."

"You got a scout here"

"You're listening to the wrong one."

"Now, there are intangibles"

"Adapt or die."

"what's going on?"
""
"- They call it Moneyball."
"- Moneyball?"
""
"Yes, and it was a nice theory,"
"and now it's just not working out."
""
"Billy Beane has built this team"
"on the ideas of a guy, Bill James..."
""
"...who wrote an interesting book"
"on baseball statistics."
""
"The problem is that Bill James"
"never played, never managed."
""
"He was in fact a security guard"
"at a pork-and-beans company."
""
"Do you see this as a decimation"
"of the organization?"
""
"- I think he bought a ticket on the Titanic."
"- Oh, boy."
""
"He's tried to come up"
"with a new approach."
""
"My hat's off to him. It won't work."

"One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out."

"And that is the game."

"The Seattle Mariners"
"win both games on this series, Ray."

"They've won 10 in a row."

"I can't watch this shit."

"You don't go on the road"

"- That's why I want you to do it."
"- Why don't you?"

"I can't develop personal relationships"

"I gotta be able to trade them,"

"Which is something"

"I would never have to cut a player,"
"unless you..."
""
"- Oh, come on."
"- ""Come on"" what?"
""
"- Let's practice."
"- No."
""
"Yeah. I'm a player."
"You gotta cut me from the roster."

"- No."
"- Go."

"- What do you mean, no?"
"- No."

"Part of the job, man."

"Billy, please have a seat."
"I need to talk to you for a minute."

"Go on."

"You've been a huge part"

"I'm sure you can understand."

"I just bought a house here."

"- Well..."

"Well... Well..."

"""Well... Well...""?"
"That's all you got to say?"

"Pete, I gotta let you go."

"That's it?"

"Really?"

"You rather get a bullet to the head or"

"Are those my only two options?"

"Go on the road with the team."

"Okay."
""
"Say, bro."

"- Let me ask you a question."
"- Yeah."

"How come your boss doesn't travel"

"He doesn't like to mingle"
"with the players."

"Is that supposed to make us"

"I don't know. I don't know."

"And how come soda"

"I never seen nothing like that."

"Soda money?"

"So with this loss tonight,"
"the Oakland Athletics..."
""
"...incredibly, have lost 14"

"Well, absolutely. It was predictable."

"You don't wish anybody"
"a lack of success..."
""
"...but the facts are in front of you."
"- You can't blame Art Howe."
""
"- No."
"- The fact of the matter is..."
""
"...this is not about statistics,"
"this is about people."
""
"Art Howe is not the problem."
""
"The problem"
"is in the general manager's office..."
""
"...with Billy Beane."
""
"The root of the problem for me"
"is philosophical."
""
"I said it before."
"This is fantasy baseball."
""
"Billy is just not thinking."
""
"Start thinking about a new GM,"
"making changes."
""
"He never goes to the games."
""
"- This was very predictable."
"- He needs to look at what's going on."
""
"- The man needs to get real."
"- I want Billy Beane gone."
""
"Calling for Beane's head."
"I want your thoughts."
""
"The past 18 games, they've been"
"shut out or scored one run four times."
""
"They're just not scoring enough."
""
"It's not just the offense,"
"not Thad Bosley and the hitters."
""
"It's everything. If there was one thing"
"you could pick out, you'd try to fix it..."

"...but just everything is in a funk"
"right now."
""
"What the hell am I doing?"
""
"Oh, man."

"Look, Steve."

"I believe in what we're doing."
""
"The record doesn't reflect the strength"

"Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly"

"Our sample size has been too small."
"It's too..."
""
"Early. It's still early."
""
"Where do we expect to be"
"by the All-Star break?"
""
"Our goal and our expectation..."

"...is by mid-July"
"to be within seven games of first."
""
"That would be this working."

"- That keeps us in the hunt."
"- Exceptionally well."
""
"- By July."
"- July."

"And what's gonna prevent you"
"from accomplishing that?"

"What are you afraid of?"

"Nothing."
"That's why we're here, Steve."

"That's why we get up in the morning."

"- More?"
"- Yeah, a little more."

"- Don't tell your mother."

"- Chocolate sauce?"

"Stop."

"- Big spoon or little spoon?"
"- Little spoon."

"Thank you."

"Dad, there's no way"

"What?"
""
"- Well, I don't know. I'm just wondering."
"- Where'd you hear that?"
""
"Well, I go on the Internet sometimes."
""
"Well, don't do that."
"Don't go on the Internet."
""
"Or watch TV or read newspapers..."
""
"...or talk to people."
""
"I don't talk to people."
"I just read stuff."
""
"Honey, everything's fine."
"Everything's fine."
""
"Really, you don't have to worry."
""
"But if you lose your job,"
"will you have to move away?"
""
"Honey, I'm not gonna lose my job."
""
"You don't have to worry."
""
"- Okay."
"- Hey."
""
"- There's no problem."
"- Okay."
""
"All right? I got uptown problems,"
"which are not problems at all."
""
"You're not worried, right?"
""
"- No, I'm not worried."
"- Okay."
""
"Peña."
""
"Okay."
""
"I want Dye in right..."
""
"...Justice DH'ing,"
"Peña on the bench..."
""
"...Hatteberg at first..."
""
"...and anyone but Mags"
"first out of the pen."
""
"You want Peña on the bench?"
""
"That's right. So you can play Hattie."
""
"Peña is not only"
"the best first baseman..."
""
"...he's the only first baseman."
""
"Hattie gets on base more than Peña."
""
"- In fact, 20 percent more."
"- And his fielding?"
""
"His fielding does not matter."
""
"- I've heard enough of this."
"- Have you?"
""
"And I..."
""
"I disagree with you,"
"plain and simple."
""
"And moreover,"
"I'm playing my team..."
""
"...in a way that I can explain"
"in job interviews next winter."
""
"Okay?"
""
"Hattie. Not Peña."
""
"What's up, skip?"
""
"- How you doing?"
"- Good, how you doing, man?"
""
"Get some sleep last night?"
""
"As the A's hit the field,"
"we are ready for baseball."
""
"First one out of the dugout"
"is rookie sensation Carlos Peña..."
""
"...one of the few bright lights in this"
"lineup, taking his spot at first base."
""
"Billy, quick question. Do you expect"
"these guys to produce more or...?"
""
"- Not now."
"- What's the reason for the slump?"
""
"Get down."
""
"Is losing fun?"
""
"- Is losing fun?"
"- No."
""
"What are you having fun for?"
""
"That's what losing sounds like."
""
"Are you okay, Dad?"
""
"- You're doing it again."
"- What?"
""
"You're worrying about me."
""
"You're in last place, Dad."
""
"- Do I look worried?"
"- Yeah."
""
"Because you're getting on an airplane,"
"and those things crash all the time."
""
"Please stop worrying"
"about your dad."
""
"- We're all set."
"- Okay."
""
"- I love you."
"- Love you too."
""
"All right. Your dad's not in trouble."
""
"Okay."
""
"Yeah."
""
"- Suzanne, get me Ed Wade."
"- Okay."
""
"- Coffee on?"
"- Yes."
""
"- Good morning."
"- Good morning, Billy."
""
"Oh, hi, Louisa."
""
"- I need Ed Wade for Billy Beane."
"- Hi."
""
"Please hold."
""
"- What's up?"
"- Wade's on 2."
""
"- Ed?"
"- Hello?"
""
"- Ed, it's Billy."
"- Billy, what's up?"
""
"- Look, I need a little help on defense."
"- Okay."
""
"I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi"
"for it."
""
"- Really?"
"- What?"
""
"- Who you got?"
"- What?"
""
"- Well, let me think."
"- What are you doing?"
""
"Cleaning house."
""
"- Mabry?"
"- Maybe what?"
""
"- No, Mabry."
"- Hold on."
""
"- No."
"- Why not?"
""
"Because you can't trade"
"Jeremy Giambi."
""
"He'll be fine, Ed."
""
"Why do I get the feeling"
"you're picking my pocket?"
""
"I'm not. You're picking mine."
"Giambi's name alone is worth more."
""
"- What's wrong with him?"
"- Nothing."
""
"Can we say it's done in theory"
"and start drawing up the paperwork?"
""
"- Okay, but you're gonna have..."
"- Great."
""
"He was gonna say something else."
""
"When you get the answer"
"you're looking for, hang up."
""
"- Suzanne."
"- Yes?"
""
"- David Dombrowski."
"- Okay."
""
"- And Peña's going too."
"- I don't think you should do that."
""
"- I really don't think you should do that."
"- I want Hatteberg in the lineup tonight."
""
"You need to take a minute."
""
"I think you seriously need to think"
"about what you're doing."
""
"- Because you're upset."
"- Okay."
""
"What am I missing?"
""
"These are hard moves"
"to explain to people."
""
"Why is that a problem, Pete?"
""
"Don't make"
"an emotional decision, Billy."
""
"- David Dombrowski's on 3."
"- Look, we're gonna shake things up."
""
"Dave. Peña's going on the block."
"You're my first call."
""
"Because he's making the rest"
"of the team look bad."
""
"He's gonna be a Rookie of the Year."
""
"- Probably an All-Star."
"- He's an All-Star, Dave."
""
"No. I want a reliever and cash."
""
"Okay. You got five minutes, Dave."
"I'm not waiting."
""
"Billy, Peña is an All-Star, okay?"
""
"And if you dump him and this"
"Hatteberg thing doesn't work out..."
""
"...you know this is..."
""
"This is the kind of decision"
"that gets you fired."
""
"It is."
""
"Yes, you're right."
""
"I may lose my job."
""
"In which case I'm a 44-year-old guy"
"with a high school diploma..."
""
"...and a daughter"
"I'd like to be able to send to college."
""
"You're 25 years old,"
"with a degree from Yale..."
""
"...and a pretty impressive"
"apprenticeship."
""
"I don't think"
"we're asking the right question."
""
"I think the question"
"we should be asking is..."
""
"...do you believe in this thing or not?"
""
"I do."
""
"It's a problem you think"
"we need to explain ourselves."
""
"Don't. To anyone."
""
"Okay."
""
"Now, I'm gonna see this thing through,"
"for better or worse."
""
"Just tell me, do you project we'll win"
"more with Hatteberg or Peña at first?"
""
"It's close..."
""
"...but theoretically, Hatteberg."
""
"- What are we talking about, then?"
"- Dombrowski's on again, on 3."
""
"Yeah?"
""
"Okay, that'll work."
""
"Great. I need one more thing."
""
"Soda. Yeah, I don't want my guys"
"paying for soda."
""
"I want you to stock my machine"
"for three years."
""
"I'm serious."
""
"Great. It's a deal."
""
"Go tell Peña he's gotta pack."
""
"- You want me to tell Peña?"
"- Part of the job."
""
"What about Giambi?"
"You want me to tell him too?"
""
"I'll tell him."
""
"- Excuse me, Carlos?"
"- Yeah?"
""
"- Can I speak with you a minute?"
"- Yeah."
""
"Carlos, you've been traded"
"to the Tigers."
""
"This is Jay Palmer's number."
""
"He's the traveling secretary"
"for the team."
""
"He's expecting your call."
"He'll take care of everything."
""
"- Is that it?"
"- Yes."
""
"Okay."
""
"Okay."
""
"Art, you got a minute?"
""
"Yeah. Take a seat."
""
"You can't start Peña at first tonight."
"You'll have to start Hatteberg."
""
"I don't wanna go 15 rounds, Billy."
"The lineup card is mine, and that's all."
""
"That lineup card is definitely yours."
""
"I'm just saying you can't start Peña"
"at first."
""
"Well, I am starting him at first."
""
"I don't think so."
"He plays for Detroit now."
""
"You traded Peña?"
""
"Yeah."
""
"And Menechino, Hiljus, Tam"
"are all being sent down."
""
"- You are outside your mind."
"- Yeah. Cuckoo."
""
"- You wanted to see me?"
"- Yeah, Jeremy, grab a seat."
""
"Jeremy, you've been traded"
"to the Phillies."
""
"This is Ed Wade's number."
"He's a good guy, the GM."
""
"He's expecting your call."
""
"Buddy will help you"
"with the plane flight."
""
"You're a good ballplayer, Jeremy..."
""
"...and we wish you the best."
""
"Jeremy's gone too."
""
"You're killing this team."
""
"Art, I can do this all day long."
""
"Hey."
""
"You agree with this?"
""
"Hundred percent."
""
"You want this door closed?"
""
"- Scotty H."
"- Sir?"
""
"- Go field some grounders."
"- Yes, sir."
""
"Everybody, listen up."
""
"You may not look"
"like a winning team..."
""
"...but you are one."
""
"So play like one tonight."
""
"Oh, shit."
""
"When you're getting your pitch,"
"you're hitting .625, massive."
""
"You're crushing the ball."
""
"But when you swing at things..."
"Your pitch is middle-in."
""
"When you're swinging low and away,"
"you're batting .158."
""
"Every at bat's"
"like a hand of blackjack."
""
"Every card that's dealt,"
"your odds change."
""
"So every first-pitch strike, your batting"
"average goes down about 75 points."
""
"Seventy-five points."
""
"He should throw 100 pitches"
"before the fifth."
""
"You wanna knock that starter out."
""
"I want you taking at bats off the 10th"
"and 11 th pitcher by the end."
""
"This is your basic breakdown"
"of the pitches..."
""
"...where you should be hitting them,"
"why."
""
"- So you want us to walk more?"
"- Good question. Yes."
""
"Mr. Justice."
""
"- Had a few thoughts."
"- Yeah?"
""
"- Yeah."
"- Gonna teach me some things?"
""
"Excuse me?"
""
"Never seen a GM talk to players"
"like that."
""
"You never seen a GM"
"who was a player."
""
"- We got a problem, David?"
"- No, it's okay."
""
"I know your routine."
""
"It's patter. It's for effect."
""
"But it's for them, all right?"
"That shit ain't for me."
""
"Oh, you're special?"
""
"You're paying me 7 million bucks"
"a year, man, so, yeah..."
""
"...maybe I am, a little bit."
""
"No, man, I ain't paying you 7."
""
"Yankees are paying half your salary."
""
"That's what the New York Yankees"
"think of you."
""
"They're paying you $3.5 million"
"to play against them."
""
"Where you going with this, Billy?"
""
"David, you're 37."
""
"How about you and I be honest about"
"what each of us want out of this?"
""
"I wanna milk the last ounce of baseball"
"you got in you."
""
"And you wanna stay in the show."
""
"Let's do that."
""
"I'm not paying you"
"for the player you used to be."
""
"I'm paying you for the player you are"
"right now."
""
"You're smart."
"You get what we're trying to do here."
""
"Make an example"
"for the younger guys."
""
"Be a leader."
""
"Can you do that?"
""
"All right. I got you."
""
"We're cool?"
""
"We're cool."
""
"Scotty H."
""
"- Yo, what's up, D.J.?"
"- Picking machine."
""
"How you liking first base, man?"
""
"It's coming along. Picking it up."
""
"You know, tough transition,"
"but I'm starting to feel better with it."
""
"- Yeah?"
"- Yeah."
""
"What's your biggest fear?"
""
"A baseball being hit"
"in my general direction."
""
"That's funny. Seriously, what is it?"
""
"No, seriously, that is."
""
"Well, hey, good luck with that."
""
"Be social out there."
""
"- Social."
"- Social. Like a greeter at the Gap."
""
"Guy steps into your office,"
"chat him up."
""
"You're well-read."
"You went to school."
""
"- Yeah."
"- Have some fun. Relax."
""
"Everyone wants to attack."
"Quit trying to attack."
""
"Let the game come to you, man."
"There's no clock on this thing."
""
"This is a war of attrition."
""
"If I take more, I could even take"
"a few strikes, but I'll get walked more."
""
"You get on base, we win."
"You don't, we lose."
""
"And I hate losing, Chavvie. I hate it."
""
"I hate losing"
"more than I even wanna win."
""
"And there's a difference."
""
"- No bunts."
"- Bunts is an out."
""
"- Even if the third baseman is back?"
"- No bunting whatsoever."
""
"If someone bunts on us,"
"throw it to first."
""
"Don't be a hero and go to second."
""
"Let them make the mistakes."
""
"When your enemy's making mistakes,"
"don't interrupt them."
""
"They're giving you an out."
"Just giving it to you."
""
"Take it. Say thank you."
""
"Another thing. No more stealing."
""
"That's what I do,"
"what you pay me to do."
""
"I pay you to get on first,"
"not get thrown out at second."
""
"This is a process."
"It's a process, it's a process. Okay?"
""
"Jason takes it, goes to second"
"for the only out, and the A's get a run."
""
"Jermaine Dye homers again,"
"his second in two games."
""
"And the A's are still hanging in."
"We'll get you scores here."
""
"The A's pull within two"
"of the Angels for the wild-card chase."
""
"The Reds have now dropped"
"five in a row..."
""
"...as Oakland beats them"
"in the beginning of this series 5 to 3."
""
"Tejada walks."
""
"Ball four."
""
"Ball four and Hatteberg walks."
""
"What is happening in Oakland?"
"The A's have won seven in a row."
""
"A lot of excitement."
"What a winning streak."
""
"But how about the calming influence"
"of Art Howe?"
""
"When you say ""your source,"""
"if it's not me or Peter, they don't know."
""
"He's managing"
"an unorthodox team."
""
"- Right."
"- It's not a perfect roster."
""
"But right now, Art Howe is the reason"
"this team is winning."
""
"- He deserves the credit."
"- Great, thanks. Bye."
""
"Did you hear that?"
""
"I heard ""seven in a row."""
"You get the Cleveland matchups?"
""
"Yeah, right here."
""
"- Voos."
"- Billy."
""
"- That smell is getting worse."
"- I'm on it."
""
"- What are we doing?"
"- Splitting it in half?"
""
"- Both sides of the plate."
"- Got it."
""
"- Huddy. Mix it up."
"- Yes, sir."
""
"- Trust your slider, yeah?"
"- Yes, sir."
""
"You guys quit distracting him."
""
"You couldn't hit that shit last night"
"with a paddle."
""
"You gotta see more pitches."
""
"- All right, Billy."
"- Patience."
""
"- Hey, David."
"- Hey, Billy."
""
"- Great at bats."
"- Thank you."
""
"- Really quality."
"- Thank you."
""
"Base hit to right field."
"Tejada scores."
""
"Chavez coming in."
"The ball gets past Guiel."
""
"The A's, from 5-nothing down,"
"now lead 6 to 5."
""
"The Oakland A's are completely"
"out of hand at the moment."
""
"They are an AL-best 17 and 4"
"this month."
""
"They also took back-to-back series"
"at Boston and at New York."
""
"Remember when they traded"
"Jeremy Giambi in June..."
""
"...and everyone thought"
"they'd just given up?"
""
"Actually, not so much."
""
"Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone."
""
"- You thinking Rincon?"
"- His season's done. He's lost faith."
""
"- I think he's gonna dump him."
"- Hard-core."
""
"Shapiro on 2."
""
"Mark, Billy. Let's be honest."
""
"A premier setup man isn't"
"gonna get you closer to the play-offs."
""
"- Are you referring to Rincon?"
"- He's a luxury you can't afford, man."
""
"And you can?"
"There's half a million on his contract."
""
"And we've got"
"at least one other suitor."
""
"By ""at least one,"" you mean one."
""
"- Who is it?"
"- I'd rather not say."
""
"- San Francisco."
"- San Francisco."
""
"I'll call you back."
""
"What do you think we can get"
"for Magnante?"
""
"Nothing."
""
"- What's left on Venafro's contract?"
"- Two seventy-five."
""
"Suzanne,"

"Get the Giants interested in Venafro,"
"Mark's only got one buyer for Rincon."
""
"- Us."
"- On 3."
""
"Saby-Sabster, it's Billy."
"What do you think of Venafro?"
""
"I can let you have him"
"for almost nothing."
""
"- Why would you do that?"
"- Because I'm amazing."
""
"I want a couple bucks"
"and a sweetener."
""
"Throw in, say..."
""
"- Anderson."
"- Anderson."
""
"- I like Anderson."
"- No, you don't. Nobody likes him."
""
"I don't know why I'm doing this."
"But let's do it."
""
"Venafro for Michaelson. Anderson."
"I don't know his name."
""
"- I'll think about it."
"- Think about it and call me back."
""
"Get Shapiro on."
""
"Shapiro's on 2."
""
"- Mark."
"- You can't afford him, Billy."
""
"You sure about that?"
""
"I get the impression"
"the market for Rincon is softening."
""
"I could be wrong,"
"but I'd call whoever's interested..."
""
"...and see if they're still interested."
"Call me back."
""
"- What about the Mets for Venafro?"
"- You offered him to the Giants."
""
"Suzanne, Steve Phillips."
""
"Between Bonds, Kent, Nen, Snow,"
"San Francisco's never gonna do it."
""
"- Totally agree."
"- We just need them to cool on Rincon."
""
"- Phillips on 2."
"- Steve-o, it's Billy."
""
"I hear you're looking for a reliever."
"I can give you Venafro."
""
"- I can make it quick and easy."
"- What's the angle?"
""
"- No angle."
"- Who am I getting fleeced for?"
""
"- Hang on a sec."
"- Bennett, maybe?"
""
"- How old?"
"- Twenty-six."
""
"Twenty-six, Double-A? Forget it."
""
"Duncan, no."
""
"No. Furbush, no."
""
"Eckerton? Eckerton? Eckerton."

"- Eckerton."
"- Eckerton? I like Eckerton."
""
"- You don't even know who Eckerton is."
"- Is Venafro hurt?"
""
"No, he's fine, he's fine."
"It's just an issue for us."
""
"- Last couple times, he got hammered."
"- Not his fault."
""
"- That was us. We misused him."
"- It's Steve."
""
"- I'm almost done."
"- Steve Schott."
""
"Look, Steve-o,"
"let me be straight with you."
""
"Here's the deal."
"I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal."
""
"- I heard the Giants..."
"- Giants want Venafro for Michaelson."
""
"- Anderson."
"- I'd rather deal with you."
""
"You can give me Eckerton"
"and $225,000 in cash..."
""
"...and the Giants can't."
""
"- I'll think about it."
"- Think about it."
""
"But whoever calls me back first"
"gets Venafro."
""
"Schott hung up."

"Oh, I want this one."
""
"Why isn't anybody calling?"
""
"Shapiro's on 2."
""
"Yeah?"
""
"Okay, let me talk to my owner."
"I'll call you back."
""
"- Get Steve on the phone."
"- Schott or Phillips?"
""
"Why would we call Phillips?"
"Phillips has gotta call us."
""
"Tell him I'm on the other line."
""
"Hi, Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand."
"I apologize for putting you on hold."
""
"- Billy asked me to call you back."
"- Tell him we want $225,000 for Rincon."
""
"Billy says he needs $225,000"
"for Ricardo Rincon."
""
"Please."
""
"Yes, I added the ""please"" at the end."
""
"Okay. Let me..."
"Hold on one second, please."
""
"Tell him I'll pay for him."
""
"But when I sell him back for twice the"
"amount next year, I keep the money."
""
"Okay, so Billy says"
"he'll pay for Rincon himself."
""
"But when he sells him for more money"
"next year, he's keeping the profit."
""
"Thank you very much."
"We'll call you back. Thank you."
""
"Come on. Come on."
""
"Suzanne, call Shapiro ba..."
"Never mind, I got him right here."
""
"Mark. Yeah."
""
"Listen, I don't want Rincon"
"pitching against me tonight."
""
"Tell him to change clothes and"
"send him over. I got you the money."
""
"Yup."
""
"Great."
""
"I don't wanna dampen the mood at all,"
"but since we picked up Rincon..."
""
"We gotta send someone down."
""
"- Mags."
"- Hey, Billy."
""
"I know I've been struggling lately."
""
"But second half of the season,"
"definitely turn it around. Ricky and I..."
""
"Mike, I need you"
"to stop getting dressed."
""
"Traded?"
""
"I'm sorry for the crap news."
""
"I know it hurts."
""
"Mike, I can't have 26 guys"
"in the clubhouse."
""
"I get it. I get it."
""
"Okay. Thanks."
""
"Hey, Ricardo."
""
"This must be a bit of a shock,"
"I guess."
""
"Mabry hits one"
"deep to right-center field."
""
"Racing back, Fick can't get it."
""
"It bounces to the wall."
"One run is in. Two runs are in."
""
"Mabry, on one pitch,"
"has shot the A's in front."
""
"Strike three called."
"Twelve straight wins for the Athletics."
""
"Man alive, was it hairy."
""
"Something strange is now happening"
"in Oakland."
""
"- You cannot argue that point."
"- Twelve straight."
""
"They're making a joke"
"out of the American League."
""
"- They were in Detroit today..."
"- He throws to first."
""
"And that's the sound"
"of 14 straight victories."
""
"Fourteen, the longest run this year."
""
"It has slingshot the A's into first"
"in the AL West."
""
"- A nice streak."
"- This team was written off."
""
"How do you explain, otherwise,"
"the victories they've come up with?"
""
"The Oakland A's are gonna win"
"16 consecutive games."
""
"This is the longest win streak"
"in baseball, folks, in 25 years."
""
"- The A's have won 16 in a row."
"- We're going to 20! We're going to 20!"
""
"To have a winning streak of"
"this duration, you have to be good..."
""
"...but there's an element"
"of randomness to it."
""
"The 1927 Yankees, Ruth, Gehrig..."
""
"...Murderers' Row, some people"
"still say the best team ever."
""
"Longest winning streak"
"for them that year? Nine."
""
"You guys try to analyze it"
"from a numbers standpoint."
""
"I'm telling you, there is no explanation"
"for what's occurring right now."
""
"Do you have superstitions"
"going on?"
""
"Do you do things"
"so you keep the streak alive?"
""
"The all-time record of 20"
"does not seem impossible anymore."
""
"The A's were on page one"
"of the New York Times."
""
"They are the story in sports"
"in this entire country."
""
"Two-two pitch, here it is."
""
"Swing and a miss! Struck him out!"
"Number 17!"
""
"It's taken 71 years."
""
"The Oakland A's"
"have tied the Philadelphia A's."
""
"The all-time franchise record"
"17 straight..."
""
"...and baseball's longest"
"winning streak since 1953."
""
"The A's are two wins away from"
"tying the American League record."
""
"It's gone! It's gone!"
"Tejada wins it! Do you believe it?"
""
"Eighteen wins in a row!"
""
"You could replay these 18 games"
"a hundred times over."
""
"And nobody wins 18 straight again."
""
"It defies everything we know"
"about baseball."
""
"The most amazing thing"
"you could imagine..."
""
"...happened over the last four days"
"at the Coliseum."
""
"Tejada, up the middle."
"The A's have won 19 in a row!"
""
"The 1906 White Sox..."
""
"...the 1947 New York Yankees"
"have company."
""
"- Nineteen in a row."
"- The A's have a date with destiny."
""
"They're going for the all-time"
"American League record..."
""
"...20 games in a row."
""
"We're going to 20!"
""
"We're gonna take the AL record"
"to 20, baby!"
""
"Don't tell me the score, Pete."
""
"No, Billy, it's me."
""
"- Sharon?"
"- Yeah."
""
"- You have a second?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
""
"Well, I didn't actually expect you"
"to pick up."
""
"I was gonna leave a message."
""
"Casey and I, we're here"
"and watching the game at home."
""
"And I just wanted to say..."
""
"...you did good, Billy."
""
"We're really proud of you."
""
"I appreciate it, Sharon."
""
"- Thank you."
"- Good luck."
""
"Okay."
""
"Oh, Casey wants to talk to you."
"Hang on."
""
"Hey are you on your way"
"to the stadium?"
""
"No, I'm on my way to Visalia"
"to see our minor-league team."
""
"- Turn around, please, Dad."
"- No way, Jose."
""
"- Turn around. Come on, Dad."
"- Nope. Not gonna happen."
""
"You're not gonna jinx it."
""
"I'll talk to you later, sweetheart."
"I love you."
""
"Shit."
""
"One out here in the fourth,"
"and if you're just joining us..."
""
"...you missed a lot."
""
"And the pitch to Raúl Ibañez."
"Strike one."
""
"I think my recap will be simple."
""
"The A's scored six in the first,"
"one in the second, four in the third."
""
"And people would be shocked"
"if you just did that."
""
"Eleven to nothing, the A's do lead."
""
"- Shit."
"- Foul off the foot of Ibañez..."
""
"Let's go, Oakland!"
""
"Let's go, Oakland!"
""
"Let's go, Oakland!"
""
"Now batting, number 2,"
"catcher, Brent Mayne."
""
"- Oakland!"
"- Here we go, Oakland!"
""
"Two."
""
"Safe."
""
"Now batting, number 18..."
""
"...left fielder Raúl Ibañez."
""
"Safe."
""
"And the A's now lead by a score"
"of 11 to 3."
""
"A nice cushion,"
"but you don't wanna give teams life..."
""
"...and let them wedge their way"
"back in, even when you're..."
""
"Nobody out, the bases loaded."
""
"And Art Howe on the way to the"
"mound to make a pitching change."
""
"And this game is still in a state..."
""
"...where it could get out of control"
"for the Athletics."
""
"We're all told at some point we can"
"no longer play the children's game."
""
"We just don't know"
"when that's gonna be."
""
"Some of us are told at 18, some of us"
"are told at 40, but we're all told."
""
"Mike Sweeney with runners"
"at first and third."
""
"It's an 11-to-7 game,"
"the A's in front."
""
"Tam peering in for the sign."
""
"Two out. Runners at first and third."
""
"And the 3-2 delivery."
""
"It's weird, Billy."
""
"You wanna give up baseball"
"to become a scout?"
""
"I'm not a baseball player."
""
"Are you sure this is what you want?"
""
"The crowd is roaring."
"Koch is ready. One-two pitch."
""
"Alicea puts it in play,"
"a looper to left field for a base hit."
""
"Around third, tearing for the plate,"
"here comes the tying run."
""
"Sliding safe."
"And the ball game is tied at 11-all."
""
"Holy Toledo."
""
"The A's have blown"
"an 11-to-nothing lead."
""
"This is the specter of a development"
"that has been lurking now..."
""
"...ever since the five-run fourth inning"
"by the Royals."
""
"And the A's date with destiny"
"is on hold right now."
""
"Hatteberg. Hattie."
""
"Grab a bat."
"You're hitting for Byrnesy."
""
"Come on, let's go."
"Get yourself loose."
""
"Hitting for Eric Byrnes..."
""
"...number 10, Scott Hatteberg."
""
"In your typical A's fashion,"
"they want a base runner here."
""
"Scott Hatteberg is so adept"
"at drawing walks."
""
"He's looking for Hatteberg"
"to get on base..."
""
"...maybe bring in a pinch runner."
""
"Let's go, Oakland!"
""
"Let's go, Oakland!"
""
"That one is gone!"
""
"And it's 20 consecutive victories"
"for the Oakland Athletics..."
""
"...on an unbelievable night..."
""
"...when they lost"
"an 11-to-nothing lead..."
""
"...and now they win it."
""
"The crowd comes back"
"to insane life."
""
"How do you explain it?"
""
"Crazy. Just plain crazy."
""
"Hatteberg is mobbed at home plate."
""
"In 103 years"
"of American League baseball..."
""
"...the Athletics have accomplished"
"what no one has before."
""
"They have won"
"20 consecutive games."
""
"It's hard not to be romantic"
"about baseball."
""
"This kind of thing,"
"it's fun for the fans."
""
"It sells tickets and hot dogs."
""
"Doesn't mean anything."
""
"Billy, we just won 20 games"
"in a row."
""
"And what's the point?"
""
"We just got the record."
""
"Man, I've been doing this for..."
""
"Listen, man."
""
"I've been in this game a long time."
""
"I'm not in it for a record,"
"I'll tell you that."
""
"I'm not in it for a ring."
""
"That's when people get hurt."
""
"If we don't win the last game"
"of the Series..."
""
"...they'll dismiss us."
""
"- Billy..."
"- I know these guys."
""
"I know the way they think,"
"and they will erase us."
""
"And everything we've done here..."
""
"...none of it'll matter."
""
"Any other team wins the World Series,"
"good for them."
""
"They're drinking champagne,"
"they get a ring."
""
"But if we win..."
""
"...on our budget, with this team..."
""
"...we'll have changed the game."
""
"And that's what I want."
""
"I want it to mean something."
""
"The A's going to the play-offs"
"with the West Division title."
""
"Forgive the A's"
"if they're not celebrating."
""
"They have been here before..."
""
"...when Oakland went up two games"
"to none on the Yanks in the ALDS..."
""
"...and went nowhere"
"after losing three straight."
""
"With a win today over the Twins,"
"Oakland moves into the ALCS..."
""
"...for the first time since 1992."
"- But remember one thing."
""
"Percentages hold up over a season,"
"but for one game, one at bat..."
""
"...throw the percentages"
"out the window."
""
"What the Minnesota Twins exposed"
"is the fact that the Oakland A's..."
""
"...were fundamentally"
"not a sound baseball team."
""
"They had a flawed concept that"
"started with the general manager..."
""
"...and the brain trust"
"thinking they could reinvent baseball."
""
"You can't approach baseball..."
""
"...from a statistical,"
"bean-counting point of view."
""
"It's won on the field"
"with fundamental play."
""
"You have to steal, you have to bunt,"
"you have to sacrifice."
""
"You gotta get men in scoring position,"
"and you gotta bring them in."
""
"And you don't do that"
"with a bunch of statistical gimmicks."
""
"Nobody reinvents this game."
""
"Yeah."
""
"Due respect to the Coliseum,"
"but this is a ballpark."
""
"Yes, it is."
""
"We're gonna have some lunch"
"in a little bit."
""
"Why don't I have some coffee"
"sent up?"
""
"Denise?"
""
"Thank you, Denise."
""
"- Thanks."
"- You're welcome."
""
"You know, it's her birthday"
"and I need to get her a present..."
""
"...but she's usually the one"
"that does that for me."
""
"So do you have any ideas?"
""
"Scarf."
""
"You mean like wool?"
""
"No, I meant what women wear with..."
"You know, decorative."
""
"And where would I get something"
"like that?"
""
"No disrespect, I just lost in five"
"for the second year in a row."
""
"Get her a bowling ball for all I care."
""
"Right."
""
"Well, Steve told me he's offering you"
"a new contract."
""
"Yes."
""
"So why did you return my call?"
""
"Because it's the Red Sox."
""
"Because I believe science might offer"
"an answer to the Curse of the Bambino."
""
"- Because I hear you hired Bill James."
"- Yup."
""
"You know, why someone took so long"
"to hire that guy is beyond me."
""
"Well, baseball hates him."
""
"Well, baseball can hate him,"
"you know."
""
"One of the great things about money"
"is that it buys a lot of things..."
""
"...one of which is the luxury"
"to disregard what baseball likes..."
""
"...doesn't like, what baseball thinks,"
"doesn't think."
""
"Sounds nice."
""
"Well, I was grateful for the call."
""
"- You were grateful?"
"- Yeah."
""
"For 41 million,"
"you built a play-off team."
""
"You lost Damon, Giambi,"
"Isringhausen, Peña..."
""
"...and you won more games"
"without them than you did with them."
""
"You won the exact same number"
"of games that the Yankees won..."
""
"...but the Yankees spent 1.4 million"
"per win..."
""
"...and you paid 260,000."
""
"I know you're taking it in the teeth,"
"but the first guy through the wall..."
""
"...he always gets bloody."
""
"Always. This is threatening"
"not just a way of doing business..."
""
"...but in their minds,"
