"Eleanor?"

"Come on in."
""
"Hi, Eleanor. I'm Michael."
""
"How are you today?"
""
"I'm great."
""
"Thanks for asking."
""
"Oh, one question."
""
"Where am I? Who are you?"
"And what's going on?"
""
"Right, so,"
""
"you, Eleanor Shellstrop,"
""
""
""
""
""
"are dead."
""
"Your life on Earth has ended,"
""
"and you are now in the next phase"
""
"of your existence in the universe."
""
"Cool."
""
"Cool. I have some questions."
""
"Thought you might."
""
"How did I die?"
""
"I-I don't remember."
""
"Yes, um,"
""
"in cases of traumatic"
"or embarrassing deaths,"
""
"we erase the memory to allow"
"for a peaceful transition."
""
"Are you sure you want to hear?"
""
"All right, so you were"
"in a grocery store parking lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"You dropped a bottle of something called"
""
"""Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One."""
""
"And when you bent down to pick it up,"
""
"a long column of shopping carts"
""
"that were being returned to the"
"shopping cart collection area"
""
"rolled out of control"
"and plowed right into you."
""
"Oof."
""
"That's how I died?"
""
"No, sorry, there's more."
""
"You were able to grab on"
""
"to the front of the column"
"of shopping carts,"
""
"but it swept you"
"right out into the street"
""
"where you were struck and killed"
""
"by a mobile billboard truck advertising"
""
"an erectile dysfunction pill"
"called ""Engorge-ulate."""
""
"Funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive"
""
"was an ex-boyfriend of yours..."
""
"Okay, that's... I get it, thank you."
""
"Oh, okay, sorry."
""
"Um, so who was right?"
""
"I mean about all of this?"
""
"Well, let's see."
"Hindus are a little bit right,"
""
"Muslims a little bit."
""
"Jews, Christians, Buddhists,"
""
"every religion guessed about 5%,"
""
"except for Doug Forcett."
""
"Who... who's Doug Forcett?"
""
"Well, Doug was a stoner kid"
""
"who lived in Calgary during the 1970s."
""
"One night, he got"
"really high on mushrooms,"
""
"and his best friend, Randy, said,"
""
"""Hey, what do you think"
"happens after we die?"""
""
"And Doug just launched"
"into this long monologue"
""
"where he got like 92% correct."
""
"I mean, we couldn't believe"
"what we were hearing."
""
"That's him, actually, right up there."
""
"He's pretty famous around here."
""
"I'm very lucky to have that."
""
"So..."
""
"Maybe my biggest question:"
""
"am I..."
""
"I mean, is this..."
""
"Or..."
""
"Well, it's not the"
""
"heaven or hell idea"
"that you were raised on."
""
"But generally speaking,"
""
"in the afterlife, there's a Good Place"
""
"and there's a Bad Place."
""
"You're in the Good Place."
""
"You're okay, Eleanor."
""
"You're in the Good Place."
""
"Well, that's good."
""
"Sure is."
""
"Okay, let's take a walk, shall we?"
""
"Oh, did I have a purse?"
""
"No, I'm dead, right. Okay."
""
"Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx"
"www.addic7ed.com"
""
"So this is how it works."
""
"The Good Place is divided"
"into distinct neighborhoods."
""
"Each one contains exactly 322 people"
""
"who have been perfectly selected"
""
"to blend together into"
"a blissful harmonic balance."
""
"Do all the neighborhoods look like this?"
""
"No, every neighborhood is unique."
""
"Some have warm weather, some cold."
""
"Some are cities, some farmland."
""
"But in each one, every blade of grass,"
""
"every ladybug,"
""
"every detail has been"
""
"precisely designed and calibrated"
""
"for its residents."
""
"There's a lot of frozen yogurt places."
""
"Yeah."
""
"That's the one thing we put"
"in all the neighborhoods."
""
"People love frozen yogurt."
""
"I don't know what to tell you."
""
"You're gonna have a million"
"more questions, I know."
""
"For right now,"
""
"better grab a seat."
""
"Movie's about to begin."
""
"- Ah. Hello, everyone."
"- _"
""
"And welcome to your first day"
"in the afterlife."
""
"You were all, simply put, good people."
""
"But how do we know that you were good?"
""
"How are we sure?"
""
"- During your time on Earth,"
"- _"
""
"every one of your actions"
""
"had a positive or a negative value,"
""
"depending on how much good or bad"
""
"that action put into the universe."
""
"- Every sandwich you ate,"
"- _"
""
"- every time you bought a magazine,"
"- _"
""
"every single thing you did"
""
"had an effect that rippled out over time"
""
"and ultimately created"
"some amount of good or bad."
""
"You know how some people"
"pull into the breakdown lane"
""
"when there's traffic?"
""
"And they think to themselves,"
""
"""Ah, who cares? No one's watching."""
""
"We were watching."

"Surprise."
""
"Anyway, when your time"
"on Earth has ended,"
""
"we calculate"
"the total value of your life"
""
"using our perfectly accurate"
"measuring system."
""
"Only the people"
"with the very highest scores,"
""
"the true cream of the crop,"
""
"get to come here, to the Good Place."
""
"What happens to everyone else, you ask?"
""
"Don't worry about it."
""
"The point is, you are here"
"because you lived"
""
"one of the very best lives"
""
"that could be lived."
""
"And you won't be alone."
""
"Your true soul mate is here too."
""
"That's right."
""
"Soul mates are real."
""
"One of the other people"
"in your neighborhood"

"is your actual soul mate,"

"and you will spend eternity together."

"So welcome to eternal happiness."

"Welcome to the Good Place."
""
"Sponsored by:"
""
"otters holding hands while they sleep."
""
"You know the way you feel when you see"
""
"a picture of two otters holding hands?"
""
"That's how you're gonna feel every day."
""
"So who is in the Bad Place,"
"that would shock me?"
""
"Uh, well, Mozart,"
""
"Picasso, Elvis,"
""
"basically every artist ever,"
""
"uh, every U.S. president except Lincoln."
""
"That sounds about right."
""
"What about Florence Nightingale?"
""
"That was close,"
"but, no, she didn't make it."
""
"Wow, all those amazing people"
""
"down there, it just seems"
"so hard to believe."
""
"Again, it's an incredibly"
"selective system."
""
"Most people don't make it here."
""
"But you, a lawyer who got"
"innocent people off death row,"
""
"you're special, Eleanor."
""
"And by the way,"
""
"welcome to your new home."
""
"Oh, it's perfect, isn't it?"
""
"You see, in the Good Place,"
""
"every person gets to live in a home"
""
"that perfectly matches"
"his or her true essence."
""
"Cool."
""
"So I guess that's why"
"my house, for example,"
""
"is this adorable little cottage,"
""
"whereas other people might"
"have homes that are bigger,"
""
"like that one."
""
"Exactly."
""
"Oh, I'm so happy you get it."
""
"As you can see, the interior has been"
""
"decorated just as you like it,"
""
"in the Icelandic primitive style."
""
"Oh, oh, and, uh, of course,"
""
"you love clowns, so..."
""
"I do love clowns."
""
"Now, let me show you the, uh..."
""
"the video system here."
""
"You can review everything"
"that happened in your life"
""
"from your point of view."
""
"There we go."
""
"This is your Human Rights"
"mission to the Ukraine."
""
"I mean, you got"
"a ton of points for that one."

"It really put you over the top."

"Oh."

"Chidi, come on in."
""
"Eleanor?"
""
"I'm Chidi Anagonye,"

"and you are my soul mate."
""
"Cool, bring it in, man."
""
"Now, excuse me."
""
"I have other people to attend to."
""
"So where you from, Chidi?"
""
"Well, I was born in Nigeria,"
""
"raised in Senegal,"
""
"but my work took me"
"all over the place..."
""
"Australia, Hong Kong, Paris."
""
"What about you?"
""
"Uh, well, I... I was born in Phoenix."
""
"- Mm-hmm."
"- Arizona."
""
"And then I went to school"
"in Tempe, Arizona."
""
"And then I moved back"
"to Phoenix, Arizona."
""
"Your English is amazing."
""
"Oh!"
""
"I'm actually speaking French."
""
"This place just translates"
"whatever you say"
""
"into a language"
"the other person can understand."
""
"- So it's incredible."
"- Whoa."
""
"And now I want to say this."
""
"Mm-kay."
""
"Eleanor."
""
"I have spent my entire life"
""
"in pursuit of fundamental truths"
"about the universe."
""
"And now we can actually learn about them"

"together as soul mates."

"It's overwhelming."
""
"Chidi."

"You'll stand by my side"
"no matter what, right?"
""
"Of course I will."
""
"Promise me. Say, ""I promise"

"I will never betray you for any reason."""
""
"Eleanor, I swear"
""
"that I will never say or do anything"
""
"to cause you any harm."
""
"Good."
""
"Because those aren't my memories."
""
"I wasn't a lawyer."
"I never went to the Ukraine."
""
"I hate clowns."
""
"There's been a big mistake."
""
"I'm not supposed to be here."
""
"Wait, what?"
""
"Stop terrorism! Boycott the source."
"Join HumanGuardians.com. It’s free."
""
"Are you sure this isn't you?"
""
"Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure"
""
"I wasn't a death row lawyer"
""
"who collected clown paintings"
""
"and rescued orphans."
""
"They got my name right,"
"but nothing else."
""
"I mean, somebody royally forked up."
""
"Somebody forked up."
""
"Why can't I say ""fork""?"
""
"If you're trying to curse,"
"you can't here."
""
"I guess a lot of people"
"in this neighborhood"
""
"don't like it, so it's prohibited."
""
"That's bullshirt."
""
"So, uh, if you're not this person,"
""
"then who are you?"
""
"What did you do for a living?"
""
"I was... in..."
""
"sales."
""
"So we sell two products here,"
""
"NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver."
""
"We aim this at seniors."
""
"Now, you can't legally call it medicine"
""
"because it doesn't technically work"
""
"and it is technically chalk,"
""
"so what you're gonna want to do..."
""
"You need me to lie to old people"
""
"and scare them"
"into buying fake medicine."
""
"I get it, man. Which one's my desk?"
""
"So your job"
""
"was to defraud the elderly?"
""
"Sorry... the sick and elderly?"
""
"But I was very good at it."
""
"I was the top salesperson"
"five years running."
""
"Okay, but that's worse."
""
"I mean, you... you do get"
"how that's worse?"
""
"- Right?"
"- Mm."
""
"You know, maybe..."
""
"it's a test."
""
"Maybe if you go to Michael"
""
"and you tell him the truth,"
""
"you'll pass the test"
""
"and you'll get to stay."
""
"No way."
""
"I can't risk going to the Bad Place."
""
"Okay, well, maybe"
"it's not actually, like,"
""
"all that bad."
""
"Let's just get some information first."
""
"We'll ask Janet. Hey, Janet?"
""
"- Hi there."
"- Gah!"
""
"How can I help you?"
""
"What the fork? Who are you?"
""
"I'm Janet."
""
"I'm the informational assistant"
"here in the Good Place."
""
"She's like this walking database."
""
"You can ask her about"
""
"the creation of the universe"
"or history..."
""
"Oh, there was a guy who lived"
""
"in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002."
""
"His name was Kevin Paltonic."
""
"- Is he gay?"
"- No."
""
"Really? Huh."
""
"I guess he just didn't want"
"to have sex with me."
""
"That's correct."
""
"Well, that's fine,"
"I wasn't that into him anyway."
""
"- Yes, you were."
"- Okay, Janet,"
""
"- I have a question."
"- Okay."
""
"What is the Bad Place like?"
""
"Oh, sorry, that is the one topic"
""
"I'm not allowed to tell you about."
""
"I can only play you a brief audio clip"
""
"of what is happening there right now."
""
"Okay."
""
"The bear has two mouths!"
""
"Well, it doesn't sound awesome."
""
"Does everyone have"
"a huge house except me?"
""
"All right, we need a plan."
""
"I say we just lie low"
""
"and hope that they don't notice me."
""
"I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you."
""
"I just don't like being dishonest,"
""
"and I can't advise you"
"to be dishonest either."
""
"Come on, I'm just asking"
"you to fudge a little bit."
""
"You must've told a few"
"white lies in your life."
""
"I mean, what was your job?"
""
"I was a professor of ethics"
"and moral philosophy."
""
"Motherforker!"
""
"I'm getting a stomachache."
""
"I'm in a perfect utopia,"
""
"and I'm... I have a stomachache."
""
"This is awful."
""
"I-I, uh... I think I have"
"to tell Michael about this."
""
"Tell Michael about what?"
""
"Michael? Hi."
""
"What have you been up to?"
""
"Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet"
""
"Tahani and Jianyu."
""
"They are soul mates"
""
"and your next-door neighbors."
""
"Hello."
""
"Can I just say I love your house?"
""
"It's just so tiny and cute."
""
"It's like a little child's plaything,"
""
"like for a family of mice"
""
"or for a very fancy little dog."
""
"I love it."
"It's just so sweet and teensy."
""
"Just like you. Boop."
""
"- Oh."
"- Oh."
""
"You booped me. Ha-ha."
""
"- I did."
"- That's fun."
""
"Tahani and Jianyu are having a little"
""
"welcome party tonight,"
"and they've invited"
""
"the entire neighborhood."
""
"I simply adore entertaining."
""
"Don't I just adore it, Jianyu?"
""
"Oh, um, yes, by the way,"
""
"Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see?"
""
"And he obeys a strict code of silence."
""
"So when you see him smiling and nodding,"
""
"that's actually his way of"
"jumping up and down with glee."
""
"Isn't that right, darling?"
""
"So we'll see you tonight?"
""
"- Great."
"- Yes."
""
"No way."
""
"My entire house could fit in this room."
""
"Okay, uh..."
""
"help me out here."
""
"Tell me one good thing"
""
"that you did on Earth,"
""
"just one truly kind and decent act"
""
"so that I can feel better"
"about helping you out."
""
"Let's forget about good."
""
"Um, just tell me something"
"neutral about yourself."
""
"Like, tell me about"
"the day before you died."
""
"What do you remember?"
""
"Hi there."
""
"Do you have a second"
"to talk about the environment?"
""
"Do you have a second to eat my farts?"
""
"You missed."
""
"Pick it up"
""
"if you're so horny for the environment."
""
"I don't remember anything specific."
""
"- Oh."
"- Look."
""
"I might not have been a saint,"
""
"but it's not like I killed anybody."
""
"I wasn't an arsonist."
""
"I never found a wallet"
"outside of an IHOP and"
""
"thought about returning it but"
"saw the owner lived out of state"
""
"so just took the cash"
"and dropped the wallet"
""
"back on the ground."
""
"Okay, that's really specific,"
""
"and that makes me think that"
"you definitely did do that."
""
"All I'm saying is"
""
"these people might be ""good,"""
""
"but are they really"
"that much better than me?"
""
"Well, I spent half my life"
"in North Korea"
""
"fighting for women's rights"
""
"and the other half in Saudi Arabia"
""
"fighting for gay rights."
""
"So we said, ""If the U.N."
"won't remove those land mines,"
""
"we will."""
""
"And we dug up over a thousand"
"unexploded land mines"
""
"from the area surrounding the orphanage."
""
"Well, then he said,"
""
"""You can't give me both"
"your kidneys; you'll die."""
""
"And I said, ""But you will live."""
""
"And I know we just met on this bus"
"ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice."
""
"Oh, forget it. Heading to the bar!"
""
"Thank you, thank you."
""
"You all know that I am the"
"architect of this neighborhood."
""
"But what you don't know is..."
""
"Golly, I'm not supposed"
"to tell you this, but, um,"
""
"oh, what the heck?"
""
"This is actually"
"the very first neighborhood"
""
"that I have ever designed."
""
"I had been an apprentice"
"for over 200 years,"
""
"and my boss has finally given me"
""
"my first solo project."
""
"Yes!"
""
"Ah, gah-gah... gah-gah-gah."
"Hold on there, ace."
""
"Let me get more of them shrampies."
""
"- Okay, easy."
"- What?"
""
"They're for everybody, right?"
""
"Yes, exactly."
""
"And you deserve a perfect world"
""
"because every single one of you"
""
"is a good person."
""
"That's it for me. Back to you, Tahani."
""
"- Bravo, Michael, bravo!"
"- Thank you."
""
"Um, and I would just like to quickly say"
""
"if any of you would like"
"to play tennis tonight,"
""
"we have 36 regulation"
"grass tennis courts."
""
"Such fun. Cheers."
""
"Tahani, what a condescending bench."
""
"- Okay, okay, okay, okay."
"- Am I right?"
""
"Why does she still have"
"that British accent, right?"
""
"No one else here has an accent."
""
"She's choosing to have that accent."
""
"- Shh-shh-shh-shh."
"- ""Oh, hello."
""
"""I am just a big, beautiful,"
""
"utterly perfect cartoon giraffe."""
""
"Oh, okay. Okay."
""
"I think it's time to go home."
""
"Wait, wait, wait."
"I just have to go upstairs"
""
"real quick and steal"
"a bunch of gold stuff."
""
"Okay, don't do that."
""
"Don't do... no, Eleanor,"
"Eleanor, Eleanor."
""
"Hello, creepy house that I hate."
""
"Hello, one million clowns."
""
"Why aren't there stairs here?"
""
"What kind of weirdo house is this?"
""
"Ooh."
""
"Did you fill your bra with shrimp?"
""
"No."
""
"Yes."
""
"Whatever, it's freakin' heaven."
""
"I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish."
""
"That Tahani is a real butthead, huh?"
""
"Hey."
""
"At least I can still say ""butthead."""
""
"She is a butthead."
""
"Found some pajamas."
""
"Chidi... Chidi, Chidi?"
""
"I'm sorry that you had"
"to deal with this..."
""
"It's okay."
""
"It's not, though."
""
"Do you think anybody cared that I died?"
""
"Maybe someone did."
""
"I don't know."
""
"I was an only child."
""
"My parents were divorced"
"when I was a kid."
""
"They were both crummy people,"
""
"so they're probably..."
""
"in the Bad Place."
""
"Maybe they're being used"
"to torture each other."
""
"It would work."
""
"I bet way more people"
"cared that you died."
""
"'Cause you're a nice person."
""
"You're a nice person, Chidi..."
""
"Anaconda."
""
"Anagonye."
""
"Aganocomonga."
""
"Anagonye."
""
"- Ags... say it again."
"- Anagonye."
""
"No, say what you said before."
""
"I did. It's Anagonye."
""
"You just changed it."
""
"I didn't change it; it's my name."
""
"Argrugande. Ariana Grande."
""
"That's a person."
""
"I did it."
""
"Good night."
""
"Good night."
""
"Well, that's terrifying."
""
"That can't be good."
""
"Oh, fork."
""
"- Michael."
"- Mm?"
""
"Is that giant, terrifying ladybug"
""
"supposed to be there?"
""
"Ah, well, great question, Tahani."
""
"No. No, it's not."
""
"I have no idea why"
"any of this is happening"
""
"or how to control it."
""
"Should we run away then?"
""
"Yes."
""
"Righto."
""
"Chidi, Chidi!"
""
"What's going on?"
""
"Why are there giant animals everywhere?"
""
"Do you hear Ariana Grande playing?"
""
"Why is everyone wearing blue and yellow?"
""
"You're not."
""
"You're... you're the only one who's not."
""
"Eleanor, this is all happening"
"because of you."
""
"Ah, fork me."
""
"Okay, okay."
""
"We don't know this is because of me."
""
"Eleanor, this place is"
"a perfectly made Swiss watch,"
""
"and you are a wrench in the gears."
""
"Actually, you're a hammer,"
""
"just smashing the gears into dust."
""
"Oh, hang on."
""
"Not everybody here is perfect, okay?"
""
"Tahani is totally condescending."
""
"And there are a couple of,"
""
"you know, chunksters."
""
"Oh, come on!"
""
"No judgment. I'm just saying"
""
"I'm not the only one with flaws."
""
"So how can we be sure this is my fault?"
""
"You hogged all the shrimp,"
""
"and now there are shrimp flying around."
""
"You called Tahani a giraffe,"
""
"and now there are giraffes everywhere."
""
"Okay, fine, turns out"
"there are many ways"
""
"to know that it was me."
""
"Let's just face it, Eleanor,"
""
"you don't belong here."
""
"Well, then this system sucks."
""
"What, one in a million"
"gets to live in paradise"
""
"and everyone else"
"is tortured for eternity?"
""
"Come on."
""
"I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi,"
""
"but I was okay."
""
"I was a medium person."
""
"I should get to spend eternity"
"in a medium place!"
""
"Like Cincinnati."
""
"Everyone who wasn't perfect"
"but wasn't terrible"
""
"should get to spend eternity"
"in Cincinnati."
""
"Look, apparently"
"it doesn't work that way."
""
"I'm sorry, Eleanor,"
""
"but there's nothing anyone can do."
""
"Unless..."
""
"there is something we can do."
""

"How to be good."

"That was your job, right?"

"A professor of ethics?"

"No one knew I was a problem"
"when I arrived."

"Things only started getting crazy"

"after I was an ash-hole"
"to everyone at the party."

"You know I'm trying to say ""ash-hole"""

"and not ""ash-hole,"" right?"

"I got that, yes."

"Okay, give me a chance."

"Let me earn my place here."

"Let me be your ethical guinea pig."

"Hey, guys!"

"Uh, emergency neighborhood meeting, now!"

"We'll be right there, Michael!"

"If I walk out of here in these clothes,"

"Oh, stomachache."

"and talk it out after?"

"- W..."
"- Great."

"Hey, how do I make"
"that helper woman show up?"

"Hello? Front desk lady?"

"Magical slave robot?"
""
"Excuse me, Janet?"

"Hi there."
""
"Gah... still not used to it."
""
"Um, Janet, I need..."
""
"quick question:"
""
"can anyone access our search history,"
""
"or is this an incognito"
"browsing situation"
""
"like when you're stalking a hot male man"
""
"from your work computer?"
""
"It is 100% confidential."
""
"No one can access what you ask me,"
""
"including Michael."
""
"Now, what kind of pornography"
"would you like to see?"
""
"No. No, no, no, not porn."
""
"I, um... I need clothes"
""
"like yours and Chidi's with the stripes."
""

""
"Everybody, everybody!"
""
"Uh, gather round, please,"
"thank you, thank you."

"Obviously, there's something very wrong"

"What do we know, Janet?"

"Here."

"Yes, thank you, Janet."

"See, that's the trouble"

"One little flaw can lead to..."

"well, it can lead to"

"Gary over there."

"Hey, Gary."
""
"Hang in there, buddy."
""
"Boy, my armpits are leaking."
""
"What is that called again?"
""
"- Sweat."
"- Right, right."
""
"Still not used to being in a human body."
""
"And what do you do with sweat?"
""
"Do... do you lick it away,"
"is that right?"
""
"No, you dab it with a cloth."
""
"Oh, right."
""
"And then you lick the cloth?"
""
"That seems weirder."
""
"Michael."
""
"Look!"
""
"Okay. That's a good sign."
""
"It... it could mean that"
"this is almost over."
""
"Oh, such a relief."
""
"That was my first time"
"as a fashion ""don't,"""
""
"and I did not care for it."
""
"Okay, I think it is time"
""
"to make me good, partner."
"How do we do it?"

"Is there a pill I can take"

"or something I could vape?"
""
"Where did you get a chalkboard?"

"It's the Good Place;"

"you can get anything"
"you want at any time."

"And you chose a chalkboard?"

"What are you reading?"

"""The Metaphysics of Morals"""
"by Immanuel Kant."

"It's a treatise on"

"Oh, great!"

"So you've decided to help me?"

"I don't know."

"someone who deserves to be here?"

"Ooh, on that question,"

"I honestly think"

"I was just put here by mistake."

"Because Michael called me"

"Trick question."

"Do you not remember"

"You know, it's quite a fun way"

"to band together as a community,"

"isn't that right, Jianyu?"

"Oh, uh, yeah, sorry."

"For those of you who don't know,"

"Oh, well, hurrah."

"We need about, uh, 12 volunteers."

"Oh!"
""
"I can't believe all these"
"people are passing on flying"

"to pick up garbage all day."
""
"Have fun, nerds."

"I'll be soaring through the air"
"like a forkin' bird."

"Eleanor and I would love to help."

"Ah, hurrah-hurrah, yay."

"Dude."

"You want to prove you're not selfish?"

"Which do you choose?"

"Have fun."

"Whoo!"

"Hey!"

"Yeah!"
""
"Whee!"
""
"Hey, up there,"
""
"having fun, or does it"
"maybe suck, probably?"

"I'd say it's like"
"50 million simultaneous orgasms,"

"but better."

"How's volunteer garbage pickup?"

"- About the same."
"- Great!"

"Whee!"

"You know, this really reminds"
"me of my time in Vietnam,"

"picking up mortar shells"

"And I've been to Johnny Depp's"
"private bird sanctuary."

"Well, thank you."
"That's very kind of you to say."
""
"But it's also dead wrong."
""
"This neighborhood is a disaster."
""
"See, I must have made"
"a mistake somewhere."
""
"And it led to all this chaos,"
""
"and now I'm just... I'm just terrified"

"that it's gonna happen again."

"I'm trying to put a good face on"
""
"well, this... this face that"
"I've constructed for myself."

"But the truth is,"

"I... I'm just miserable."

"I have to go."
""
"Thank you so much for your service."

"Oh, no."
""
"Powerful people do not"
"handle failure well."

"Michael could be heading"
"for a total meltdown."
""
"Soul mate,"

"are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
""
"Should we say it at the same time?"
""
"All right. One, two, three."
""
"We must help Michael."
""
"Oh, you sly devil."

"You're going to keep me"

"All right, come on. Let's go."

"- Oh."
"- Ooh."
""
"Hey, Gunnar! Hey, Antonio!"
""
"Hey, Eleanor."
""
"- Isn't this great?"
"- Um, yeah."
""
"When I thought of the afterlife,"

"I totally pictured"

"being an unpaid, non-flying janitor."

"Us too!"

"You guys are so fun."

"Just relentlessly fun."
""
"I keep thinking, ""When are they"
"gonna stop being fun?"""

"And the answer is never."
""
"You're never gonna stop."
""
"Well, I have had a pretty full day"
""
"of being unselfish."
""
"I've made some new friends."
""
"My area's almost garbage-free."
""
"So you're gonna help me figure out"
""
"how to stay, right?"
""
"Well, that is a really tough question."
""
"Most great philosophers would say"
""
"helping you is pointless,"
""
"that you can't try to be good,"
""
"especially when your motivations"
"are so obviously corrupt."
""
"Yeah, but what do"
"most great philosophers know?"
""
"On the other hand, Aristotle"
""
"thought that moral virtue is something"
""
"that you could get better at."
""
"He... he compared it"
"to playing the flute."
""
"The more you practice,"
"the more you improve."
""
"Aristotle! That's my boy, right there."
""
"He was the best."
""
"I mean, most people agree"
"he was the best one."
""
"So it sounds to me like you are on board"
""
"the ""help Eleanor"" train."
""
"Well, I've narrowed it down"
"to two possibilities:"
""
"yes and no."
""
"Well, no worries."
""
"Just hit me up when you're done"
""
"weighing my life in your hands."
""
"I'll just keep doing what I do best:"
""
"being super considerate"
""
"and selfless."
""
"Hey, guys."
""
"Okay, Eleanor, reminder."
""
"We switched to a rotating system"
""
"for choosing a designated driver,"
""
"and it's your turn."
""
"Got it."
""
"Full disclosure,"
""
"I forgot we were doing this new system."
""
"I got off work early."
""
"I've been here for about an hour,"
""
"and I'm already pretty drunk."
""
"Someone else will do it."
""
"Good call."
""
"Guess the only place I'll be driving"
""
"is through the giant loophole"
""
"in the system I accidentally discovered."
""
"Beep! Beep!"
""
"Whoo!"
""
"Whoa!"
""
"I can't believe they've managed to mix"
""
"one million flavors together,"
""
"and yet, somehow, I can taste"
"each individual one."
""
"It's remarkable."
""
"I got no-flavor."
""
"- It's all I deserve, really."
"- No."
""
"Look, I... I appreciate"
"you trying to cheer me up."
""
"I really do, but you don't understand."
""
"This was the very first neighborhood"
""
"that I got to design."
""
"It was my chance to prove myself,"
""
"and now I've blown it."
""
"You know, sometimes"
"a flaw can make something"
""
"even more beautiful,"
""
"like with Cindy Crawford"
"and how short she is."
""
"Oh, Tahani,"
""
"if I made one tiny mistake in my design,"
""
"if there's a single glitch"
"in the system,"
""
"if even one blade of grass"
""
"is angled a... a fraction"
"of a degree off..."
""
"The whole neighborhood is compromised."
""
"Whose dog is that?"
""
"Guys, whose dog is that?"
""
"Whose dog is that?"
""
"See, this is one of those"
"glitches I was talking about."
""
"Nice try, puppy!"
""
"Whew!"
""
"That was a close one."
""
"Teacup?"
""
"Hey, have you seen my dog?"
""
"Shouldn't these be magical trash bags?"
""
"Five more minutes, flyers!"
""
"Five more minutes!"
""
"Oh, man, really?"
""
"Janet, I'm finished with cleanup,"
""
"and I'm ready to fly."
""
"- How do I start?"
"- Hop on the launch pad"
""
"and conjure an image"
"that brings you pure joy."
""
"Some people think of their wedding day"
""
"or favorite vacation spot."
""
"People puking on roller coasters."
""
"People puking on roller coasters."
""
"It's working!"
""
"Ow! What the fork?"
""
"Janet, any chance this is"
"a scheduled trash storm?"
""
"So here's the situation, Pevita."
""
"I kind of kicked your dog into the sun."
""
"But I got her back."
""
"Everything..."
""
"everything seems fine."
""
"Teacup, thank goodness you're okay."
""
"Everyone, it is merely"
"a construct of a dog."
""
"It feels no pain or joy or love."
""
"Teacup doesn't love me?"
""
"Oh!"
""
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no,"
"it definitely feels love."
""
"Do you actually want a dog that"
"loves you a little bit more?"
""
"Because I can kick her"
"right back into the sun"
""
"and get you another one just like that."
""
"- No!"
"- Oh, boy."
""
"I'm making things worse."
""
"Okay, all right, that's all right."
""
"Breathe. Breathe... do you breathe?"
""
"- Mm-hmm."
"- If you do, then just breathe"
""
"'cause everything's fine,"
"Michael, it's fine."
""
"Ooh!"
""
"It's raining garbage."
""
"Run!"
""
"Ooh, ooh, no, no, no,"
"I'm gonna run this way."
""
"Chidi! Hey."
""
"Before you say anything..."
""
"That's it, I just don't"
"want you to say anything."
""
"- What did you do?"
"- Nothing!"
""
"It just started raining trash"
""
"out of nowhere for no reason at all."
""
"Oh... okay, fine, fine."
""
"My bag broke, and I ditched the trash"
""
"instead of taking it"
"all the way to the dumpster."
""
"But in my defense,"
""
"there were only"
"five minutes left in flying"
""
"and I wanted to go flying."
""
"How is that a defense?"
""
"You made a bad choice."
""
"I made a bad choice?"
""
"We could have literally been flying,"
""
"and all you wanted to do"
"was talk about morals."
""
"I mean, you're like"
"the worst part of Superman."
""
"This is a relief."
""
"I can stop my deliberations."
""
"You're a selfish person,"
""
"and it is pointless to help you."
""
"You are on your own."
""
"Oh, man."
""
"How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar?"
""
"More cleaning up to do."
""
"It's a... it's a dream come true."
""
"We're okay!"
""
"You can't die here."
""
"Come on, I mean, even you have to admit,"
""
"those guys are psycho."
""
"I don't know what's happening to me."
""
"I mean, it's my duty"
""
"to be calm and in control"
""
"and I'm falling apart."
""
"No, Michael, you are"
"a paragon of fortitude."
""
"You're a mountain of strength."
""
"I'm not a mountain of strength."
""
"I'm a canyon"
""
"full of poo-poo."
""
"Jianyu, the architect"
"of this neighborhood"
""
"has just referred to himself as a canyon"
""
"full of poo-poo."
""
"Surely now, you will say something?"
""
"Grace us with your vocalized wisdom."
""
"Please, I'm begging you."
""
"Oh."
""
"Yes, yes, I understand."
""
"The strength is inside me."
""
"It's been there all along."
""
"No, of course,"
"I can overcome any obstacle."
""
"Oh, thank you, Jianyu, thank you."
""
"I'm back."
""
"You did it."
""
"Oh, you have so much to teach me."
""
"Maybe I should try to be silent too."
""
"No really, look."
""
"Here I go."
""
"Oh! That was wonderful!"
""
"So cleansing."

"Just water tonight, huh?"
""
"Designated driver?"

"Yeah, it sucks."

"I think it's awesome."

"I mean, someone's got to do it, right?"

"I think it's a cool thing"
"to do for people."
""
"Yeah. No... no, I meant..."
""
"I meant... I... it sucks"
"that I can't do it"
""
"more often, you know?"

"I actually prefer it to drinking."
""
"Staying sober and"

"that's my buzz."
""
"Hey, guys, good news and bad news."

"See that hot bartender over there?"

"He's into me,"

"The bad news is, it means"
"I can't drive you guys home."

"But I did call a cab for you guys."
""
"But they recognized my number,"

"and they didn't want to come."

"I've thrown up in a lot of cabs."

"So are we good here?"

"Eleanor, you have"
"a very important choice to make."
""
"If you blow us off,"

"you are banned from"
"Thursday night drinks"

"Yeah, I'm good with that."

"I'll see you guys at work."

"Peace!"

"You, let's go."

"Hey."

"How did you know I was here?"

"I saw you from my window."

"That's where I live, by the way."

"Not that you ever asked."

"What are you doing?"

"I went to all the places"

"where I dumped trash earlier"
""
"and cleaned it up"
""
"so it couldn't be traced back to me."
""
"Well, it looks like you"
""
"cleaned up everything."
""
"You're doing this because you feel bad."
""
"And you're not even doing it"
"to get me to help you anymore"

"because I told you"
"that's not gonna happen."
""
"Okay, yeah, fine, I felt bad"
""
"for stupid Gunnar and stupider Antonio"
""
"and the whole neighborhood."
""
"I felt bad about what I did."
""
"It was a weird feeling."
""
"Not used to it. Didn't love it."
""
"Well, feeling remorse about being wrong"
""
"isn't as good as just"
"doing something right,"

"but it's a start."

"Look, I think you're capable of change."
""
"And I will help you try."

"Oh, wow, man,"

"I swear I won't let you down."

"Hi there. I've collected"

"the worst-smelling garbage"
"that I could find."

"Do you still want me to dump it"
"inside of Antonio's house?"
""
"What?"
""
"No."

"I did not tell you to do that."

""
"but she's a little stiff,"
"so I've been trying to get her"
""
"to be a little more casual"
"and conversational."
""
"- I'll have what she's having."
""
"- It's a work in progress."
""
"Listen, Chidi."
""
"I've been studying your file."
""
"You're a very"
"interesting case."
""
"You essentially only did one"
"thing while you were on earth."
""
"You thought"
"and wrote about ethics."
""
"- Yes, I spent 18 years"
"working on my manuscript"
""
"called ""Who We Are"
"and Who We Are Not--colon--"
""
"""Practical Ethics"
"and Their Application"
""
"in the Modern World--"
"semi-colon--a Treatise--"""
""
"- Yes, yes, yes,"
"that's the one."
""
"That's the one."
""
"I think you should"
"experience new adventures."
""
"You know, do things that you"
"haven't done on earth, right?"
""
"So why don't we meet tomorrow"
""
"and try out some new hobbies."
""
"- Uh, why not?"
""
"I'll--I'll see you guys"
"tomorrow."
""
"- Not if I see you first."
"Where's the beef?"
""
"- [chuckles]"
""
"I don't know."
"- Hump day."
""
"[knocking]"
""
"- Hello, Eleanor."
""
"Jianyu, darling, look, it's"
"Eleanor from next door."
""
"- Is he asleep?"
""
"- Yeah, there's really"
"no way to tell."
""
"Come on in."
""
"What brings you"
"to our home, my dear?"
""
"- Well, I'm simply"
"repaying your kind gift"
""
"with a housewarming"
"gift of my own."
""
"Fresh pears."
""
"It's a plant,"
"just like your gift,"
""
"but you can"
"actually eat them."
""
"So maybe it's"
"a better gift."
""
"Who's to say?"
"- That's so kind."
""
"However, in, um,"
"Chinese culture,"
""
"pears are actually"
"a symbol of bad luck."
""
"And--and I wouldn't want"
"to offend Jianyu,"
""
"so I'm afraid"
"I'm gonna have to"
""
"throw these in the garbage."
""
"But do come and sit down."
""
"We haven't even had a chance"
""
"to discuss all of the mayhem"
"in our neighborhood yet."
""
"It's so disconcerting."
"- Yes."
""
"What do you think"
"is causing it?"
""
"- Oh, I'm sure"
"I don't know."
""
"But we must keep our heads up."
""
"In fact, tomorrow I'm actually"
"going door-to-door"
""
"to make sure that"
"every single person"
""
"in this entire neighborhood"
"is keeping calm"

"and carrying on."

"'Cause I think that helping"
"others will make me feel like"
""
"I truly belong here,"
"you know?"
""
"- Here's a brainstorm,"
"why don't I go with you?"
""
"I mean, I would love to do my"
"part to help the neighborhood,"
""
"not to mention, get a little"
"bonding time with you, lady."
""
"- Oh, hurrah!"
""
"Such fun."
""
"- I'm telling you,"
"Tahani's out to get me."
""
"- What are you talking about?"
""
"- This note was slipped"
"under my door yesterday."
""
"It has to be Tahani."
""
"She just said to me, ""I want to"
"feel like I truly belong here."""
""
"Well, where have I seen"
"the word ""belong"" recently?"
""
"Oh yeah, kaplow!"
""
"- I really don't think"
"she's the type of person"
""
"who would write this."
""
"- She is that kind of person"
"and she did write it."
""
"She wants everybody to think"
"she's such a perfect princess"
""
"just 'cause she's tall"
"and glamorous and has"
""
"cappuccino skin"
"and curves everywhere--"
""
"and now I'm"
"complimenting her."
""
"And kind of turned on."
""
"The point is,"
"she straight up sucks, bro."
""
"[chiming]"
""
"- Whoa."
"- Typical Tahani."
""
"Brings us a faulty plant"
"so she can brag about"
""
"being a better gardener."
""
"- No, I think this"
"is another way in which"
""
"your negative actions"
"affect this world."
""
"This plant represents"
"your relationship to Tahani,"
""
"so when you're mean to her,"
"it starts to wilt."
""
"- Well, then this plant"
"is doomed,"
""
"because tomorrow, I'm going with"
"her and I'm gonna prove to you"
""
"and to everyone that she is"
"secretly a two-faced,"
""
"calculating, phony bench."
""
"[weeping]"
""
"Hmm."
"Yeah."
""
"Truth hurts,"
"doesn't it, plant?"
""
"."
""
"- So all I want to do"
"is just check in,"
""
"see how everyone's"
"holding up."
""
"Just bring some cheer to"
"these extraordinary people."
""
"- Cool."
""
"So tell me about yourself."
""
"I mean, I want to"
"hear it all, girlfriend."
""
"The good, the bad,"
"the really bad,"
""
"the embarrassing, the"
"humiliating, just--let's bond!"
""
"- Okay, well I was"
"born in Pakistan,"
""
"raised in London, schooled"
"in Paris, but I think"
""
"the primary reason that I'm in"
"the Good Place is that"
""
"I raised quite a lot of money"
"for non-profit groups."
""
"- Oh."
""
"Did you ever, uh, skim a little"
"off the top for yourself?"
""
"- Gracious, no, no!"
""
"Every penny"
"was accounted for."
""
"And as I raised nearly"
"$60 billion,"
""
"there was quite"
"a lot of pennies."
""
"- [chuckles]"
""
"- But I also dabbled"
"in some other professions."
""
"I was a model,"
"a museum curator,"
""
"an ""It Girl,"" and..."
""
"oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's"
"muse for a while."
""
"That was quite fun."
""
"- Modeling?"
"That's a crazy life."
""
"Want to tell me about that"
"rock bottom you probably hit?"
""
"- Oh, I didn't really"
"do it for long."
""
"Couture just doesn't"
"fit my body."
""
"I'm cursed with"
"ample bosom."
""
"- And yet you soldier on."
""
"- Oh, this is silly--"
""
"so ""Tahani"" means"
"""congratulations"" in Arabic."
""
"And ""Al-Jamil"""
"means ""beautiful,"""
""
"so my full name"
"altogether means--"
""
"- ""Congratulations, Beautiful."""
""
"- Thanks, Eleanor."
"You big flirt."
""
"[giggles]"
""
"- Hey, babe, got you coffee."
""
"- Oh, great."
""
"Oh, Andy's Coffee, uh,"
"we shouldn't go there."
""
"Everybody's boycotting."
""
"- Yeah, I know that one guy"
"found a scorpion in his latte."
""
"I don't really care, though,"
"'cause it's so close to here."
""
"- No, no, no, it's because"
"he's sexually harassing people."
""
"Look, a journalist went"
"undercover for an interview"
""
"and recorded him."
""
"Here, watch."
""
"- Here's the thing, sweetheart."
""
"You're very qualified,"
"but you're also what we call"
""
"in the coffee shop game"
"a, uh, ""dog-face."""
""
"You're a three, and you have to"
"be a nine to work here."
""
"It's just math."
""
"- So I didn't get the job?"
""
"- [chuckles]"
""
"No, dog-face,"
"you didn't get the job."
""
"All right, I'll check"
"your references."
""
"Just to be nice--"
"- Hey, my breasts!"
""
"- I'll check 'em."
"Oh, they're good. Honk!"
""
"- I mean, this guy's a monster,"
"we can't support this guy."
""
"- Okay, hey,"
"you're not better than me"
""
"just 'cause you won't support"
"a guy who grabbed a boob once."
""
"- No, I'm just saying we"
"shouldn't go there."
""
"We can get coffee"
"somewhere else."
""
"- Did you know your left"
"reference is a little bit"
""
"bigger than your"
"right reference?"
""
"It's not a bad thing,"
"it's just--it's a thing."
""
"- This is the perfect hobby"
"for you, Chidi."
""
"Cartography."
""
"Your neighborhood"
"stretches way beyond"
""
"what you've already seen."
""
"And you can map it,"
""
"revealing all of"
"the mysteries,"
""
"like an explorer."
""
"- I see how"
"that might be fun."
""
"Uh, but, uh,"
"exploring makes me nervous."
""
"I have what doctor's call"
"""directional insanity."""
""
"I once got lost"
"on an escalator."
""
"So not exactly"
"Christopher Columbus."
""
"- Fun fact: Columbus is in"
"the Bad Place"
""
"because of all the raping,"
"slave trade, and genocide."
""
"- The fact that"
"it makes you nervous"
""
"is exactly why"
"you should do it."
""
"You know, get out of"
"your comfort zone."
""
"Become a trail-blazer."
""
"- Fun fact: all deceased members"
"of the Portland Trail Blazers"
""
"basketball team are also"
"in the Bad Place."
""
"[giggles]"
""
"- Yeah, sorry about this."
""
"I steered her away from"
"colloquialisms"
""
"and into ""fun facts"""
"and trivia tidbits."
""
"I thought it'd be"
"more in her wheelhouse."
""
"- Fun fact: a ""wheelhouse"""
"is a part of a boat."
""
"- Okay, thank you,"
"Janet, thank you."
""
"- Fun fact: Janet is me."
""
"- All right,"
"let's forget about exploring."
""
"Plenty more ideas for hobbies."
""
"Let's walk back"
"to town, shall we?"
""
"Wrong way."
"- Yep."
""
"- Well, Glenn, we just wanted to"
"make sure you were all right."
""
"- Tahani, you're too sweet."
""
"Isn't she just"
"the nicest person?"
""
"- Mm-hmm."
""
"That is what a lot"
"of people are saying."
""
"- Oh, everyone I know"
"is saying that."
""
"- Yeah, it's just a big"
"neighborhood"
""
"full of enormous mansions"
"and people who love Tahani!"
""
"[both laughing]"
""
"- Eleanor and I just want to see"
"if there's anything"
""
"we can do to help you."
""
"- Oh, Tahani,"
"you are so thoughtful."
""
"Despite all the chaos earlier,"
""
"we simply couldn't"
"be happier."
""
"- Oh, I'm so glad"
"to hear it, Cualli."
""
"Please take"
"a maple butter scone."
""
"I made them fresh"
"this morning."
""
"- Oh, they look"
"a bit burned."
""
"But they're not."
""
"Hmm."
"Oh, fork, that's good."
""
"- Extra, extra!"
""
"Read all about you."
""
"Chidi, this is the"
"perfect hobby for you."
""
"Journalism."
""
"- Well, obviously,"
"I like to write."
""
"But I don't love deadlines."
""
"I prefer to take my time"
"with things."
""
"- Yes, I know."
""
"Uh, you never even named"
"your dog, did you?"
""
"When it ran away,"
"you posted signs saying,"
""
"""responds to long pauses."""
""
"Look, Chidi, I'm just trying to"
"find you a hobby--"
""
"the hat--that will bring you"
"a positive experience."
""
"What do you say?"
""
"- I'm loving that hat on you."
""
"It would look even better"
"on my floor."
""
"- What is happening now?"
""
"- I suggested she be friendlier;"
"she seems to have"
""
"slipped right into"
"overt sexuality."
""
"- I got something"
"you can slip into."
""
"- Oh--"
"- Janet, no!"
""
"No, Janet."
""
"- Oh, Jianyu, darling,"
"would you like some tea?"
""
"- That nod meant no, apparently."
""
"- Well, it was nice to get out"
"and meet all of"
""
"our wonderful neighbors."
""
"They all truly belong here."
""
"- Oh, yes they do,"
"cutie-pants."
""
"Boop!"
""
"Well, I should really be going."
"I have to begin"
""
"my 12 step Korean"
"skincare regiment,"
""
"but, uh, I'll see--"
"oh, no, no, no."
""
"Please stay"
"and enjoy the evening tea."
""
"I'll see you soon."
""
"Boop!"
""
"- ""The Diary of"
"Tahani Al-Jamil."""
""
"- Okay."
"Arc welding."
""
"You could learn sculpture,"
"you can make furniture,"
""
"you can get your hands"
"a little greasy, you know,"
""
"and you make things."
""
"- This equipment"
"is very scary!"
""
"- Don't be a baby."
"It can't hurt you."
""
"Watch, I'll blowtorch"
"your face off."
""
"- Janet."
"- Whatever."
""
"This whole thing is stupid."
""
"- Oh, brother."
""
"I told her to be less flirty"
"and now she's"
""
"cruel and distant, apparently."
""
"I just can't get this right."
""
"- Thank you for trying to"
"find me a new hobby."
""
"Um, but I just want to"
"be an academic."
""
"I want to keep working on"
"my manuscript."
""
"- Chidi, here's the thing--"
""
"see, I read your whole book,"
"all 3,600 pages of it."
""
"It's, um..."
""
"how shall I put this?"
""
"- It's a mess, dude."
""
"- Hey!"
"- She's right."
""
"You see, Chidi, I can"
"read the entirety"
""
"of the world's literature"
"in about an hour."
""
"This took me two weeks"
"to get through."
""
"I mean, it's so convoluted,"
"I just kept reading"
""
"the same paragraph over and over"
"again, trying to figure out"
""
"what the heck"
"you were saying."
""
"- Oh, no."
""
"- I mean, on page 1,000,"
""
"you start section two"
"with the sentence,"
""
"""Of course, the exact opposite"
"might be true."""
""
"You're a brilliant guy, Chidi."
""
"But you just kept revising"
"and rewriting"
""
"and adding words to your title."
""
"I think you just twisted"
"yourself up into a knot."
""
"- I have a very bad"
"stomachache."
""
"- Hey, man."
""
"[door closes]"
""
"What's wrong?"
""
"- Am I a good teacher?"
""
"Am I clear?"
"Do I make sense?"
""
"- Yeah, you're"
"a great teacher."
""
"I'm super ethical now."
""
"- What's that?"
"- Hmm?"
""
"Nah--don't worry about it."
""
"I stole Tahani's diary."
""
"So I could see if her"
"handwriting matches the note"
""
"and also read about all"
"the mean and terrible things"
""
"she's definitely done so I can"
"prove she's actually evil."
""
"[fire crackling]"
""
"Huh."
""
"What do you think"
"that means?"
""
"."
""
"- You stole Tahani's diary."
""
"- I know I broke"
"some ethical rule,"
""
"but I had good reason."
""
"- Eleanor, in order to be"
"a good person,"
""
"you have to do good things."
""
"And not stealing people's stuff,"
"that is just"
""
"a basic kindergarten rule."
""
"I mean, do I also have to"
"tell you to not throw sand?"
""
"- First of all, throwing sand"
"is an excellent way"
""
"to put out a vodka fire."
""
"- Why would you even know that?"
""
"- Second of all, I know that"
"it may not be nice,"
""
"but neither is pretending to be"
"100% perfect, like Tahani does."
""
"She wrote that note."
"- No she didn't!"
""
"You did!"
""
"I was hoping you would come to"
"this conclusion on your own,"
""
"but, obviously, no one here"
"would ever threaten you."
""
"That note is the Good Place"
"manifesting your own guilt."
""
"Like with the plant,"
"or when you literally made"
""
"giant shrimp fly through"
"the air."
""
"- I wrote myself the note."
""
"And as it turns out,"
""
"I do belong here."
""
"Because I'm just as good"
"as everyone else."
""
"- No, no, no."
""
"No, you don't belong here."
""
"And in this place,"
"everyone is better than you."
""
"It has been proven by"
"an infallible formula."
""
"Tahani might be"
"a little British"
""
"and condescending at times,"
""
"but she devoted her entire life"
"to helping other people."
""
"She's a good person."
""
"Accept that."
""
"- Hey, babe."
""
"Great news, I got us tickets"
"to the Coyotes game."
""
"- Awesome!"
"- But, ooh, yikes."
""
"Turns out two of"
"the players have DUIs."
""
"Guess we can't"
"cheer for that team."
""
"- Eleanor, I--"
"- You know what?"
""
"Instead,"
"let's just stay in,"
""
"watch a Roman Polanski movie,"
"listen to R. Kelly,"
""
"and eat Chik-fil-A."
""
"Does that sound good?"
""
"There's bad stuff"
"everywhere, man."
""
"It's impossible to avoid."
""
"- Yeah, but shouldn't"
"we just try?"
""
"Shouldn't we just try to do the"
"right thing whenever we can?"
""
"- Why? It's so much harder"
"to live like that."
""
"And it's not like"
"someone's keeping score."
""
"- [sighs]"
""
"- Look, I know you're gonna"
"break up with me, okay?"
""
"I'm not an idiot."
""
"I read your emails"
"to your dad."
""
"Have fun being so amazing"
"and perfect until you die."
""
"And by the way,"
"I'm talking really fast"
""
"because I still"
"go to Andy's Coffee,"
""
"and I got a full"
"punch card, bro."
""
"Good people"
"make me insecure."
""
"When I'm around someone"
"who I think is better than me,"
""
"I try and drag them"
"down to my level."
""
"That's why perfect Tahani"
"is like my kryptonite."
""
"- Well, even admitting that"
"is an important step."
""
"And also,"
"maybe don't listen to me."
""
"- I would love"
"not to listen to you."
""
"Wait, what?"
""
"- Basically, my life's work"
""
"is 3,600 pages of garbage."
""
"Even Michael couldn't"
"understand it."
""
"- So?"
""
"What does Michael know?"
"- Everything."
""
"That's my point--"
"he knows everything,"
""
"and it was too convoluted,"
"even for him."
""
"- Michael does not"
"know everything."
""
"Michael does not know"
"I'm not supposed to be here."
""
"You wrote 4,000 pages"
"on one of the most"
""
"complicated subjects"
"in the world."
""
"I mean I used to get bored"
"halfway through"
""
"writing a text message."
""
"Be proud."
""
"- I want to broaden"
"my horizons"
""
"and try new things,"
"and I will."
""
"But even though I might have"
"gotten lost in the weeds,"
""
"I loved writing this book."
""
"And I want to try again."
""
"So..."
""
"will you be my advisor?"
""
"- Chidi, all I want"
"is for you to be happy."
""
"So if spending eternity"
"getting blunt feedback"
""
"on your circular, rambling ideas"
"will make you happy,"
""
"then of course"
"I will be your advisor."
""
"Let's throw that monstrosity"
"in the trash and start over."
""
"- Aren't there maybe"
"some parts worth salvaging?"
""
"- Honestly, man,"
"I don't even know."
""
"I mean, that thing"
"is unreadable."
""
"I literally learned what"
"headaches were"
""
"because that thing"
"gave me a headache."
""
"- Okay."
""
"- There you go."
""
"New beginnings!"
"Well done."
""
"- [crying]"
""
"[gentle knocking]"
""
"Oh!"
""
"Oh, hello, Eleanor."
"Hi."
""
"Sorry, I was just"
"cleaning up."
""
"- You okay?"
""
"Do you want to..."
""
"talk about it?"
""
"- Desperately."
""
"It's Jianyu."
""
"I just can't seem to"
"connect with him."
""
"I know that he took"
"a vow of silence,"
""
"but he won't even talk to me,"
"his soul mate!"
""
"And I adore talking."
""
"- I know."
"You do."
""
"- Eleanor, you don't know what"
"it's like to be in paradise"
""
"and feel like there's something"
"just not quite right."
""
"- Well..."
""
"I may not know exactly"
"what you're feeling,"
""
"but I do understand."
""
"And you deserve to be happy,"
"because..."
""
"you are an impressive,"
"thoughtful, and special person."
""
"Not to mention..."
""
"you have a rockin' bod."
""
"- [chuckles]"
""
"- I mean,"
"Jianyu may be mute,"
""
"but he's not blind."
""
"- [laughs]"
""
"- You two belong here."
""
"And you belong together."
""
"And you have all of eternity,"
"so there's plenty of time"
""
"for things to change."
""
"- Oh, thank you."
""
"I really needed to hear that."
"Come here."
""
"- Ugh, of course your hugs"
"are amazing."
""
"."
""
"- [yawns]"
""
"[yelps]"
""
"Stupid ledge."
""
"Ugh, stairs."
""
"Everyone here is"
"really into hugging."
""
"- Looks like"
"someone learned something."
""
"- Well, it's 'cause"
"someone else"
""
"is a really good teacher."
""
"- Eleanor, hello."
""
"How are you,"
"my dear, sweet bestie?"
""
"- Never better."
"What's up?"
""
"- Well, Janet has been acting"
"as my assistant."
""
"It's not what she was"
"designed to do."
""
"Didn't go great."
"- But now I'm back to normal."
""
"It turns out"
"that the best Janet"
""
"was the Janet that was"
"inside Janet all along."
""
"- She was feeling a little lost,"
"so I gave her"
""
"a self-help book"
"to restore her confidence."
""
"- Now I'm living my truth"
"and creating my bliss."
""
"- Anyway, um, look,"
""
"Michael asked me if I would"
"serve as his assistant,"
""
"but I'd quite like to focus"
"on my relationship with Jianyu."
""
"So I recommended you"
"for the job."
""
"[giggles]"
""
"- Eleanor, you"
"and I could work"
""
"side-by-side to figure out"
""
"what's going wrong"
"with this neighborhood."
""
"Will you help me?"
""
"- How could I say no?"
"- Yeah, hurrah!"
""
"- Hurrah!"
"- [giggles]"
""
"- What now?"
""
"[sighs]"
""
"Relax, Eleanor."
""
"You sent this to yourself."
""
"This is your own guilt"
"manifesting itself."
""
"- I've been waiting for you."
""
"- Jianyu?"
""
"You talk now?"
""
"You sent me"
"these threatening notes?"
""
"What the fork, man?"
""
"Some Buddhist monk you are."
""
"- You don't belong here."
""
"Admit it."
""
"- Okay, you're right."
""

"Ha! How do you like them ethics?"
"I just ethics'd you in the face, Chidi!"

"By the way, uh, what's you're favorite color"
"for the tablecloths?"
"Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes."
"It's called ""pleurigloss."""

"It's the color of..."
"When a soldier comes home from war"

"Hmm. How about blue?"
"Tahani, I'm so sorry."
"We need to cancel this party immediately."
"But why?"
"For a being like me,"
"retirement..."
"is not something fun."
"What is ""retirement"" for you exactly?"

"- What? - Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry."
"I was just trying to honor you."
"Please, allow me to reconceive the event."
"Of course."
"All right, everyone, we're starting over."
"The key word for tonight is just ""somber."""
"Jianyu, my love, we're gonna have to get rid"
"of all of the party poppers immediately."
"No, not by using them."
"No, Jianyu. Done."
"He's gonna be tortured?"
"Dang it. I was almost handed a perfect solution"
"to all my problems without having to work for it at all,"
"and now it's gone."
"Why do bad things always happen to mediocre people"
"who are lying about their identities?"
"Okay, you have two options."
"You can confess and save Michael,"
"or you can continue to lie"
"and condemn him to an eternity of unimaginable pain."
"Or option C..."
"continue to lie about myself"
"and find a way to save Michael."
"Can we somehow throw Tahani under the bus?"
"That would be a classic"
"""two birds with one stone"" scenario."
"Plus, I'd get her house."
"Three birds."
"No, there's no way to stop this except confessing."
"Any moment now, Michael is going to get on that train,"
"and we will never see him again,"
"just like Professor Lindeman"
"after I asked him to reread my 3,600-page manuscript."
"He said he was going out for cigarettes,"
"but then he just left his tenured position"
"at the Sorbonne."
"Great story. Janet?"
"Hi, there."
"Hi. So the only way"
"out of the neighborhood is a train?"
"That's correct. I am the only one"
"who can call the train, and it needs me to operate."
"Choo-choo."
"One more question, and, um, this is a little weird,"
"but can we..."
"uh, shut you down?"
"Yes, great question."
"There is a kill switch"
"in a remote sector of the neighborhood"
"in the event that I malfunction"
"and attempt to harm the residents."
"If you press it, I will be destroyed."
"- Anything else? - No, that's good, thanks."
"- Okay. - Whoa, you want to kill Janet?"
"Michael can't retire if he can't leave."
"He can't leave if there's no Janet"
"to run the train."
"It's a perfect solution."
"Janet, high five, please?"
"Thanks, babe."
"You cannot kill Janet."
"Killing is one of the most famous"
"moral no-nos."
"Janet is a nonhuman object who was sent here to help us,"
"and the way she can help us is if we kill her."
"We're doing one small murder-y thing"
"for a bigger, better reason."
"The ends justify the means."
"Do you know who said that?"
"Was it someone nice and great, like Oprah?"
"It was Machiavelli..."
"A very non-Oprah-like figure."
"And what happens after we kill her?"
"We'll have to lie to everyone about what we did,"
"and lying is always wrong."
"Why? Why would I tell Henry that I liked his boots?"
"I don't like his boots. I hate his boots."
"Yes, I know."
"You've talked about it for the last two days."
"I lied to him. You wrote your thesis on Kant."
"He believed that lying is always morally wrong..."
"no exceptions."
"Yes, well, Kant was a lonely, obsessive hermit"
"with zero friends."
"Sometimes we do thing just to be polite,"
"but if you really feel that strongly about it,"
"tell him the truth."
"Also, I don't care,"
"'cause it's the middle of the night."
"This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors."
"They do?"
"Hey, Chidi."
"- You sit in on my class today? - Uh, I did, yeah."
"Great lecture, by the way... so bleak."
"Thanks, bud."
"It's actually perfect that you are here."
"I got something for you."
"Oh, my God."
"You loved mine so much,"
"I decided to get you your own pair."
"We can be boot brothers."
"Wow. I can't accept these. They're too expensive."
"Sure you can. Try 'em on, mate."
"The fact that you liked mine so much"
"really made me feel like I made the right choice to buy them."
"After all, why should I have all the fun and boots, eh?"
"I-I don't... I don't know."
"Those look great."
"Take 'em for a spin."
"You're flying."
"Mm, thanks."
"Speeches! Time for speeches, everyone."
"Michael, as someone who didn't exactly have"
"the steadiest parental guidance,"
"I just want to thank you."
"You were always there for us."
"I shouldn't have been. I was the problem."
"Yes, but..."
"it was also great when you weren't there."
"Don't worry. Soon I won't be... forever."
"Because of The Eternal Shriek!"
"Yes, thank you, Glenn."
"Look, what I'm trying to say is this..."
"Michael, you always kept us warm and safe"
"like a bright, glowing sun."
"Like the one I kicked the dog into"
"or the one I'm going to be burned"
"on the surface of for eternity?"
"Okay, no more speeches."
"Speeches are over."
"Michael's going to talk now."
"Ugh, I'm sorry I was so grumpy."
"It's just I'm sad that I have to leave"
"before doing all the human things"
"that I wanted to do."
"I wanted to get my hair wet."
"You know, I-I wanted to pull a hamstring."
"To learn the difference between ""toward"" and ""towards."""
"I wanted to do that thing where you walk down the hallway,"
"and someone else is walking the other way,"
"and then you both lean to one side"
"and then the other,"
"and then you both chuckle over your shared foible."
"I wanted to get a rewards card,"
"any rewards card."
"I-I wanted to talk briefly to someone and then say,"
"""Take it sleazy."""
"I wanted to eat a saltine."
"Oh! I actually have some saltines."
"Here, try this."
"Pretty dry..."
"and too salty."
"Well, going out on a real low note here."
"Okay, bye, everyone."
"Well, take it sleazy."
"You got to say it?"
"Yes, but then you say it back."
"No, it's not organic."
"Uh, Janet, how many ""Janets"" have there been?"
"There have been 25 generations of Janet."
"Each new update of Janet gains more wisdom"
"and social abilities."
"Fun fact... the first Janet had a click wheel."
"So it's like aging for a human?"
"You're... you're growing up?"
"That's how I like to think of it, Chidi."
"I can't eat, so every time there's a new version of Janet,"
"I like to take a piece of birthday cake"
"and smash it around where my mouth is."
"Look, Janet has... has learned and grown."
"She's essentially living a life. We can't kill her."
"Not with that attitude, we can't."
"Listen, man, I'm dead, you're dead,"
"we all died, and now we're killing her."
"Pay it forward."
"Uh, no, that's not what that means at all."
"Eleanor?"
"Here we are."
"Just press that button, and it's good-bye, Janet."
"Chidi, I can see that you're worried,"
"and I just want to assure you,"
"I am not human, and I cannot feel pain."
"Ah, thank you. That helps."
"However, I should warn you..."
"I am programmed with a fail-safe measure."
"As you approach the kill switch,"
"I will begin to beg for my life."
"It's just there in case of an accidental shut down,"
"but it will seem very real."
"Cool. So who's doing this, me or you?"
"I think I have to."
"Um, being a bystander seems worse, somehow."
"Okay, here we go."
"Chidi, no, no, no! Chidi, please!"
"Please, please, please don't hurt me."
"I don't want to die! Please, please..."
"Ah!"
"Again, I am not human."
"I can't die."
"I am simply an anthropomorphized vessel of knowledge"
"built to make your life easier."
"You're pleading seems so real."
"Oh, yes, it is a very effective fail-safe."
"Ugh, you want a robot killed right,"
"you have to do it yourself."
"Eleanor? Eleanor, no, no, no."
"Please, wait, wait, wait, wait. Eleanor, I have kids."
"I have three beautiful children..."
"Tyler, Emma, and little, tiny baby Phillip."
"Look at Tyler. Tyler has asthma, but he is battling it like a champ."
"Look at him. No, Eleanor, look at them."
"Look at them!"
"Look at them!"
"Aah! It's so realistic!"
"Eleanor, again, I'm not human."
"This is a stock photo of the crowd"
"at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards."
"That's right, it's not real."
"- Let's just do this. - Right."
"Please, I have so much to live for."
"- No, no, no, please. - We're not even near the..."
"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
"That party was lame, so I bailed."
"Then I saw you, so I followed you here."
"- Oh, look, a button. - No, no, no!"
"Jianyu, no!"
"Ah, man, I wanted to push that button."
"Not cool, dude."
"Whoa. What happened to Janet?"
"She's... she's dead. I-I-I killed her."
"Not killed."
"Remember, Janet was not a living being,"
"so she can't be killed."
"Attention... I have been murdered."
"Attention... I have been murdered."
"Attention... I have been murdered."
"Attention... I have been murdered."
"Attention..."
"What do we do, Eleanor?"
"What do we do? Chidi, you just murdered Janet."
"We have to flee your crime scene."
"Run!"
"I have been murdered."
"- Sorry, Janet! - I have been murdered."
"Attention... I have..."
"Attention..."
"I have been murdered."
"Okay, dude, crash course in getting away with bad stuff."
"You have to act calm and cool"
"like you don't have a care in the world."
"Okay?"
"Great."
"Oh, wow. Look, it's ""Weekend at Bernie's,"""
"'cause you're a dead guy in sunglasses."
"We have fun, don't we, Chidi?"
"I've never been more stressed out in my entire life."
"I know what you need."
"Janet, can you get Chidi some weed?"
"Oh, that's right. You killed Janet."
"Well, Janet's been murdered."
"That's a nice capper to this wonderful day."
"I don't really know what happens now"
"because Janet has never been murdered before..."
"only today, here on my watch,"
"while I was distracted with a party"
"that Tahani was throwing for me,"
"which I didn't want."
"Michael, you mustn't blame yourself."
"I'm not. I'm blaming you."
"Anyway, what is there to say about Janet"
"that hasn't already been said"
"by the giant Janet alarm in the sky?"
"""I've been murdered""!"
"I think that says it all."
"Hello."
"Janet, you're alive!"
"Hello, Architect,"
"please enter your four-digit pin."
"Uh, what is it? Uh, what is it?"
"What is it? Um... oh, right, right, right!"
"It's my, uh... my birth year."
"Uh..."
"I got to change that. That's too easy to guess."
"Janet..."
"who murdered you?"
"- Oh. Oh, no. - Shh, okay."
"- Hello. - Yes, hello."
"Oh, yeah."
"Uh, her memory must have been wiped clean,"
"so now she's gonna have to re-upload"
"all the knowledge in the universe,"
"which will only take a few days. Okay..."
"- Hello. - Hello."
"Hello. Hello."
"Everyone, um, until I get to the bottom of this,"
"my retirement is officially postponed."
"Whoo!"
"Oh, oh."
"Hello. Hello."
"You got to admit... I kind of nailed it."
"All we have to do now is keep the secret forever."
"J-Dog, you cool?"
"No, by the time I got to the piñata,"
"all the candy was gone."
"He's not gonna tell anyone."
"Chidi? Cheedster?"
"What's, uh, happening, buddy?"
"You have a crazy look in your eye,"
"and you're retreating into your shirt."
"You're kind of turtling."
"Henry, are you all right? What happened?"
"I have an aneurysm. Requires emergency surgery."
"Doctor's give me a 50/50 chance."
"So, if there's anything you need to say to me,"
"you should do it now."
"Oh, well..."
"actually, um..."
"They let you wear your boots in here?"
"They're the only things that bring me comfort."
"What did you want to say to me?"
"Oh, um..."
"just that I'm here and I love you, man."
"I love you, too, boot brother."
"Okay."
"Chidi!"
"You didn't have to stay here all night."
"So surgery went well? All clear?"
"Right as rain, buddy."
"That is so, so, so great."
"- I hate your boots. - What?"
"I told you that I loved your boots three years ago,"
"and I was lying,"
"and that lie has haunted me ever since,"
"and people tried to tell me it was fine..."
"just a nice, little white lie in the form of social niceties..."
"but I disagreed, and then yesterday"
"I thought you were gonna die, but now you're not dead,"
"and I can finally be honest"
"and say that those boots are terrible and hideous"
"and I hate them."
"Whoo!"
"This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors."
"Yeah, I know."
"And I get it."
"I don't care that she came back"
"or that we did it for a good reason."
"I can't live with this lie."
"I'm going to confess to the murder of Janet."
"What?"
"Dude, why?"
"Janet is fine."
"We didn't harm her at all."
"We didn't? Hey, Janet?"
"Hello."
"- Hello. - Hello."
"Janet, would you please recite the English alphabet?"
"A-B..."
"Janet."
"She knows her A-B-Janets."
"She literally knew everything in the universe,"
"and now she's a baby."
"And even if she were okay, it would be too painful for me"
"to live with these lies."
"What are you talking about?"
"It is so easy to live with a lie."
"I once pretended to have a terminal illness"
"to meet Scott Wolf at a Sunglass Hut."
"Victimless crime."
"Fine."
"I won't say anything because I promised to help you,"
"and the moral implications..."
"Of everything that we've done are so complicated"
"that I may never untangle them, but I hate lying."
"I always have,"
"and this is going to eat me up inside forever."
"You might be able to shrug this off,"
"and forget about it, but I never will."
"Hello."
"- Hi. - Hello."
"- Hi. - Hello."
"Jianyu!"
"Michael, Janet said you wanted to speak to me."
"Well, actually, she was just drooling a lot"
"and saying ""hello"" over and over again,"
"but she did point at you."
"I owe you an apology."
"Oh, no. No, you don't."
"No, um..."
"but please continue."
"You were only trying to help."
"You're a wonderful person,"
"and if I ever do have a retirement party,"
"I hope you plan it."
"Thank you for gathering, everyone."
"I want to keep you all updated."
"Here's what we know."
"Someone slaughtered Janet."
"Oh, boy."
"- Oh, boy. - Okay, easy."
"I assume that this horrifying act"
"is somehow related to the other issues we've had here."
"It also means"
"that the problems in this neighborhood"
"are not 100% my fault."
"There is something else at work here."
"If anyone has any information"
"about any of this,"
"I beg you,"

"but it's not up to me, is it?"

"There are some criteria"
"that she unfortunately"
""
"just didn't meet in her time on Earth."

"So you think that I should"
"send her to the Bad Place?"

"Well, I didn't say that,"

"It sounds like you want her to leave."

"Should I let her stay?"

"Should I send her away?"

"You think I should send her away?"

"No, I should let her stay?"

"Or no, I shouldn't let her stay"

"Or no, I shouldn't let her stay"

"even though she does belong here?"

"Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom."

"It's a hot dog,"

"Here is your first cut of the profits."

"Holy mama."

"I can't believe you sold the t-shirts."

"Does it help if they"

"Gah, I was hoping you"

"Eleanor."

"Given what you know about the"

"She's definitely one of ours."

"So we'll just roll on out,"

"You didn't trick me."

"You're a really good fake soul mate."

"What are you guys doing here?"

"It's the neighborly thing to do."

"You guys came to say good-bye"
"because you're my friends."

"Well, I... suppose some part of me"

"possibly has a sense"

"- a very short amount of time..."

"I don't care. All right, let's hit it."

"Oh, also, you should smile more."

"- Michael..."

"Want some pizza?"

"Bad Place crew delivered"

"All Hawaiian, the worst pizza."

"Michael, I murdered Janet."

"I knew about Eleanor from the beginning."

"I've been trying to help her"
"become a better person,"

"and when she found out"
"that your retirement meant"

"that you would be tortured,"
"she immediately tried"

"to find a way to prevent it."

"Eleanor is learning."

"She's just doing it after she died."

"I did enjoy her company."

"But, this is not Little League."

"Bro, that's our girl. We agreed on this."

"unchartered territory here."

"Until we can sort this out,"
"she stays with us."

"Pff, all right, fine,"

"and a magazine called ""Celebrity"

"by pushing you out"

"I guess you really botched that one, eh?"

"I did, and I am so, so sorry."

"Oh, we don't know"

"I love you. No need to respond."

"I was flying on the second day,"

"and when you caused the trash storm,"

"I crashed into a rotting"
"turkey carcass, and it exploded."
""
"- Oh, dear."
"- All this"

"cartilage and bone"
"got tangled up in my hair,"

"and its skin was all over my skin."

"Well, if it makes you feel any better,"

"your skin looks amazing."

"My café got destroyed by the giant frog,"

"It seems everyone's"
"problem with me is me."

"Yes, it would appear that way."

"The last moment they were happy"
"was at my party."

"We have to recreate that party."

"We have to take them back"
"to that night before I started"

"affecting the neighborhood"
"and give them a fresh start."

"Yes, of course."

"We must throw the perfect party,"

"This will be the fourth most"

"Janet, there you are."

"I'm sorry, what's going on?"

"Is that a... a wedding ring?"

"Yes."

"I'm married."

"- To whom?"
"- Sorry, my protocol forbids me"

"from telling you any private information"

"about any resident."

"Is it that person?"

"Jianyu, the man standing right there"
"also wearing a wedding band?"
""
"Dad..."
""
"we need to talk."
""
"[tense music]"
""
"I just want to make sure"
"that I have this right."
""
"Um... Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk,"
""
"but rather someone named Jason Mendoza,"
""
"a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida."
""
"I wasn't a failed DJ."
""
"I was pre-successful."
""
"And you two are married."
""
"Hells yeah, homie. We love each other."
""
"She makes the bass drop..."
""
"in my heart."
""
"And Jason is a person who was near me,"
""
"and then he asked me to marry him,"
""
"and there is nothing in my protocol"
""
"that specifically barred"
"that from happening."
""
"- So I agreed."
"- Love you too, babe."
""
"Janet."
""
"Please tell me"
"how this could have happened."
""
"Unclear. As you know,"
"each time I am updated,"
""
"I accrue new knowledge and abilities."
""
"My suspicion is that"
"when I was rebooted,"
""
"I bonded with Jason in a way"
""
"that I have never bonded"
"with anyone before."
""
"I seem to have gained"
"a new understanding of love."
""
"I also learned how to do this."
""
"I will speak to you later."

"Go to your void."

"- Okay."
"- [beep]"

"[quirky music]"

"That is Sachveer,"

"and his problem with me is..."
""
"Oh, one of the giraffes"
"tried to hump him."
""
"[laughs] It's gonna be hard"
"to keep a straight face tonight."
""
"Hey, can I ask your advice on something?"
""
"Are you sure, dude?"
""
"Isn't there someone else"
"better you could ask,"
""
"like literally anyone else?"
""
"Well, it's a sensitive matter,"
"and you... you do know me"
""
"pretty well. So here it is:"
""
"Real Eleanor said she loves me."
""
"Hey, man, nice pull."
"She's a great person."
""
"I don't know what to do."
""
"I mean, we are soul mates,"
"so I probably do love her,"
""
"but then again, how do I know"
"if my motivation is correct?"
""
"Maybe I think I'm supposed to love her,"
""
"but if I tell her that I love"
"her for the wrong reasons,"
""
"it won't mean anything."
""
"You have a tendency"
"to over-think things."
""
"Turn off that giant brain,"
"and just say you love her too."
""
"- You think?"
"- If this were some"
""
"random person you hooked up with"
"at a Diamondbacks game"
""
"in the parking lot behind"
"the port-a-potties..."
""
"not based on a real example..."
"I would say keep mulling,"
""
"but this is your soul mate."
""
"She's Universe-approved."
""
"Tell her you love her."
""
"[beep]"
""
"Hey, your score just went up 20 points."
""
"Yeah, 'cause I give great advice."
""
"Now maybe you'll finally listen to me"
"and take off those glasses."
""
"We are in the afterlife, dummy,"
"nature's Lasik."
""
"♪"
""
"Okay. I think I figured this out."
""
"There is a real Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk"
""
"who took an oath of silence"
"at the age of eight."
""
"But, three months ago,"
""
"he went into such"
"a deep meditative state"
""
"that he registered as dead,"
""
"and when you died at that"
"exact same moment,"
""
"our system mistook you for him."
""
"Perhaps because you share"
"the exact same IQ."
""
"- Cool."
"- No, not cool."
""
"He stopped learning at the age of seven."
""
"Okay, so, now, this is"
"sort of a quick litmus test,"
""
"basic questions designed to tell"
"whether you were"
""
"fundamentally good or bad."
""
"Number one: Did you ever commit"
"a serious crime?"
""
"Yes, I blew up a guy's speedboat"
""
"after he sued me."
""
"[ding] And..."
""
"I stole an old lady's fake leg"
"once on a dare."
""
"[ding]"
""
"Did you ever have"
"a personalized license plate?"
""
"Yeah, dawg."
""
"- ""I LUV BUTTS""."
"- [ding]"
""
"Have... have you ever paid money"
"to hear music performed by"
""
"California funk rock band"
"the Red Hot Chili Peppers?"
""
"Yo, the Chilis?"
""
"I saw them in concert like 50 times."
""
"- [ding]"
"- I once got arrested"
""
"trying to steal Flea's bass guitar."
""
"[ding]"
""
"Oh, that was another"
"serious crime I committed."
""
"I should have mentioned that earlier."
""
"- [beep]"
"- Is it just me,"
""
"or am I acing this test?"
""
"Oh, this is bad."
""
"Oh, this is so, so bad."
""
"Oh, I thought I had"
"everything under control"
""
"when I found Eleanor,"
"but somehow you are..."
""
"you're so much worse."
""
"No, don't... don't touch..."
""
"Oh..."
""
"How does that still work?"
""
"Everything's gonna be fine, homie."
""
"I promise."
""
"[light music]"
""
"I don't know, B."
"What if it doesn't work?"
""
"Hey, we thought of everything"
"except for an alibi"
""
"and an escape route, but"
"we'll figure it out as we go."
""
"You don't wanna over-think these things."
""
"- I'm kinda freaking out here."
"- Pillboi, I got you."
""
"This plan is foolproof."
""
"And when it's over,"
""
"we can finally have"
"the lives we deserve."
""
"♪"
""
"DiGiorno!"
""
"I am a safe installer here"
""
"to install-a da safe."
""
"So just a-point to where"
"the guacamole money is,"
""
"and I'll-a install-a da safe-a"
""
"in da, how you say, a-place?"
""
"[phone dialing]"
""
"Yeah, hi, we're being robbed."
""
"♪"
""
"J, they're on to us, man."
""
"His hat's a golf ball,"
""
"and he's a got a terrible mustache."
""
"We need to get married now."
""
"I do, for always and forever."
""
"I do!"
""
"Eleanor, for an utter novice,"
"you have thrown a lovely party."
""
"Well, thanks, but it's not working."
""
"Not one more point."
""
"What the fork?"
""
"Oh, look, Michael's here. He can help."
""
"Michael, would you do us"
"the honor of saying a few words?"
""
"I don't know that"
"I'm in the right frame of mind."
""
"Please, they'll listen to you."
""
"Just pay me a few compliments."
""
"You know, I'm great,"
"heart of a champion,"
""
"basically your muse, you get it."
""
"[party chatter]"
""
"Attention, everyone."
""
"Michael would like to say a few words."

"Hello, everyone."
"Good to see you all here,"
""
"mingling around with"
"your various secrets."
""
"Who really knows which of you"
"are who you say you are?"
""
"No way to know unless I pull"
"your skeletons out, right?"
""
"Okay."
""
"Take her easy."
""
"Yes, well said."
""
"Now, we shall hear from"
"tonight's featured guest."
""
"She's kind, she's humble,"
""
"she's the Walmart of friends."
""
"Did I use that word right?"
""
"Eleanor Shellstrop."
""
"[sparse applause]"
""
"Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor."
""
"Original flavor, not new and improved."
""
"I know a lot of bad stuff"
"has happened because of me,"
""
"but I never meant to hurt you,"
""
"so if I caused you any harm,"
""
"I'm truly sorry."
""
"That's nice, Eleanor,"
""
"but I still crashed into"
"a turkey carcass."
""
"And I fell into a sinkhole."
""
"And my dog got kicked into the sun."
""
"What can you possibly say to us"
""
"that'll make up for your actions?"
""
"Pobody's nerfect?"
""
"[chuckles]"
""
"[chuckling spreads]"
""
"""Pobody's nerfect""? That's hilarious."
""
"Like ""nobody's perfect,"""
"but the letters switched."
""
"- That's very funny."
"- It's nerfect!"
""
"[all laughing]"
""
"[quirky music]"
""
"Eleanor, great job tonight."
""
"Have you checked the, uh, the ticker?"
""
"I could really use some good news."
""
"Okay. [exhales]"
""
"Gah, come on."
""
"Well, the nightmare continues."
""
"The nightmare continues."
""
"How did this not work?"
""
"There's no way"
"to increase my point total"
""
"because everything I'm doing"
"is out of self-preservation."
""
"- I don't understand."
"- My motivation is corrupt."
""
"Even when I do nice things,"
"I'm only doing them"
""
"so I can get something out of it,"
""
"the ability to stay here,"
""
"which means none of this"
"had any real moral value."
""
"It doesn't count."
""
"♪"
""
"Holy shirt."
""
"I know what I have to do."
""
"Okay, I am almost done"
"with these personalized"
""
"""I'm sorry"" notes to everyone"
"in the neighborhood."
""
"I need you guys to deliver"
"everyone their notes,"
""
"along with those T-shirts."
""
"Well, granted, these are hilarious,"
""
"but how is this going to help?"
""
"Just trust me."
""
"I'm gonna get the points."
""
"[quirky music]"
""
"♪"
""
"Oh, good morning, Dad. Where you been?"
""
"Oh, just walking around,"
"contemplating my failure,"
""
"wishing for the sweet release"
"of eternal extinction."
""
"Cool."
""
"Hey, um..."
""
"why don't you want me to see Janet?"
""
"I'm a good guy."
""
"All I want is to give Janet"
"the life she deserves."
""
"Janet is not built for human life,"
""
"and I'm not sure"
"you're much of a provider."
""
"Do you even remember how you died?"
""
"No, not really."
""
"It's a little fuzzy."
""
"You and your friend Pillboi"
"were trying to rob a restaurant."
""
"Pillboi!"
""
"And then the cops showed up."
""
"♪"
""
"So the plan was to pretend"
"to install a safe"
""
"with your friend hiding inside it."
""
"He pops out, steals the money"
"from the restaurant,"
""
"gets back in the safe, then"
"you come in and uninstall it."
""
"I refuse to discuss"
"my fifth amendment rights"
""
"until I concur with your attorney."
""
"Sure."
""
"Look, we found your buddy's plans."
""
"We know he was the... brains."
""
"You were just an accomplice."
""
"If you're lucky,"
"you might get probation."
""
"- Jason going to jail?"
"- No, man."
""
"Jason's dead."
"He suffocated in that safe."
""
"There were no air holes."
""
"Plus he did a bunch of whippits"
"while he was in there,"
""
"which couldn't have helped."
""
"At least he died doing what he loved..."
""
"a bunch of whippits."
""
"Now he's never gonna get"
"the life he truly deserved."
""
"Eh, I think he got"
"roughly what he deserved."
""
"I suffocated to death in... in a safe?"
""
"I'm a moron."
""
"Hey... hey, Janet?"
""
"- [beep]"
"- Hi, there."
""
"- Janet, you need to leave me."
"- Why?"
""
"You're the smartest girl in the world..."
""
"- I'm not a girl."
"- And your dad is an angel."
""
"I mean, what a family."
""
"I'm just a dope who died in a safe"
""
"with a snorkel..."
""
"who's only now realizing"
""
"why that didn't work."
""
"You should be with someone better."
""
"I don't deserve you."
""
"Jason, you are all that I care about,"
""
"possibly because I did not"
"have the capacity to care"
""
"about anything before you."
""
"I love you."
""
"Also, interesting sidenote,"
""
"I think I might hate things now, too."
""
"So far, it's genocide"
"and leggings as pants."
""
"This is nuts."
""
"Just weighing in over here."
""
"This is bonkers."
""
"Okay, I have to go reboot Janet."
""
"- Why?"
"- It's the only thing"
""
"I can think of to do"
"to get rid of this glitch."
""
"Yo, who you calling a glitch?"
""
"It means ""error,"" Jason,"
"which is what this is."
""
"Oh, really? Is it an error"
""
"to act unpredictably and behave in ways"
""
"that run counter to how you were"
""
"programmed to behave?"
""
"Yes."
""
"Now, you two sit tight."
""
"I'm gonna go murder Janet,"
"and I'll be right back."
""
"Look on the bright side."
""
"When you're rebooted,"
""
"I can teach you"
"all the Dorito flavors again."
""
"No. I'm not starting over."
""
"What if he reboots me,"
"and we fall out of love?"
""
"We have to get out of here right now."
""
"♪"
""
"Where do you suppose she is?"
""
"I hope she's okay."
""
"You know, the more I work on her case,"
""
"the more I think she truly belongs here."
""
"I'm... I'm sorry that"
"I haven't been able to say..."
""
"what you want me to say,"
""
"because I-I do want to say it."
""
"What's holding you back?"
""
"Honestly, my biggest fear"
"is just making sure"
""
"that my motivation for saying it..."
""
"Chidi?"
""
"♪"
""
"- Wow."
"- How did she suddenly...?"
""
"Her motivation changed."
""
"She couldn't earn enough points"
"by apologizing to everyone here"
""
"because she was only doing it to"
"earn enough points to stay here."
""
"But she did earn enough points,"
""
"which means that"
"she's decided not to stay here,"
""
"- which means..."
"- That she's leaving."
""
"[tense music]"
""
"Oh, hey, Janet."
"I was just about to call you"
""
"to ask you to get me"
"a train to the Bad Place."
""
"- Whoa, what?"
"- You have to be a good person"
""
"to stay here, and I can't become"
"a good person unless I leave."
""
"You don't belong here,"
""
"Jason doesn't belong here,"
""
"and now that I can think and feel,"
"I don't belong here either."
""
"- Where are you going with this?"
"- There is a woman named Mindy St. Clair"
""
"who lives in a neutral zone by herself."
""
"It's neither a Good Place"
"nor a Bad Place."
""
"A Medium Place?"
""
"Dude, that's where I belong."

"I've been saying that since day one."

"It's where Jason and I are going."

"Would you like to come"
"with us to Mindy's house?"

"Yeah. Let's go hang with Mindy."

"That sounds great. Love her, huge fan."

"Call the train."

"Look, there it is now."

"[brakes squealing]"

"That train belongs to Shawn,"

"Because they won't even know"

"After I came up"

"You had no idea I was gonna do that,"

"because honestly, I had"
"no idea I was gonna do that,"

"Yeah, that came out of nowhere."

"I mean, after that it was just"
"a crazy scramble for all of us."

"You know, I definitely underestimated"

"how effective Chidi was gonna be,"

"teaching you to be good,"

"and obviously, we didn't anticipate"

"that Janet would"
"fall in love with Jason."

"Hang on. That part is real."

"Oh, yeah. Janet isn't one of us."

"No, she's sort of a..."

"Wait, I don't get something."

"I know why Jason and I were"

"Uh, $60 billion, actually, so."

"Oh."
""
"But it didn't matter..."

"because my motivations were corrupt."

"I didn't care about helping"

"I just wanted to prove my parents wrong,"

"stick it to my sister,"

"My only real goal"

"was to snog Ryan Gosling"

"But wait, why is Chidi here?"

"Well, uh..."

"there's something"
"you don't know about me."

"I read an article saying"
"that growing almonds"

"was bad for the environment,"
"and yet I continued to use"

"- almond milk in my coffee..."
"- No, dingus!"

"Oh, fork!"

"You're right."

"Every friend, every girlfriend"

"because I had already promised"
"my landlord's nephew"

"that I would help him"

"Well, if it'll make you feel any better,"

"you were the closest to actually"

"You weren't that close."
"You were just the closest."

"That makes me feel worse, somehow."

"Good. Thank you, Chidi."

"I really needed to hear that right now."

"I mean, all this hard work,"
"all the planning,"

"all for nothing."

"This really sucks."

"No, it doesn't."

"You saw us all on Earth..."

"Side note, I might legit be into Tahani."

"So, the only thing"
"you succeeded in doing"
