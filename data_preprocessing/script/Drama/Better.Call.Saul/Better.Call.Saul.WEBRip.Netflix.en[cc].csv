00:03:04.018,00:03:06.061,"Yeah, that is some detail."
00:03:06.061,00:03:09.773,That is some Western detail right there. Western detail.
00:03:09.773,00:03:11.775,Attention to detail.
00:03:09.773,00:03:13.568,"He's even got the spurs on the back of his boots, and they're sharp."
00:03:13.568,00:03:15.737,"WOMAN 2: Ha, ha. Love it."
00:03:15.737,00:03:18.157,"The clock is gone on this piece, Christine, so..."
00:03:18.157,00:03:20.659,"WOMAN 2: Oh, my goodness."
00:03:20.659,00:03:24.621,"WOMAN 2: Well, from time to time, people make mistakes, that's okay."
00:03:24.621,00:03:27.166,This is our first Renoir of the evening.
00:03:27.166,00:03:29.877,"This is a heliogravure, which is an etching."
00:03:29.877,00:03:32.921,It was hand pulled from a copperplate in Paris in 1919.
00:03:32.921,00:03:37.801,We know this because that's what it says on the back where the certificate of authenticity is located.
00:03:37.801,00:03:39.469,Just as lovely as can be.
00:03:39.469,00:03:42.347,"Look at the soft, delicate shading, very feminine."
00:03:42.347,00:03:44.265,This is a limited edition.
00:03:44.265,00:03:47.602,This is what you're looking for if you are a Renoir fan.
00:03:47.602,00:03:50.313,"WOMAN 1: One hundred, oh, my goodness."
00:03:50.313,00:03:51.648,WOMAN 2: Whoo! Good.
00:03:51.648,00:04:05.370,"--of the few exceptions is the African pancake tortoise, which has a flat, flexible shell that allows it to hide in rock crevasses-- MAN 2: --big swath of light to moderate snow from the Broken Bow area down toward Kearney, Hastings, Grand Island."
00:04:05.370,00:04:17.340,"That is all moving in our direction, so I do think around 7 to 8:00 the snow will become pretty steady here across the region with all this moving on top of us, and that's really gonna knock down visibility."
00:04:17.340,00:04:24.014,"And again, snow-covered roads are gonna be definitely likely this evening, making it even slippier-- More slippery."
00:04:24.014,00:04:25.766,--than it is out there at this time.
00:04:25.766,00:04:30.270,There's that winter weather advisory in effect till very early tomorrow morning.
00:04:34.733,00:04:40.280,The bitter cold weather helped break up the compactions we created this fall in our fields.
00:05:24.992,00:05:29.412,Don't let false allegations bully you into an unfair fight.
00:05:29.412,00:05:33.125,"Hi, I'm Saul Goodman, and I will do the fighting for you."
00:05:33.125,00:05:34.918,No charge is too big for me.
00:05:34.918,00:05:39.840,"When legal forces have you cornered, better call Saul."
00:05:39.840,00:05:41.842,I'll get your case dismissed.
00:05:41.842,00:05:44.261,I'll give you the defense you deserve.
00:05:44.261,00:05:47.514,"Why? Because I'm Saul Goodman, attorney at law."
00:05:47.514,00:05:52.644,"I investigate, advocate, persuade, and most importantly, win."
00:05:52.644,00:05:55.730,Better call Saul.
00:05:55.730,00:05:57.356,Do you feel doomed?
00:05:57.356,00:05:59.609,Have opponents of freedom wrongly intimidated you?
00:05:59.609,00:06:04.781,"Maybe they told you you're in serious trouble, and there's nothing you can do."
00:06:01.695,00:06:06.658,"I'm Saul Goodman, and I'm here to tell you that they're wrong."
00:06:06.658,00:07:46.174,It's never too late for justice. Better call-- JIMMY: I think...
00:07:46.174,00:07:49.803,your brain is just not all there yet.
00:07:49.803,00:07:54.224,If we were all held responsible for what we did when we were 19...
00:07:56.351,00:08:00.897,I remember what it was like to be a kid. Think back.
00:08:02.232,00:08:05.402,"It's all-- Judge, what would you say?"
00:08:05.402,00:08:12.867,"These boys, 19, I can't-- I don't-- These three young men, just like you."
00:08:12.867,00:08:14.369,Just like...
00:08:14.369,00:08:15.703,Psst.
00:08:30.344,00:08:34.222,"Oh, to be 19 again. You with me, ladies and gentlemen?"
00:08:34.222,00:08:36.599,Do you remember 19?
00:08:36.599,00:08:47.694,"Let me tell you, the juices are flowing, the red corpuscles are corpuscling, the grass is green and it's soft, and summer's gonna last forever."
00:08:49.654,00:08:52.866,Now do you remember?
00:08:52.866,00:09:01.416,"Ahem. But if you're being honest, I mean, really honest, you'll recall that you also had an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain."
00:09:01.416,00:09:11.592,"Me, personally, heh, if I were held accountable for some of the stupid decisions I made when I was 19, oh-ho, boy, wow."
00:09:11.592,00:09:15.847,"And I bet if we were in church right now, I'd get a big amen."
00:09:15.847,00:09:18.641,Which brings us to these three.
00:09:18.641,00:09:24.856,"Now, these three knuckleheads-- And I'm sorry, boys, but that's what you are."
00:09:24.856,00:09:27.192,--they did a dumb thing.
00:09:27.192,00:09:30.695,"However, I would like you to remember two salient facts."
00:09:30.695,00:09:33.073,"Fact one, nobody got hurt."
00:09:33.073,00:09:36.493,Not a soul. Very important to keep that in mind.
00:09:36.493,00:09:38.495,Fact two.
00:09:38.495,00:09:43.417,"Now, the prosecution keeps bandying this term criminal trespass."
00:09:43.417,00:09:52.384,"Mr. Spinauzo, the property owner, admitted to us that he keeps most portions of his business open to the public both day and night."
00:09:52.384,00:09:56.430,So trespassing?
00:09:56.430,00:09:58.723,"It's a bit of a reach, don't you think, Dave?"
00:10:00.225,00:10:02.060,Here's what I know.
00:10:02.060,00:10:11.445,"These three young men, near honor students all, were feeling their oats one Saturday night and they just..."
00:10:11.445,00:10:13.488,went a little bananas.
00:10:13.488,00:10:25.208,"I don't know. Call me crazy, but I don't think they deserve to have their bright futures ruined by a momentary, minute, never-to-be-repeated lapse of judgment."
00:10:25.208,00:10:28.002,Ladies and gentlemen...
00:10:28.002,00:10:30.464,you're bigger than that.
00:11:27.103,00:11:29.606,"BOY 1: Kenny, are you rolling?"
00:11:29.606,00:11:32.108,"Yeah, baby. Yeah. Ha, ha."
00:11:32.108,00:11:33.818,"Chill out, would you?"
00:11:33.818,00:11:38.156,"Hey, Miss Watson's fourth period biology class, this one's for you."
00:11:38.156,00:11:40.450,"KENNY: Oh, yeah."
00:11:40.450,00:11:42.577,"KENNY: Oh, God."
00:11:42.577,00:11:44.538,"BOY 2: Dude, where'd all the blood go?"
00:11:44.538,00:11:46.914,BOY 1: He's dead.
00:11:46.914,00:11:48.791,BOY 2: Awesome. Where do they put it?
00:11:48.791,00:11:51.461,"BOY 2: All right, I'm through the neck bone now, dude."
00:11:51.461,00:11:53.380,"Kenny, get over here."
00:11:53.380,00:11:56.090,BOY 1: Get a shot of this.
00:11:56.090,00:11:58.343,"BOY 2: Here, let me do it."
00:11:58.343,00:11:59.886,All right.
00:11:59.886,00:12:01.846,All right.
00:12:01.846,00:12:03.973,BOY 2: You're sawing like a pussy.
00:12:03.973,00:12:05.808,BOY 1: Would you get off? Chill out.
00:12:05.808,00:12:07.394,BOY 2: All right.
00:12:07.394,00:12:09.688,Okay.
00:12:12.691,00:12:15.402,Yeah!
00:12:15.402,00:12:18.697,"Come on. Yeah, baby. Yeah."
00:12:18.697,00:12:21.324,BOY 2: I dare you to stick your wang in the throat hole.
00:12:21.324,00:12:23.284,"BOY 1: I will if you will, loser."
00:12:23.284,00:12:25.579,"BOY 2: All right, all right."
00:12:25.579,00:12:27.414,JIMMY: What the hell kind of math is that?
00:12:27.414,00:12:28.956,WOMAN: Seven hundred per defense.
00:12:28.956,00:12:31.459,"No, no, no. Defendant."
00:12:31.459,00:12:33.044,"Three defendants, 2100."
00:12:33.044,00:12:35.714,"Which, by the way, bargain."
00:12:35.714,00:12:37.756,"WOMAN: They going to jail, ain't they?"
00:12:37.756,00:12:41.928,So since when does that matter?
00:12:41.928,00:12:44.931,"Look, didn't nobody tell you to try all three of them together."
00:12:44.931,00:12:47.766,"One trial, $700."
00:12:47.766,00:12:52.897,You are gonna miss me because it'll be a cold day in hell before I do any more PD work for this shitty court.
00:12:52.897,00:12:54.524,"Sayonara, baby."
00:12:54.524,00:12:57.193,You have yourself a nice day.
00:13:21.551,00:13:24.763,"Law offices of James McGill, how may I direct your call?"
00:13:24.763,00:13:28.516,"Yes, Mrs. Kettleman, so good of you to return."
00:13:28.516,00:13:36.107,"Actually, I don't have Mr. McGill at the moment, but I know he-- Oh, splendid."
00:13:36.107,00:13:40.612,"Uh, unfortunately, our offices are being painted, and the fumes are quite horrid."
00:13:40.612,00:13:45.866,"Could he meet you and your husband at, say, uh, Loyola's Café on Central?"
00:13:47.577,00:13:51.122,Four o'clock it shall be.
00:14:24.947,00:14:27.367,MIKE: Ahem. Three dollars.
00:14:27.367,00:14:29.744,"Uh, I'm validated."
00:14:29.744,00:14:33.456,"Well, I see five stickers."
00:14:34.749,00:14:39.379,"They gave me-- Look, I'm validated for the entire day, okay?"
00:14:39.379,00:14:42.590,"Five stickers, six stickers, I don't know from stickers because..."
00:14:42.590,00:14:47.011,"I was in that court back there saving people's lives, so..."
00:14:47.011,00:14:48.888,"Gee, that's swell."
00:14:48.888,00:14:52.266,And thank you for restoring my faith in the judicial system.
00:14:52.266,00:14:57.938,"Now, you either pay the $3, or you go back inside and you get an additional sticker."
00:14:59.148,00:15:01.609,Son of a bitch.
00:15:02.652,00:15:05.071,Fine. You win.
00:15:06.489,00:15:09.450,Backing up. I have to back up.
00:15:09.450,00:15:11.285,Don't have enough stickers.
00:15:11.285,00:15:14.997,Thank you. Thank you. Very nice.
00:15:21.755,00:15:23.715,Employee of the month over here.
00:15:23.715,00:15:27.510,Yeah. Hooray. Give him a medal.
00:15:27.510,00:15:31.472,"Don't do anything, guys."
00:15:31.472,00:15:36.644,"Well, I'm just fuzzy as to why you think he needs a lawyer."
00:15:36.644,00:15:41.023,"I mean, Craig, the way you run your office is beyond reproach."
00:15:41.023,00:15:42.400,Beyond reproach.
00:15:42.400,00:15:45.695,"I'm a stickler, you know-- He is. He's a stickler with the money."
00:15:45.695,00:15:47.739,He's definitely a stickler.
00:15:47.739,00:15:53.035,He's certainly not guilty of some-- Certainly not.
00:15:49.616,00:15:54.871,"He's innocent of any wrongdoing, that's abundantly clear to me."
00:15:54.871,00:15:58.207,"And frankly, I don't go looking for guilty people to represent."
00:15:58.207,00:16:00.960,"I mean, who needs that aggravation, right?"
00:16:00.960,00:16:02.670,"Ha, ha."
00:16:02.670,00:16:05.840,"Look, all I know is what I read in the paper."
00:16:05.840,00:16:12.054,"And typically when money goes missing from the county treasury-- And the number here is, uh, 1.6 million?"
00:16:12.054,00:16:14.348,"BOTH: Well, that's an accounting discrepancy."
00:16:14.348,00:16:19.103,"It's a discrepancy, absolutely."
00:16:14.348,00:16:21.188,But typically when that happens the police look at the treasurer.
00:16:21.188,00:16:24.776,"And since that person is, uh..."
00:16:26.193,00:16:29.238,I just think a little proactivity may be in order.
00:16:29.238,00:16:32.366,I just think I'd look guilty if I hired a lawyer.
00:16:32.366,00:16:34.076,Yeah.
00:16:32.366,00:16:39.081,"Actually, it's getting arrested that makes people look guilty, even the innocent ones."
00:16:39.081,00:16:41.208,And innocent people get arrested every day.
00:16:41.208,00:16:47.548,And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he's their best friend.
00:16:47.548,00:16:50.510,"Talk to me, he says."
00:16:50.510,00:16:53.137,"You don't need a lawyer, only guilty people need lawyers."
00:16:53.137,00:16:56.390,"And, boom, hey, that's when it all goes south."
00:16:56.390,00:16:58.559,That's when you want someone in your corner.
00:16:58.559,00:17:01.896,Someone who will fight tooth and nail.
00:17:01.896,00:17:05.191,"Lawyers, we're like health insurance."
00:17:05.191,00:17:08.778,"You hope you never need it, but, man, oh, man, not having it? No."
00:17:10.029,00:17:11.948,Phew.
00:17:11.948,00:17:15.034,"How, ahem, would we proceed if we decided to, uh--?"
00:17:15.034,00:17:18.746,"Oh. Well, this is a letter of engagement."
00:17:18.746,00:17:20.581,"It's very simple, straightforward."
00:17:20.581,00:17:21.958,"Please, uh, read it closely."
00:17:21.958,00:17:30.508,"But if you sign it, um, I can get started on that defense strategy of ours this very afternoon."
00:17:44.731,00:17:50.319,"BETSY: Craig, I think maybe we should sleep on it."
00:17:50.319,00:17:53.907,"Uh, sure."
00:17:53.907,00:17:57.076,"Don't you think, Mr. McGill?"
00:17:57.076,00:17:59.913,"Oh, please, call me Jimmy. Heh."
00:17:59.913,00:18:02.665,Absolutely.
00:18:02.665,00:18:06.711,"Oh, and you know, Craig, we gotta pick up the kids."
00:18:06.711,00:18:08.254,CRAIG: Oh. Right.
00:18:08.254,00:18:09.672,BETSY: Yeah.
00:18:09.672,00:18:12.466,"Well, uh, we will be in touch."
00:18:12.466,00:18:16.220,"Uh, thank you for the coffee, and for the advice."
00:18:16.220,00:18:19.098,"You're very, very welcome."
00:18:19.098,00:18:24.020,"Here. Take this. It's, uh, got my phone number on it."
00:18:24.020,00:18:27.774,BETSY: Yeah. Okay.
00:18:38.451,00:18:49.545,"The number is 9456, 0054, 4896, 0643, and the expiration is 11, '04."
00:18:49.545,00:18:52.632,"Okay, and the key word here is classy, all right?"
00:18:52.632,00:18:54.300,Super classy.
00:18:54.300,00:18:58.846,"Use only flowers that look expensive, but, you know, aren't."
00:18:58.846,00:19:03.309,"Uh, and the note should say: Dear Betsy and Craig."
00:19:03.309,00:19:08.564,"Uh, best wishes from your stickler for justice, James McGill."
00:19:08.564,00:19:13.235,"Okay? And McGill is spelled M-C-- Well, run it again."
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.571,"Well, no, no, no. It's paid up."
00:19:13.235,00:19:29.877,"Run it again-- SKATER 2: Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God."
00:19:29.877,00:19:33.047,"Oh, my God, Cal."
00:19:33.047,00:19:35.508,"Buddy, look at me."
00:19:35.508,00:19:38.177,What did you do?
00:19:38.177,00:19:39.846,Why don't you look where you're going?
00:19:39.846,00:19:41.388,He came out of nowhere.
00:19:41.388,00:19:43.557,"You freaking hit him, man."
00:19:43.557,00:19:46.310,You ran over my brother.
00:19:46.310,00:19:48.855,I got the whole thing on video.
00:19:48.855,00:19:50.272,It was an accident.
00:19:48.855,00:19:52.733,He didn't-- He didn't mean to.
00:19:52.733,00:19:55.028,It's broke. Is it broke?
00:19:55.028,00:19:56.696,You broke his leg.
00:19:56.696,00:19:58.447,Why you driving around and not looking?
00:19:58.447,00:20:00.324,Driving around breaking people's legs.
00:20:00.324,00:20:01.617,Okay.
00:20:01.617,00:20:03.494,Don't call the police.
00:20:03.494,00:20:06.330,JIMMY: Don't call the police.
00:20:06.330,00:20:09.167,Call them myself.
00:20:09.167,00:20:10.501,Don't call the cops?
00:20:10.501,00:20:12.045,How you gonna fix this?
00:20:12.045,00:20:14.588,What are you gonna do to make things right?
00:20:20.553,00:20:22.429,"I don't know, fellas."
00:20:22.429,00:20:25.975,What can I do to make it right?
00:20:33.024,00:20:35.068,I don't know.
00:20:36.152,00:20:38.779,Five hundred dollars.
00:20:39.697,00:20:42.950,Five hundred bucks? Yeah?
00:20:42.950,00:20:44.660,Yeah.
00:20:46.204,00:20:49.040,"Ow. What the hell, man?"
00:20:49.040,00:20:53.335,"I'm gonna give you a 9.6 for technique, 0.0 for choice of victim."
00:20:53.335,00:20:55.462,I'm a lawyer.
00:20:55.462,00:21:00.634,"Furthermore, does this steaming pile of crap scream payday to you, huh?"
00:21:00.634,00:21:05.806,The only way that entire car is worth 500 bucks is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it.
00:21:05.806,00:21:09.643,"Now, let's talk about what you owe me for the windshield."
00:21:15.482,00:21:17.484,I'll take a check.
00:21:25.451,00:21:28.079,"Chào cô, ladies."
00:21:29.997,00:21:33.834,"Chào cô, Mrs. Nguyen."
00:21:33.834,00:21:35.878,My mail?
00:21:35.878,00:21:38.923,You work for people who have sex with chopped-off head?
00:21:38.923,00:21:42.718,Was it in the paper?
00:21:42.718,00:21:45.345,Why? Why you work for these people?
00:21:45.345,00:21:48.641,"Ahem. Just lucky, I guess."
00:21:48.641,00:21:51.727,Cucumber water for customer only.
00:22:42.987,00:22:47.783,FEMALE VOICE: You have zero messages.
00:24:27.967,00:24:30.468,"Brenda, looking good."
00:24:30.468,00:24:33.180,"Nice 'do. Uh, where's Lord Vader?"
00:24:33.180,00:24:35.182,He's not quite ready for you yet.
00:24:35.182,00:24:37.101,South conference room.
00:24:37.101,00:24:40.938,How about you wait out here?
00:24:40.938,00:24:43.065,"Oh, Sir Francis."
00:24:43.065,00:24:45.401,James.
00:24:45.401,00:24:47.903,Okay.
00:24:53.033,00:24:56.162,"Keith, Karen. Yes."
00:25:01.792,00:25:09.633,"You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin, and I won't have it."
00:25:09.633,00:25:12.261,Do you want me to call security?
00:25:12.261,00:25:14.554,"It's okay, Brenda."
00:25:14.554,00:25:16.807,"JIMMY: Hey, Jack."
00:25:16.807,00:25:18.976,"What can we do for you, Jimmy?"
00:25:18.976,00:25:22.396,"I'm sorry, it's this table."
00:25:22.396,00:25:24.940,Something just comes over me.
00:25:30.737,00:25:35.659,"You can tell me what this, uh, 26,000 is supposed to be for."
00:25:35.659,00:25:38.829,That's money for Chuck.
00:25:38.829,00:25:41.499,A measly 26 grand?
00:25:41.499,00:25:44.001,"Heh. Jesus, you're like Peter Minuit with the Indians."
00:25:44.001,00:25:46.462,Throw in some beads and shells while you're at it.
00:25:46.462,00:25:48.130,"It's just a start, there'll be more."
00:25:48.130,00:25:50.383,Unless you're gonna just tear them all up.
00:25:50.383,00:25:53.302,And why was it made out to me?
00:25:53.302,00:25:54.845,Can he make his way to the bank?
00:25:57.431,00:26:00.851,I just assumed it was best to have the money go through you.
00:26:00.851,00:26:03.270,We can do it any way you want.
00:26:03.270,00:26:05.356,"This isn't going away, Howard."
00:26:05.356,00:26:12.696,"What Chuck did for this firm, and damn near single-handedly, one-third of this place belongs to him. Yeah."
00:26:12.696,00:26:14.323,"What have you got, 12 chairs here?"
00:26:14.323,00:26:16.658,Four of these chairs are Chuck's.
00:26:16.658,00:26:24.791,"You got five of these light thingamajigs, uh, one and two-thirds are Chuck's. Yeah."
00:26:24.791,00:26:26.460,How many Danishes?
00:26:26.460,00:26:28.087,You can have all the Danish you want.
00:26:28.087,00:26:30.089,"No, no."
00:26:30.089,00:26:36.887,"And Chuck isn't greedy, so he'll just take two, plus $17 million."
00:26:36.887,00:26:40.682,"I mean, we'll know once we get the accountants poking around here."
00:26:40.682,00:26:46.272,"Until then, no more penny ante checks designed to make it look like Chuck still works here."
00:26:46.272,00:26:47.856,He never will again.
00:26:47.856,00:26:50.484,It's time to do right by him and cash him out.
00:26:50.484,00:26:53.904,So these are Chuck's own wishes that you're conveying?
00:26:53.904,00:26:56.365,This is what's best for him.
00:26:56.365,00:27:00.244,So he personally told you that it's his wish to withdraw from the firm?
00:27:03.330,00:27:05.416,"See, that would surprise me."
00:27:05.416,00:27:07.876,It's been nearly a year since he set foot in here.
00:27:07.876,00:27:10.087,I'm just doing what's in his best interests.
00:27:10.087,00:27:14.632,"So am I. And I, for one, believe he's gonna lick this thing."
00:27:14.632,00:27:17.303,"Until then, his office is just as he left it."
00:27:17.303,00:27:18.845,His secretary is still on payroll.
00:27:18.845,00:27:22.933,"If Chuck can call this an extended sabbatical, then so can we."
00:27:22.933,00:27:26.853,You know what?
00:27:26.853,00:27:29.689,"Yeah. They're gonna love you, Howard."
00:27:29.689,00:27:32.776,You're so down to earth and relatable.
00:27:34.652,00:27:39.408,And you will atone.
00:27:41.994,00:27:44.288,It's Ned Beatty from Network.
00:27:44.288,00:27:47.416,"For chrissakes, guys."
00:27:55.591,00:27:58.093,Jimmy.
00:27:58.093,00:28:01.639,I almost forgot.
00:28:01.639,00:28:03.641,You can save me the postage.
00:28:03.641,00:28:06.852,Weren't you listening in there?
00:28:06.852,00:28:09.188,Think I'm gonna help you establish a paper trail?
00:28:09.188,00:28:12.274,Jimmy-- Stop trying to pawn that shit off on him.
00:28:12.274,00:28:14.026,Jimmy.
00:28:14.026,00:28:24.702,"You know, Jimmy, sometimes in our line of work, you can get so caught up in the idea of winning that you forget to listen to your heart."
00:28:26.872,00:28:30.668,"Give Chuck my love, would you?"
00:28:33.546,00:28:38.300,"Oh, there you are."
00:28:38.300,00:28:42.762,"BETSY: Hi. Oh, Craig, you need your own purse."
00:28:42.762,00:28:45.307,HOWARD: Did it work out?
00:28:49.520,00:28:50.979,It was very nice.
00:28:50.979,00:28:53.273,You look lovely today.
00:30:08.515,00:30:11.602,Couldn't you just--?
00:31:34.727,00:31:36.562,JIMMY: Son of a bitch.
00:31:36.562,00:31:40.940,CHUCK: You ground yourself?
00:32:37.956,00:32:40.333,JIMMY: You gotta stop putting bacon on the list.
00:32:40.333,00:32:44.296,That cooler's looking like a trichinosis stew.
00:32:44.296,00:32:45.631,Perfect timing.
00:32:49.342,00:32:51.637,Professor Brans Vogelson?
00:32:51.637,00:32:53.221,University of Helsinki?
00:32:53.221,00:32:55.724,"Yeah, you're gonna have to get that translated."
00:32:55.724,00:32:58.602,Into Swedish?
00:32:58.602,00:33:02.522,"Finish, uh, translating into--?"
00:33:02.522,00:33:05.943,I'm sure there's someone at UNM who can do that.
00:33:05.943,00:33:08.654,You do know I'm trying to start a legal practice?
00:33:08.654,00:33:17.078,Vogelson's been working on the effects of electromagnetic fields on zebrafish and-- Oh. Financial Times.
00:33:17.078,00:33:20.248,"Yeah, I knew you missed it, so I figured, what the heck?"
00:33:20.248,00:33:24.294,Thank you. I know it's expensive here.
00:33:24.294,00:33:27.506,That's not-- I don't expect you to go out-of-pocket.
00:33:27.506,00:33:30.216,"Go ahead, reimburse yourself."
00:33:32.845,00:33:34.847,Thanks.
00:33:34.847,00:33:38.183,"Hey, Chuck, uh, can you not read that for second?"
00:33:38.183,00:33:40.226,Can we talk?
00:33:43.480,00:33:45.816,Are you all right?
00:33:45.816,00:33:47.651,I'm fine.
00:33:49.402,00:33:51.530,You're not in trouble?
00:33:53.072,00:33:55.074,Um...
00:33:55.074,00:33:57.828,You gotta cash out.
00:33:57.828,00:34:00.038,You gotta.
00:34:00.038,00:34:01.748,There's no other way.
00:34:01.748,00:34:04.877,"I know that you don't wanna hear it, but you've got to."
00:34:04.877,00:34:07.295,You know I'm going to beat this.
00:34:07.295,00:34:09.339,You know I'm going to get better.
00:34:10.507,00:34:12.091,"Yeah, sure."
00:34:12.091,00:34:14.135,"Well, then there's nothing more to talk about."
00:34:14.135,00:34:20.266,"I will beat this. Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci."
00:34:20.266,00:34:21.768,Meaning...
00:34:20.266,00:34:23.144,That's not-- Meaning.
00:34:23.144,00:34:26.439,That's the one about false principles-- You proceed from false principles.
00:34:26.439,00:34:29.526,"Your argument is built on quicksand, therefore it collapses."
00:34:29.526,00:34:31.236,"Yeah, you're not listening."
00:34:31.236,00:34:36.115,Ah. Fine. Let's take this to its logical conclusion.
00:34:37.325,00:34:42.080,"In order to pay out my share, suppose my partners are forced to liquidate the firm."
00:34:42.080,00:34:43.916,Then what?
00:34:43.916,00:34:46.334,My clients are out in the cold.
00:34:46.334,00:34:50.923,"My cases are scattered to the winds, 126 people lose their jobs."
00:34:50.923,00:34:53.132,What happens to your cronies in the mailroom?
00:34:53.132,00:34:57.429,"The assistants, paralegals, the janitorial staff, all of them out on the street."
00:34:57.429,00:34:59.806,"Your friend Kim, a promising career, over and done with."
00:34:59.806,00:35:02.141,Hamlin owes you everything.
00:35:02.141,00:35:06.521,You built that place singlehandedly while he was at Four Hills working on his bunker shot.
00:35:06.521,00:35:08.982,Let's not exaggerate. I helped.
00:35:10.316,00:35:14.863,All the more reason not to tear it down just for a little bit of cash.
00:35:14.863,00:35:16.990,"Chuck, I'm going under."
00:35:16.990,00:35:22.955,"For the third time, with these bull-crap contract counsel-- Bull crap?"
00:35:20.493,00:35:24.873,"Bull crap, pissant, PD cases at 700 bucks a shot."
00:35:24.873,00:35:27.918,Public defender work is some of the best experience there is.
00:35:27.918,00:35:31.337,"I just had a case, Chuck, with three clients."
00:35:31.337,00:35:34.883,"Uh, arraignment, voir dire, jury trial, the whole nine yards."
00:35:34.883,00:35:37.677,You know what I took home?
00:35:37.677,00:35:40.847,I might as well head down to skid row and sell plasma.
00:35:40.847,00:35:43.433,You're representing people who have nowhere else to turn.
00:35:43.433,00:35:44.977,Money is beside the point.
00:35:44.977,00:35:48.105,Money is not beside the point.
00:35:48.105,00:35:50.690,"I keep telling you, have patience."
00:35:50.690,00:35:53.068,There are no shortcuts.
00:35:50.690,00:35:55.112,Do good work and the clients-- The clients will come.
00:35:55.112,00:35:56.947,Okay.
00:35:56.947,00:36:03.328,"Hand to God, I wasn't gonna say this, but you are broke."
00:36:03.328,00:36:05.288,I can't carry both of us.
00:36:05.288,00:36:08.541,"I've been trying like hell, but I can't."
00:36:10.293,00:36:13.546,"You're saying, what, you think you have to provide for me?"
00:36:13.546,00:36:16.299,I never asked you that.
00:36:16.299,00:36:20.261,"I've been doing my damnedest, but the day of reckoning is here."
00:36:20.261,00:36:27.060,"Soon, Chuck, you're gonna be out on the street with all the electromagnetism in the world raining down on you."
00:36:27.060,00:36:31.731,"Now, please, please, picture that, then tell me that money is beside the point."
00:36:31.731,00:36:33.733,This is what has you all worked up?
00:36:33.733,00:36:35.110,Yeah.
00:36:35.110,00:36:38.446,"Jimmy, there's nothing to worry about."
00:36:38.446,00:36:41.491,Here.
00:36:41.491,00:36:43.660,A stipend. There's gonna be one every week.
00:36:43.660,00:36:47.288,Eight hundred and fifty seven dollars from Hamlin Hamlin McGill.
00:36:47.288,00:36:49.248,I'm gonna pay him back.
00:36:49.248,00:36:52.210,"I didn't wanna take anything, but Howard was very insistent."
00:36:52.210,00:36:54.046,And I'm gonna pay you back too.
00:36:54.046,00:36:58.675,Hamlin was here?
00:36:58.675,00:37:00.760,He put his cell phone in the mailbox?
00:37:00.760,00:37:02.137,He understands the situation.
00:37:02.137,00:37:03.847,He grounded himself?
00:37:03.847,00:37:10.770,"And the two of you agreed that since, as everybody knows, you're going back to work any day now, the firm should help you make ends meet?"
00:37:10.770,00:37:13.190,"That's correct, minus the sarcasm."
00:37:13.190,00:37:14.900,Hamlin's making you a chump.
00:37:14.900,00:37:17.152,I'm going to get better!
00:37:17.152,00:37:21.322,"I'm gonna go back to work, and I'm picking up where I left off."
00:37:44.345,00:37:46.848,Sorry.
00:37:46.848,00:37:48.850,"Sorry, Chuck."
00:37:54.272,00:38:00.486,"I understand that you're trying to look out for me, but you're missing the bigger picture."
00:38:01.487,00:38:03.949,I got it.
00:38:03.949,00:38:05.909,Speaking of which...
00:38:07.994,00:38:10.288,Howard brought this.
00:38:10.288,00:38:12.540,He's concerned.
00:38:12.540,00:38:14.751,"You have to admit, it could be confusing."
00:38:14.751,00:38:17.963,Hamlin Hamlin McGill.
00:38:17.963,00:38:21.883,"That's my name, I was born with it. I-- Still."
00:38:25.762,00:38:28.807,How about Vanguard Law?
00:38:28.807,00:38:36.231,"Or Gibraltar. Ple-- Wait, so I'm not supposed to use my name on Hamlin's say-so?"
00:38:36.231,00:38:37.941,"What's he gonna do, sue me?"
00:38:37.941,00:38:40.443,Nobody wants to create an adversarial situation.
00:38:40.443,00:38:45.907,I'm sure Howard would gladly pay the cost of new matchbooks and so on.
00:38:45.907,00:38:50.078,It's simply a matter of professional courtesy.
00:38:52.956,00:38:55.583,"Chuck, whose side are you on?"
00:38:56.835,00:38:59.963,There are no sides.
00:38:59.963,00:39:02.799,"But, Jimmy..."
00:39:04.301,00:39:07.304,Wouldn't you rather build your own identity?
00:39:07.304,00:39:11.016,Why ride on someone else's coattails?
00:39:23.695,00:39:26.114,"You wanna dance, Howard?"
00:39:27.615,00:39:29.909,Let's dance.
00:39:34.080,00:39:36.374,"MAN: Yeah, backside on it."
00:39:41.629,00:39:43.381,Go.
00:39:46.134,00:39:50.305,"You can get closer than that, you bitch. Come on."
00:39:50.305,00:39:51.931,"All right, here it comes."
00:39:52.849,00:39:55.560,There you go. Better.
00:39:57.478,00:39:58.730,How was that?
00:39:58.730,00:40:00.523,It's all right.
00:40:00.523,00:40:03.735,So tighter. Everything-- Tighter? What--? Tighter what?
00:40:03.735,00:40:06.445,"I don't know, just stand tighter. You know what I mean?"
00:40:06.445,00:40:08.323,I don't know what you mean.
00:40:08.323,00:40:11.409,"That's a-- We can call that a stylistic choice, I guess."
00:40:11.409,00:40:15.580,"Hey, fellas. We got business."
00:40:15.580,00:40:17.040,How did you find us?
00:40:17.040,00:40:21.211,"JIMMY: I know. Eerie, right?"
00:40:21.211,00:40:25.464,"Whoa, come on."
00:40:25.464,00:40:29.844,Could be the most profitable 30 seconds of your lives.
00:40:37.352,00:40:42.065,Let me tell you about a young guy.
00:40:42.065,00:40:45.568,"Actually, he's about your age."
00:40:45.568,00:40:52.367,"He lived a long way from here in a town called Cicero, Illinois."
00:40:52.367,00:40:56.454,"And in Cicero, he was the man."
00:40:56.454,00:41:01.626,"I mean, when he strolled down the street, all the corner boys would give him the high five."
00:41:01.626,00:41:09.217,All the finest babes would smile at him and hope that he would smile back.
00:41:09.217,00:41:18.059,"They called him Slippin' Jimmy, and everybody wanted to be his friend."
00:41:18.059,00:41:20.937,Slippin' Jimmy.
00:41:20.937,00:41:23.398,What the hell kind of name is that?
00:41:23.398,00:41:27.319,"Well, I'll tell you now."
00:41:27.319,00:41:32.365,"You guys, growing up out here in the Golden West, you don't know. Okay?"
00:41:32.365,00:41:35.994,I'm talking cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose.
00:41:35.994,00:41:39.998,I'm talking wind that'll cut through your jacket and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.
00:41:39.998,00:41:43.418,"In fact, most folks in Cicero were scared of winter."
00:41:43.418,00:41:46.087,But not Jimmy.
00:41:46.087,00:41:57.140,"Jimmy would wait around all summer, and when September finally rolled around, and he'd feel that first cold wind come sweeping off Lake Michigan, he knew it was coming."
00:41:57.140,00:42:00.059,Was it Christmas?
00:42:00.059,00:42:04.689,Better.
00:42:04.689,00:42:09.402,"As soon as it was cold enough, he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice."
00:42:09.402,00:42:12.238,"State Street was good, Michigan Avenue was better."
00:42:12.238,00:42:18.453,"He'd pick his spot, wait for it to get busy, then he'd walk out on the ice and boom."
00:42:18.453,00:42:23.082,He would biff it so hard people would come running from five blocks away.
00:42:23.082,00:42:24.876,"Yeah, but did he collect?"
00:42:24.876,00:42:27.670,Did he collect?
00:42:27.670,00:42:31.216,"One good fall, he'd clear 6, 8 grand."
00:42:31.216,00:42:34.802,That'd keep him in Old Milwaukee and Maui Waui right through Labor Day.
00:42:34.802,00:42:37.638,Eight grand?
00:42:37.638,00:42:40.683,"Now, see, I look at you guys, I see potential."
00:42:40.683,00:42:43.936,"The skateboard's a nice wrinkle, that makes it a year-round gig."
00:42:43.936,00:42:47.315,"Clearly, you know how to take a header. Right?"
00:42:47.315,00:42:52.737,"But I gotta ask you, your best day ever, how much did you clear?"
00:42:55.114,00:42:57.534,Six hundred and thirty.
00:42:59.202,00:43:02.205,Six hundred and thirty bucks?
00:43:02.205,00:43:04.457,Two.
00:43:05.791,00:43:07.710,"Even at your age, that's gotta hurt."
00:43:07.710,00:43:09.462,True that.
00:43:09.462,00:43:12.965,"All right. Well, I got a job for you."
00:43:12.965,00:43:14.633,How's 2 grand sound?
00:43:14.633,00:43:17.220,Two grand for one hit?
00:43:17.220,00:43:19.013,One hit.
00:43:19.013,00:43:22.141,Plus you get to learn from the best.
00:43:23.476,00:43:25.186,CAL: Nice boat.
00:43:25.186,00:43:28.064,"Discrete, like a stripper pole in a mosque."
00:43:28.064,00:43:29.441,Forget the boat.
00:43:29.441,00:43:31.650,Look at the car.
00:43:31.650,00:43:34.070,"I don't know, a station wagon?"
00:43:34.070,00:43:36.864,A 1988 Mercury Sable wagon.
00:43:36.864,00:43:39.492,"Remember it. Burn it into your brains, you got it?"
00:43:39.492,00:43:41.953,"It's a Mercury Sable wagon, sure."
00:43:41.953,00:43:44.663,JIMMY: Close your eyes.
00:43:44.663,00:43:45.998,Brown.
00:43:45.998,00:43:47.833,"No, it's medium sandalwood."
00:43:47.833,00:43:49.127,Keep your eyes closed.
00:43:49.127,00:43:50.503,How does the license plate start?
00:43:50.503,00:43:52.046,BOTH: Four.
00:43:52.046,00:43:54.673,JIMMY: Give those gentlemen a gold star.
00:43:54.673,00:43:56.759,Betsy Kettleman's her name.
00:43:56.759,00:44:04.100,Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50 she comes through here on her way to pick up her kids at Kit Carson Elementary.
00:44:04.100,00:44:06.644,"You need a place where she's gonna slow down, right?"
00:44:06.644,00:44:09.522,Yeah.
00:44:09.522,00:44:15.445,"She slows down, she hangs a right, you come shooting out of there and do what you did to me."
00:44:15.445,00:44:18.864,"You go ass over teakettle, you make it a blue-ribbon special."
00:44:18.864,00:44:22.410,"When she gets out of the car, you're suffering Saint Sebastian, right?"
00:44:22.410,00:44:24.078,You're the hammer.
00:44:24.078,00:44:26.456,"You get in her face, you scare the bejeezus out of her."
00:44:26.456,00:44:29.334,Give me your phone.
00:44:29.334,00:44:31.210,"It's kind of busy here, don't you think?"
00:44:31.210,00:44:33.296,Yeah. Witnesses are good.
00:44:33.296,00:44:35.047,"Witnesses are pressure, all right?"
00:44:35.047,00:44:41.346,"Now, once you've got her good and rattled, then you call for an ambulance, but really you're calling for me."
00:44:41.346,00:44:44.307,"I'm number one on your speed dial, next to your weed dealer."
00:44:44.307,00:44:46.476,"You call me, I hotfoot it over here."
00:44:46.476,00:44:48.436,I just happened to be driving by.
00:44:48.436,00:44:55.067,"I stop to see what the trouble is, and this is the important part, you don't know me."
00:44:55.067,00:44:56.861,Sure.
00:44:56.861,00:44:59.864,"Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight."
00:44:59.864,00:45:02.783,"You light into me, okay?"
00:45:02.783,00:45:07.872,"No touching, leave the hair alone, but otherwise, you know, open season."
00:45:07.872,00:45:10.124,"Yell, stomp, call me a douche bag."
00:45:10.124,00:45:17.798,"I'm gonna play it cool, give you back some of the razzmatazz, and once she's seen the fireworks, you fold like a lawn chair."
00:45:17.798,00:45:21.802,When do we get our money?
00:45:21.802,00:45:24.305,After.
00:45:24.305,00:45:25.890,You get paid when I get paid.
00:45:25.890,00:45:28.059,I'm the rising tide that raises all dinghies.
00:45:28.059,00:45:29.894,"Now, pop quiz."
00:45:29.894,00:45:32.355,Mercury Sable wagon.
00:45:32.355,00:45:34.399,"Okay, do you know me?"
00:45:34.399,00:45:37.527,Damn straight.
00:45:42.990,00:45:47.662,"JIMMY: Well, I'm just glad I happened to be passing by."
00:45:47.662,00:45:51.123,"Happy to be of help, Betsy."
00:45:51.123,00:45:54.252,"Ahem. Please, call me James."
00:45:54.252,00:45:56.504,"Oh, the kid will be fine."
00:45:56.504,00:45:59.257,He just got his bell rung a little. I'll handle that.
00:45:59.257,00:46:00.966,"Oh, no."
00:46:00.966,00:46:03.135,"Oh, no, no."
00:46:00.966,00:46:06.723,"I wouldn't think of, uh, taking your money for this, so..."
00:46:06.723,00:46:11.644,"The embezzlement case? Yes, I'd be happy to talk it over."
00:46:13.145,00:46:15.440,"Oh, shit."
00:46:24.490,00:46:26.909,Two-minute warning.
00:46:26.909,00:46:28.578,Got it.
00:47:31.766,00:47:33.726,"Oh, my God."
00:47:33.726,00:47:35.894,MAN: What happened?
00:47:35.894,00:47:37.938,WOMAN: Call 911.
00:47:37.938,00:47:40.191,"LARS: Oh, my God. Cal. Cal."
00:47:40.191,00:47:42.859,Look at me. Are you okay?
00:47:42.859,00:47:44.945,"Cal, look at me."
00:47:44.945,00:47:48.032,What is she doing in there?
00:47:48.032,00:47:50.451,Where's her sense of responsibility?
00:47:50.451,00:47:53.579,What?
00:47:53.579,00:47:55.289,Hey! What the..?
00:47:55.289,00:47:57.082,"Funny to run into you, Betsy."
00:47:57.082,00:48:01.086,"I was just, uh, strolling the neighborhood."
00:48:01.086,00:48:05.257,You were in an accident?
00:48:12.181,00:48:14.684,Come on.
00:48:22.734,00:48:25.110,Yeah.
00:48:25.110,00:48:26.945,She what?
00:48:26.945,00:48:29.407,We were diamonds.
00:48:29.407,00:48:31.242,"Okay, wait. She hit and run?"
00:48:31.242,00:48:33.661,That's what I'm saying.
00:48:33.661,00:48:35.747,"Okay, just stay where you are."
00:48:37.373,00:48:39.417,"No, no, no. Screw that, man."
00:48:39.417,00:48:41.836,JIMMY: You're-- How are--?
00:48:41.836,00:48:43.504,"LARS: We got our ways, yo."
00:48:43.504,00:48:45.590,"JIMMY: Okay, okay, okay."
00:48:45.590,00:48:47.508,You do know me.
00:48:47.508,00:48:49.134,I'll meet you at the school.
00:48:49.134,00:48:50.845,"No, she's way past the school."
00:48:50.845,00:48:54.265,"She hooked a left on Juan Tabo, now she's coming into Holiday Park."
00:48:54.265,00:48:56.893,"Okay, stay with her."
00:48:54.265,00:48:58.811,"When she gets where she's going, wherever that is, don't do anything."
00:48:58.811,00:49:00.855,Wait for me.
00:49:00.855,00:49:03.441,"You haven't been right even once. Slippin' Jimmy, my ass."
00:49:03.441,00:49:05.276,"You fell into the honeypot, kid."
00:49:05.276,00:49:07.737,You get it?
00:49:07.737,00:49:11.616,So what?
00:49:11.616,00:49:13.618,He says we fell in the honeypot.
00:49:13.618,00:49:16.579,He says more money.
00:49:21.958,00:49:26.297,"Cal, Lars, whoever-- Oh, damn it."
00:49:26.297,00:49:28.591,"Come on, come on."
00:49:29.966,00:49:31.928,"Do it, do it, do it."
00:49:31.928,00:49:34.305,Son of a bitch.

00:50:30.695,00:50:32.237,I did that.
00:50:32.237,00:50:34.949,CAL: You did that to me.
00:50:34.949,00:50:36.826,CAL: Make with the dinero.

00:50:46.794,00:50:49.045,"Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Okay."
00:50:49.045,00:50:50.673,Let's go.
00:50:51.841,00:50:53.926,CAL: Is that money?
00:50:53.926,00:50:56.679,Watch the step.
00:50:56.679,00:50:59.097,Watch it. Watch the step.
00:51:09.859,00:51:12.028,Where are you?
00:51:12.028,00:51:13.946,Holiday Park.
00:51:13.946,00:51:17.408,"Mrs. Kettleman, Betsy, what are you doing here?"
00:51:17.408,00:51:19.994,Hit-and-run?
00:51:19.994,00:51:23.622,I can mediate.
00:51:23.622,00:51:26.082,"Come on, come on."
00:52:06.582,00:52:08.626,"Open up, officer of the court."
00:52:08.626,00:52:11.336,Open up in the name of the law.
00:52:13.464,00:00:34.618,"Good afternoon, this-- Mijo! Mijo, are you here?"
00:00:34.618,00:00:37.287,LARS: It's really messed up.
00:00:37.287,00:00:39.623,"ABUELITA: Mijo, I don't know what to do."
00:00:39.623,00:00:41.249,"These boys, these boys..."
00:00:41.249,00:00:45.086,"Hey, hello. Habla English."
00:00:45.086,00:00:46.421,Ow.
00:00:46.421,00:00:48.131,Grandson.
00:00:48.131,00:00:52.302,"Listen, I was driving, and suddenly there was a noise."
00:00:52.302,00:00:53.888,She hit him while driving.
00:00:53.888,00:00:55.305,My leg.
00:00:55.305,00:00:57.850,"Grandma, don't worry."
00:00:57.850,00:01:01.854,"Oh, my God!"
00:01:01.854,00:01:04.481,The crazy old biznatch ran over my brother.
00:01:04.481,00:01:08.360,It hurts so bad. It hurts so bad. It hurts so bad.
00:01:08.360,00:01:10.029,You see? He's hurt.
00:01:10.029,00:01:12.113,Look at that.
00:01:12.113,00:01:14.658,"She broke his leg, then she stood on the gas."
00:01:14.658,00:01:16.702,That's a hit-and-run.
00:01:16.702,00:01:18.662,That's a felony.
00:01:18.662,00:01:21.248,"Okay, hold on."
00:01:21.248,00:01:23.083,Start talking.
00:01:23.083,00:01:24.167,"Grandma, everything is okay."
00:01:24.167,00:01:25.920,What is happening?
00:01:25.920,00:01:28.422,Aah! I need to lean on you.
00:01:28.422,00:01:30.382,ABUELITA: I didn't mean to...
00:01:30.382,00:01:32.175,CAL: Es muy mal for my leg-o.
00:01:32.175,00:01:33.928,LARS: Lean on this.
00:01:33.928,00:01:38.015,CAL: It really hurts.
00:01:38.015,00:01:42.436,They say I'm in trouble.
00:01:42.436,00:01:44.772,CAL: Dude.
00:01:44.772,00:01:47.983,"LARS: Yes, sí, problema."
00:01:47.983,00:01:49.651,CAL: Aah!
00:01:49.651,00:01:51.653,Everything's all right.
00:01:51.653,00:01:53.864,"Turn it up so you can hear it, okay? Really loud."
00:01:53.864,00:01:55.950,"CAL: I don't know what you're saying, man."
00:01:55.950,00:01:59.286,Dude. Dude.
00:01:59.286,00:02:02.623,We got a real problem here.
00:02:08.211,00:02:10.965,"Hey, amigo, what're you gonna do about this leg situation?"
00:02:10.965,00:02:12.424,I really need a doctor.
00:02:12.424,00:02:14.718,"Doctors ain't cheap, yo."
00:02:14.718,00:02:18.513,"Either you or her, somebody's gotta pay."
00:02:18.513,00:02:19.807,You want money?
00:02:19.807,00:02:21.558,Yes.
00:02:21.558,00:02:25.520,Hit-and-run? It's no joke.
00:02:25.520,00:02:29.524,Cops? They coming?
00:02:31.026,00:02:33.070,"Yeah, maybe."
00:02:33.070,00:02:34.655,They could be looking at this tape.
00:02:34.655,00:02:36.698,It's all up to you.
00:02:40.619,00:02:44.915,You called her biznatch?
00:02:44.915,00:02:47.709,I didn't-- Whatever. Hurry. I'm hurting.
00:02:47.709,00:02:51.713,"Show us the green, or la policia is gonna come and take Granny away."
00:02:51.713,00:02:53.841,She's gonna go to jail.
00:02:53.841,00:02:55.509,That's right.
00:02:55.509,00:02:57.719,"Okay, good."
00:02:57.719,00:02:59.429,For what you did-- Unh!
00:03:02.016,00:03:04.183,Unh!
00:03:05.769,00:03:07.354,Biznatch.
00:04:35.483,00:04:37.360,What's happening?
00:04:37.360,00:04:39.863,Nothing. Everything's okay.
00:04:39.863,00:04:42.323,Are those men still here?
00:04:42.323,00:04:43.533,They're gone.
00:04:45.535,00:04:47.871,"I'm in trouble, right?"
00:04:47.871,00:04:49.623,"No, everything is all right."
00:04:49.623,00:04:53.001,They're not going to bother you again.
00:04:53.001,00:04:55.295,What's that on my carpet?
00:04:55.295,00:04:56.713,I spilled salsa.
00:04:58.673,00:05:00.592,Abuelita...
00:05:00.592,00:05:04.263,"No, no, no, I'm almost finished."
00:05:04.263,00:05:06.306,You're missing your show.
00:05:06.306,00:05:08.433,Oh...
00:05:08.433,00:05:11.019,Are you sure?
00:05:11.019,00:05:14.522,Let Mijo take care of it.
00:05:14.522,00:05:18.735,You're a very good boy.
00:05:18.735,00:05:22.072,"Listen, don't forget to use club soda."
00:05:22.072,00:05:24.658,"Yes, yes, don't worry."
00:05:42.968,00:05:45.887,"Hey, get over here."
00:05:45.887,00:05:48.182,"Yeah, my abuelita's."
00:05:48.182,00:05:51.852,"Bring No-Doze, and tell Nacho to bring his van."
00:06:23.925,00:06:27.637,"Open up, officer of the court."
00:06:30.349,00:06:41.276,"Good afternoon, this-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Showing hands."
00:06:41.276,00:06:44.654,"Um, non-threatening."
00:06:48.325,00:06:51.119,"You move, and you're dead."
00:06:52.329,00:06:53.788,Got it.
00:06:54.956,00:06:57.167,Seems to be a misunderstanding.
00:06:57.167,00:07:00.295,Is there by any chance a Betsy Kettleman here?
00:07:00.295,00:07:05.217,Not sure if this is a situation where I should or should not look you in the eye.
00:07:05.217,00:07:06.718,Now sit.
00:07:11.681,00:07:13.892,Who are you?
00:07:13.892,00:07:15.685,Are you with those red-headed scumbags?
00:07:15.685,00:07:18.397,My name's James McGill.
00:07:18.397,00:07:23.402,"Uh, I got a call from some clients, something about an accident."
00:07:23.402,00:07:25.904,I did not get any details.
00:07:25.904,00:07:31.826,"When I saw some skateboards in your front yard, I assumed-- ABUELITA: Mijo!"
00:07:31.826,00:07:37.332,"Mijo, who's this man?"
00:07:37.332,00:07:42.170,"No, no. He's as salesman."
00:07:42.170,00:07:44.339,Where are you going?
00:07:44.339,00:07:47.926,I'm going to grab the club soda.
00:07:47.926,00:07:53.765,"Mijo, I can still see the salsa you spilled."
00:07:53.765,00:07:56.226,You can't let it dry.
00:07:56.226,00:07:59.062,"Grandma, I will get the club soda, I swear."
00:07:59.062,00:08:02.023,"Trust me. Please, just go back upstairs."
00:08:02.023,00:08:06.236,Okay. But I don't want that to dry.
00:08:06.236,00:08:12.075,"Because once it dries, you can't get it out."
00:08:21.751,00:08:23.211,Talk.
00:08:23.211,00:08:27.757,I'm gonna make an educated guess what happened here.
00:08:27.757,00:08:32.720,"My two clients, Frick and Frack, the mopheads, were in a simple traffic accident."
00:08:32.720,00:08:34.139,A minor fender-bender.
00:08:34.139,00:08:37.851,"Maybe they were on the wrong side of the street, or they didn't look both ways."
00:08:37.851,00:08:40.687,It could happen to anyone. Heh.
00:08:40.687,00:08:47.235,"My clients, exhibiting extremely poor judgment, uh, followed your grandmother to this delightful, well-tended home."
00:08:49.196,00:08:58.705,"Now, at this juncture, I am deducing that they said or did something that crossed a line, and you, with some justification, you put them in their place."
00:09:00.540,00:09:04.878,"Based on the salsa stain there, could've gone a couple ways."
00:09:04.878,00:09:12.302,"The bottom line, not to be morbid, but if they're dead, um, I'm guessing that I'm, uh..."
00:09:14.846,00:09:19.559,"I'm gonna-- Yeah, I'm gonna go with glass half-full here and say they're not."
00:09:19.559,00:09:22.020,"My point is, if they're still alive, why kill us?"
00:09:22.020,00:09:24.398,Because of a misunderstanding?
00:09:24.398,00:09:27.650,"Why mess up your lovely abuelita's place? Ha, ha."
00:09:27.650,00:09:31.696,Why jump to the nuclear option?
00:09:31.696,00:09:36.868,"I will collect my moronic clients, and, poof, we are gone."
00:09:36.868,00:09:41.373,Neither you nor your lovely abuelita will ever lay eyes on us ever again.
00:09:41.373,00:09:45.168,Guaranteed.
00:09:47.421,00:09:51.174,"Assuming, you know, that they're still breathing."
00:09:58.557,00:10:00.725,Wow.
00:10:02.102,00:10:04.521,You got a mouth on you.
00:10:05.439,00:10:07.941,Thank you.
00:10:09.859,00:10:11.652,Get up.
00:10:16.408,00:10:18.785,That way.
00:10:18.785,00:10:21.662,"Yeah, yeah, sure."
00:10:37.678,00:10:41.891,"So I should, uh, cut them loose?"
00:10:51.610,00:10:53.153,Ow!
00:10:53.153,00:10:54.737,It was him!
00:10:54.737,00:10:57.240,"No, no, no!"
00:10:59.367,00:11:01.869,Say what?
00:11:01.869,00:11:05.206,He said we could clear 2 grand easy.
00:11:08.460,00:11:10.128,TUCO: You punking me?
00:11:19.179,00:11:22.307,Are you punking my abuelita?
00:11:22.307,00:11:25.560,He hit his head. He doesn't know what he's saying.
00:11:34.611,00:11:37.822,No.
00:11:37.822,00:11:40.241,For what are you getting 2 grand?
00:11:40.241,00:11:43.036,It was for going after your grandma.
00:11:43.036,00:11:45.997,"For taking a header over her car, and then for bracing her."
00:11:45.997,00:11:47.999,"It was him, I swear."
00:12:23.284,00:12:25.286,I can explain.
00:12:25.286,00:12:28.747,"You're gonna laugh, it's so-- I'm a lawyer. Check my ID, okay?"
00:12:28.747,00:12:31.000,I was running a scam-- On my abuelita?!
00:12:31.000,00:12:33.545,Not on your abuelita.
00:12:33.545,00:12:35.672,There's a woman named Betsy Kettleman.
00:12:35.672,00:12:40.051,"I mentioned her. She's married to Craig Kettleman, he's the treasurer of Bernalillo County."
00:12:40.051,00:12:41.636,I wanted his business.
00:12:41.636,00:12:43.804,He stole a million and a half bucks from the county.
00:12:43.804,00:12:47.308,He's gonna be indicted for embezzlement any day now.
00:12:47.308,00:12:48.685,That's a good case for me.
00:12:48.685,00:12:51.563,A lot of publicity.
00:12:51.563,00:12:59.279,"Anyway, I thought if I had these two run their little skateboard hustle on Mrs. Kettleman, I could, you know, rescue her."
00:12:59.279,00:13:04.576,"Come in, throw some oil on troubled waters, and get their business."
00:13:04.576,00:13:10.831,"But it turns out your lovely abuelita, she drives a car that's a whole lot like the Kettle-mobile."
00:13:10.831,00:13:15.587,So these two geniuses ran their little stunt on the wrong one.
00:13:15.587,00:13:18.298,"So joke's on me. Ha, ha."
00:13:18.298,00:13:20.300,Simple as that.
00:13:27.474,00:13:28.849,Where's he going?
00:13:28.849,00:13:30.602,What--?
00:13:30.602,00:13:31.936,"Talk to me, okay?"
00:13:33.229,00:13:37.317,Who do you think I am?
00:13:39.319,00:13:40.779,I was running a scam to get a client.
00:13:40.779,00:13:42.989,"I made a mistake, that's all this is."
00:13:42.989,00:13:44.949,"Oh, jeez."
00:13:46.284,00:13:53.124,"You don't need-- That's not-- I'll talk, okay?"
00:13:53.124,00:13:55.752,Tell me what you want to know.
00:13:56.877,00:13:59.297,Who do you think I am?
00:13:59.297,00:14:00.839,"Hey, use your words, okay?"
00:14:02.759,00:14:05.136,You know what I smell?
00:14:05.136,00:14:06.971,I smell lies.
00:14:08.556,00:14:12.435,I smell pork.
00:14:12.435,00:14:15.647,TUCO: We know you're with the heat.
00:14:15.647,00:14:18.857,"Local, FBI, DEA?!"
00:14:18.857,00:14:21.736,Just reach in my pocket right now. Right there.
00:14:29.452,00:14:31.287,Truth.
00:14:33.873,00:14:35.458,That is the truth!
00:14:35.458,00:14:38.294,I'm a lawyer! I passed the bar!
00:14:38.294,00:14:42.423,Not contract law-- I'm down at the courts every day.
00:14:42.423,00:14:45.844,People know me.
00:14:47.846,00:14:52.058,"I'm-- I'm Special Agent Jeffrey Steele, FBI."
00:14:52.058,00:14:53.934,FBI?
00:14:53.934,00:14:55.311,"I'm undercover, okay?"
00:14:55.311,00:14:57.104,You got me.
00:14:57.104,00:15:00.525,Releasing me would be the smart move.
00:15:00.525,00:15:01.984,You hear that shit?
00:15:01.984,00:15:06.489,I told you the business was too good.
00:15:06.489,00:15:09.367,I knew it.
00:15:09.367,00:15:11.160,Can I?
00:15:14.372,00:15:18.959,"Okay, uh, Special Agent, uh, Steele?"
00:15:18.959,00:15:20.336,Jeffrey A. Steele.
00:15:20.336,00:15:23.130,"Okay, Agent Steele, what business are we in?"
00:15:23.130,00:15:25.884,Business?
00:15:25.884,00:15:28.845,For what? What did we do?
00:15:28.845,00:15:30.430,What do we sell?
00:15:30.430,00:15:31.972,Drugs.
00:15:31.972,00:15:34.559,Uh...
00:15:34.559,00:15:38.688,"It's Title 21, Schedule II through Schedule V, including Part B."
00:15:38.688,00:15:42.024,That's what we call them down at the Bureau.
00:15:42.024,00:15:47.029,The task force is designated Operation Kingbreaker-- Kingbreaker?
00:15:47.029,00:15:50.784,That makes me the king!
00:15:50.784,00:15:52.452,Can I?
00:15:56.748,00:15:58.291,All right.
00:16:00.293,00:16:04.464,The next words out of your mouth ought to be the truth.
00:16:04.464,00:16:06.382,You understand?
00:16:06.382,00:16:08.426,Uh-huh.
00:16:08.426,00:16:10.094,Who are you?
00:16:16.100,00:16:19.019,"I'm James Morgan McGill, a lawyer trolling for business."
00:16:19.019,00:16:20.313,That's the truth.
00:16:20.313,00:16:21.856,"Now, you find a Bible, I'll swear on it."
00:16:21.856,00:16:24.358,"What about, uh, Operation Kingbreaker?"
00:16:24.358,00:16:26.778,"I made it up, okay?"
00:16:26.778,00:16:29.697,I don't know you.
00:16:29.697,00:16:32.450,"Uh, this was a mistake."
00:16:32.450,00:16:34.368,It's my mistake. Okay?
00:16:34.368,00:16:38.289,"I take full and complete responsibility, but..."
00:16:38.289,00:16:42.293,"I don't know any of your names, and I got a bad case of face blindness."
00:16:42.293,00:16:44.879,"You let us go, we're gonna forget this happened."
00:16:44.879,00:16:46.881,"Guys, we're gonna forget, right?"
00:16:46.881,00:16:49.509,Okay.
00:16:49.509,00:16:52.428,So if you'd just let us go...
00:16:52.428,00:16:56.683,I just-- We wanna just go home.
00:17:10.571,00:17:12.615,I say cut him loose.
00:17:13.741,00:17:17.411,He said he was FBI.
00:17:17.411,00:17:19.539,You had your wire cutters on him.
00:17:19.539,00:17:21.791,He would've said anything.
00:17:21.791,00:17:24.961,You really see the FBI hiring those two flaquitos?
00:17:26.796,00:17:29.507,Maybe.
00:17:31.551,00:17:35.596,Croaking a lawyer for no reason is bad business.
00:17:35.596,00:17:37.974,"He goes away, someone's gonna come look for him."
00:17:37.974,00:17:41.019,They walked into my house.
00:17:41.019,00:17:44.063,They disrespected my abuelita.
00:17:44.063,00:17:49.068,"They called her biznatch, and they just walk?!"
00:17:49.068,00:17:50.820,Uh-uh!
00:17:56.242,00:17:58.452,What about the lawyer?
00:18:00.788,00:18:03.332,He's giving respect.
00:18:05.793,00:18:07.294,Okay.
00:18:13.300,00:18:18.890,"James M. McGill, a lawyer you can trust."
00:18:22.852,00:18:25.021,"I know how to find you, James McGill."
00:18:25.021,00:18:28.816,Understand what I'm saying?
00:18:38.076,00:18:39.911,Up.
00:18:43.414,00:18:45.416,Okay?
00:18:46.709,00:18:50.170,Take him back to his car.
00:18:50.170,00:18:55.342,"Thank you. Uh, this is good."
00:18:55.342,00:18:56.677,NO-DOZE: Come on.
00:18:58.512,00:19:00.180,What-- What about them?
00:19:00.180,00:19:01.975,NO-DOZE: Come on.
00:19:01.975,00:19:05.311,NO-DOZE: Come on.
00:19:13.653,00:19:16.114,"NO-DOZE: Yo, where you going?"
00:19:16.114,00:19:18.116,NO-DOZE: Where you going?
00:19:18.116,00:19:20.910,Just let them go.
00:19:20.910,00:19:23.871,They don't deserve to die.
00:19:23.871,00:19:26.582,"I don't deserve to die, but they don't either."
00:19:26.582,00:19:29.418,I'm gonna skin them like javelinas!
00:19:29.418,00:19:32.421,Forget about them!
00:19:32.421,00:19:34.924,"Hey, think about their mother."
00:19:37.343,00:19:39.553,I spit on their mama!
00:19:39.553,00:19:42.807,She is a sweet little lady.
00:19:42.807,00:19:52.025,"She works hard, all day, every day, just like her mother before her, from dawn till dusk, scrubbing the floors of rich people."
00:19:52.025,00:19:53.943,"She needs a cane to walk, you know."
00:19:53.943,00:19:57.989,"She's got arthritis, and still she works every day."
00:19:57.989,00:20:03.161,What? For herself?
00:20:03.161,00:20:05.245,"Her boys, they're apples of her eye."
00:20:05.245,00:20:07.581,You say they don't deserve her?
00:20:07.581,00:20:11.293,Maybe so.
00:20:11.293,00:20:16.549,"Now, you turn them inside out, I want you to think about what happens to her."
00:20:16.549,00:20:19.218,That's on them. They should've thought about that.
00:20:19.218,00:20:23.222,"When I was at your abuelita's place, you were gonna let them go."
00:20:23.222,00:20:26.392,"The way I see it, that's because you're tough, but you're fair."
00:20:26.392,00:20:28.019,You're all about justice.
00:20:28.019,00:20:31.898,That's what I'm saying.
00:20:31.898,00:20:33.315,Justice.
00:20:33.315,00:20:35.484,"These two shit-for-brains, these big-mouths?"
00:20:35.484,00:20:37.528,You already beat the living hell out of them.
00:20:37.528,00:20:40.447,You think they're ever gonna forget today? Never.
00:20:40.447,00:20:44.410,"Ten years from now, they're still gonna be crapping their Jockeys."
00:20:44.410,00:20:47.454,It's not enough.
00:20:47.454,00:20:49.415,Then let's talk proportionality.
00:20:49.415,00:20:52.292,They're guilty.
00:20:52.292,00:20:56.172,"Now you have to decide, what's the right sentence?"
00:20:57.840,00:21:02.344,Like a judge.
00:21:02.344,00:21:04.222,Ever hear of the Code of Hammurabi?
00:21:04.222,00:21:07.141,Let the punishment fit the crime? Eye for an eye?
00:21:07.141,00:21:09.476,Eye for an eye.
00:21:09.476,00:21:11.729,You want me to blind them.
00:21:11.729,00:21:16.192,All they did was trash-talk.
00:21:16.192,00:21:19.486,"Wait. See, I'm advising..."
00:21:19.486,00:21:23.657,that you make the punishment fit the crime.
00:21:23.657,00:21:26.326,Punishment fit the crime.
00:21:26.326,00:21:28.204,Colombian neckties.
00:21:28.204,00:21:33.542,"I cut their throats, and then I pull their lying tongues through the slits!"
00:21:33.542,00:21:34.794,Biznatch!
00:21:34.794,00:21:37.421,Or you could give them black eyes.
00:21:37.421,00:21:41.759,Black eyes? Ha-ha-ha.
00:21:41.759,00:21:42.885,"That one there, holmes?"
00:21:42.885,00:21:45.846,"He already got a black eye, fool."
00:21:51.936,00:21:55.522,Stop helping.
00:21:55.522,00:21:58.317,Or you could sprain their ankles.
00:21:58.317,00:22:00.527,Sprain?
00:22:00.527,00:22:02.822,That's how they run their scam.
00:22:02.822,00:22:06.909,"They can't skate, you hit them where they live."
00:22:06.909,00:22:09.829,"I ain't spraining nothing, bitch."
00:22:09.829,00:22:13.249,"I'm gonna break their arms, then I'm gonna break their legs."
00:22:13.249,00:22:15.960,Arms? When did we get onto arms?
00:22:15.960,00:22:17.962,I'm cutting their legs off.
00:22:17.962,00:22:22.008,"We could go that way, but we were talking about breaking."
00:22:22.008,00:22:23.759,We're heading in the wrong direction.
00:22:23.759,00:22:26.095,Okay.
00:22:27.930,00:22:30.599,Break their legs.
00:22:30.599,00:22:35.146,Two. They got two legs.
00:22:35.146,00:22:36.981,One leg each?
00:22:38.649,00:22:42.653,One leg each.
00:22:42.653,00:22:49.118,"Hey, look, they can't skateboard for six months, and they're scared of you forever."
00:22:49.118,00:22:52.997,"You show everybody that you are the man, but that you're fair."
00:22:52.997,00:22:54.623,That you're just.
00:23:05.092,00:23:07.845,One leg each.
00:23:12.975,00:23:15.686,"That's tough, but it's fair."
00:23:17.646,00:23:19.481,"All right, lay them out!"
00:23:19.481,00:23:22.151,It's hotter than shit out here!
00:23:30.368,00:23:33.871,Quit moving!
00:23:38.584,00:23:41.670,"Look! Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!"
00:23:41.670,00:23:44.965,"He said he had a broken leg, now he's got one for real."
00:23:44.965,00:23:48.969,"You, tell your mama you're sorry, bitch."
00:23:48.969,00:23:50.721,Other one.
00:23:50.721,00:23:53.057,"Hey, look, it's backwards."
00:23:57.270,00:24:01.857,Check it out. I'm gonna do this one real clean.
00:24:05.903,00:24:07.196,TUCO: Whoo!
00:24:09.115,00:24:11.867,"Walk home now, bitch!"
00:24:11.867,00:24:15.955,Shut up! Shut up!
00:24:37.101,00:24:41.397,Here you go. Here you go.
00:24:41.397,00:24:44.691,You are the worst lawyer!
00:24:44.691,00:24:49.447,"Hey, I just talked you down from a death sentence to six months' probation."
00:24:51.449,00:24:54.118,I'm the best lawyer ever.
00:24:55.493,00:24:58.456,"Oh! Oh, my God!"
00:26:49.942,00:26:53.028,Could you--?
00:26:53.028,00:26:55.989,I'll be right back.
00:27:21.098,00:27:23.350,Ground yourself?
00:27:29.356,00:27:32.151,"Jimmy, did you ground yourself?"
00:27:49.627,00:27:52.296,I don't think you grounded yourself.
00:27:57.176,00:27:59.637,Jesus.
00:27:59.637,00:28:02.640,"Jimmy, you didn't drive like this, did you?"
00:28:09.855,00:28:11.982,"Oh, no."
00:28:14.568,00:28:18.822,No. I knew it.
00:29:58.338,00:30:00.048,Chuck.
00:30:02.217,00:30:04.094,Coffee?
00:30:05.095,00:30:08.265,"Yeah, thanks."
00:30:08.265,00:30:09.891,You're gonna have to take it black.
00:30:09.891,00:30:11.810,Out of milk?
00:30:14.688,00:30:16.649,Oh. Sorry.
00:30:32.080,00:30:35.041,Why are you in that space blanket?
00:30:35.041,00:30:37.836,You brought your cell phone in here last night.
00:30:37.836,00:30:40.631,It was in your pants pocket.
00:30:40.631,00:30:42.090,Oh.
00:30:43.509,00:30:45.803,Sorry about that.
00:30:47.137,00:30:50.015,Where--?
00:30:50.015,00:30:52.309,Outside.
00:31:02.402,00:31:04.237,How did I get here?
00:31:04.237,00:31:07.907,"Your car's not outside, so I'm assuming taxi."
00:31:12.078,00:31:17.917,"Right, uh, the bartender wouldn't let me drive."
00:31:31.348,00:31:33.933,Why are you in that space blanket?
00:31:35.519,00:31:38.938,"I told you, you brought your cell phone into my house."
00:31:43.527,00:31:48.281,"Chuck, uh, did you...?"
00:31:48.281,00:31:49.825,"Chuck, did you read this?"
00:31:49.825,00:31:52.952,Read what?
00:31:52.952,00:31:57.040,"Uh, this bill, did you read it?"
00:31:57.040,00:31:59.167,Emergency room bill.
00:31:59.167,00:32:03.046,I may have glanced at it.
00:32:05.298,00:32:08.802,"Hey, Chuck, listen."
00:32:08.802,00:32:12.890,"I'm down to my last dime, and suddenly I'm paying for broken legs."
00:32:12.890,00:32:17.895,"But it's not that, I swear."
00:32:19.479,00:32:24.234,"This represents a good thing, ultimately."
00:32:24.234,00:32:26.152,Okay.
00:32:26.152,00:32:29.573,I'm not backsliding.
00:32:29.573,00:32:31.157,Fine.
00:32:35.120,00:32:38.415,"Take off the space blanket, will you, please, Chuck?"
00:32:38.415,00:32:41.042,It helps.
00:32:41.042,00:32:43.712,Take off the space blanket.
00:32:43.712,00:32:47.800,It has nothing to do with that.
00:32:50.886,00:32:53.764,Take off the space blanket.
00:32:55.265,00:32:57.476,Why?
00:33:01.062,00:33:03.899,"Take off the space blanket, Chuck."
00:33:03.899,00:33:05.901,Come on.
00:33:05.901,00:33:07.527,Take off the blanket.
00:33:19.498,00:33:20.999,Thank you.
00:33:26.964,00:33:29.800,Front yard?

00:34:24.646,00:34:26.272,What do you want?
00:34:26.272,00:34:29.860,Not to starve to death.
00:34:31.152,00:34:32.445,What do you say?
00:34:33.739,00:34:36.449,You got something for me?
00:34:57.721,00:35:00.265,"It's showtime, folks."
00:35:14.780,00:35:17.156,"GUARD: Clovis, lawyer."
00:35:17.156,00:35:18.784,I'm gonna kill him.

00:35:21.119,00:35:23.038,Say what?
00:35:23.038,00:35:25.958,"Your Honor, I'm very sorry, and I'll never do it again."
00:35:25.958,00:35:29.669,"Okay, Mr. Pearson."
00:35:29.669,00:35:31.088,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:35:32.547,00:35:35.592,"I told you a suit, remember?"
00:35:35.592,00:35:38.344,"That's a loaner, okay?"
00:35:38.344,00:35:40.305,Petty with a prior.
00:35:40.305,00:35:42.474,Petty with a prior.
00:35:42.474,00:35:44.392,There's no food in the house.
00:35:44.392,00:35:46.061,Petty with a prior.
00:35:55.570,00:35:57.530,You're light on stickers.
00:35:57.530,00:35:59.324,Five dollars.
00:35:59.324,00:36:01.076,"You got four, you need five."
00:36:01.076,00:36:02.911,There's four 90-minute stickers.
00:36:02.911,00:36:05.122,You've been here six hours and five minutes.
00:36:05.122,00:36:07.082,It takes ten minutes to walk down here.
00:36:07.082,00:36:10.836,"Five dollars, or you go get another sticker."
00:36:12.087,00:36:14.840,"This makes you feel real important, huh?"
00:36:14.840,00:36:17.425,Not enough stickers?
00:36:23.348,00:36:25.183,"It's showtime, folks."
00:36:28.436,00:36:30.480,It's showtime.
00:36:55.172,00:36:56.464,Petty with a prior.
00:36:56.464,00:36:58.591,Prior will stay on his sheet for life.
00:36:58.591,00:37:01.344,Petty with a prior.
00:37:01.344,00:37:04.472,You're overcharging him.
00:37:06.933,00:37:09.853,That lady up there?
00:37:09.853,00:37:14.399,"This is not a me problem, this is a you problem."
00:37:17.443,00:37:20.197,It's showtime.
00:37:22.448,00:37:23.825,It's from a movie.

00:37:50.227,00:37:51.853,I plead the kid to the sheet.
00:37:51.853,00:37:53.188,You give me a continued sentence.
00:37:53.188,00:37:55.148,He gets six months.
00:37:53.188,00:37:56.566,"If he's still clean, you file for a dismissal."
00:37:56.566,00:38:00.028,Come on. This is how you want to spend your time?
00:38:00.028,00:38:01.529,You can have the rest of these.
00:38:13.875,00:38:15.877,"GUARD: Berger, lawyer."

00:38:20.590,00:38:22.842,I'm James McGill.
00:38:22.842,00:38:25.470,Doesn't matter.
00:38:25.470,00:38:28.723,"Well, do you know anybody who looks like her?"
00:38:28.723,00:38:30.642,"No, an uncle won't do it."
00:38:30.642,00:38:35.147,"Okay, so a fire was started."
00:38:35.147,00:38:37.816,"Freezing, shivering, as she is now."
00:38:37.816,00:38:40.652,"In fact, wrote a book about it."
00:38:41.444,00:38:43.488,To make some cookies.
00:38:43.488,00:38:52.205,But because you-- Given her this name-- You can see that this man-- Chose-- A bonehead move.
00:39:09.055,00:39:11.390,You're like a troll under a bridge.
00:39:11.390,00:39:14.560,"You must have the stickers, or you won't pass."
00:39:14.560,00:39:17.105,Troll alert here. Don't feed it.
00:39:30.576,00:39:32.078,"Chào cô, ladies."
00:39:33.663,00:39:35.040,"Good evening, Ms. Nguyen."
00:39:35.040,00:39:38.918,No mail.
00:40:14.913,00:40:19.292,FEMALE VOICE: You have zero messages.
00:41:23.064,00:41:24.565,Customer.
00:41:24.565,00:41:26.359,"For you, a customer."
00:41:26.359,00:41:29.612,"Uh, sure, sure."
00:41:55.221,00:41:57.556,"Welcome, welcome."
00:41:57.556,00:42:02.103,"Excuse the temporary, uh, quarters."
00:42:02.103,00:42:04.105,Wow.
00:42:04.105,00:42:06.191,Cozy.
00:42:08.318,00:42:09.610,Just me.
00:42:10.862,00:42:13.072,"Tuco freaked you out, huh?"
00:42:14.573,00:42:18.661,It's cool.
00:42:32.758,00:42:35.220,"So, uh..."
00:42:35.220,00:42:37.514,what can I do for you?
00:42:39.474,00:42:43.478,I've been thinking about what you said out there in the desert.
00:42:43.478,00:42:47.065,"Those people that you were trying to scam, how much did they steal?"
00:42:47.065,00:42:49.067,Um...
00:42:52.737,00:42:59.244,So they have a million and a half bucks somewhere.
00:42:59.244,00:43:00.495,"In what, cash?"
00:43:00.495,00:43:05.333,I don't-- Why are you asking me?
00:43:05.333,00:43:07.793,I'm gonna rip them off.
00:43:07.793,00:43:09.837,Oh.
00:43:09.837,00:43:12.757,"I like ripping off thieves, because they can't go to the cops."
00:43:12.757,00:43:14.259,They have no recourse.
00:43:14.259,00:43:16.010,Hmm.
00:43:16.010,00:43:22.392,"You point me at where they have their cash, I'll pay you-- Uh, what do you call it? --a finder's fee."
00:43:22.392,00:43:25.728,"Call it 10 percent, 100 large."
00:43:28.231,00:43:29.941,Wha--?
00:43:29.941,00:43:32.360,Why would you come to me for that?
00:43:34.028,00:43:35.572,You already tried ripping them off.
00:43:35.572,00:43:38.032,I'm gonna finish what you started.
00:43:38.032,00:43:41.702,I wasn't trying to rip them off.
00:43:41.702,00:43:42.995,Okay.
00:43:45.039,00:43:47.125,I don't know where their money is.
00:43:47.125,00:43:49.252,Smart guy like you can figure it out.
00:43:49.252,00:43:52.171,"Find out what I need to know, nobody gets hurt."
00:43:52.171,00:43:54.549,"We rip them off, easy money."
00:43:54.549,00:43:58.428,"Look, I'm a lawyer, not a criminal."
00:44:02.848,00:44:04.350,You are shitting me.
00:44:04.350,00:44:06.394,I crossed a line.
00:44:06.394,00:44:07.770,I made a mistake.
00:44:07.770,00:44:09.897,I'm not doing that again.
00:44:09.897,00:44:14.569,I got between you and Tuco.
00:44:14.569,00:44:16.529,"Think you'd be here now, I kept my mouth shut?"
00:44:16.529,00:44:20.783,And I appreciate that.
00:44:20.783,00:44:28.958,"And if you're ever in trouble, God forbid, legal trouble, I will be there 24/7 as a lawyer."
00:44:35.047,00:44:39.010,And I'm not saying anything about this to anybody.
00:44:39.010,00:44:46.976,"As far as I'm concerned, you're a client, this is a consultation, and everything you just told me is privileged."
00:44:46.976,00:44:49.521,"You rat, you die."
00:44:49.521,00:44:52.773,And that too.
00:45:15.254,00:45:17.590,For when you figure out you're in the game.
00:45:17.590,00:45:21.678,"I'm not in the game, I-- I promise."
00:00:23.774,00:00:25.734,Wallenda here.
00:00:25.734,00:00:27.820,Yeah.
00:00:31.072,00:00:33.241,Name?
00:00:33.241,00:00:35.452,Client visit.
00:01:02.521,00:01:04.523,Here's Johnny.
00:01:04.523,00:01:07.192,"Heh, heh."
00:01:07.192,00:01:09.277,All right.
00:01:09.277,00:01:11.405,You're looking good.
00:01:11.405,00:01:12.990,Sorry you had to come all this way.
00:01:12.990,00:01:15.492,"It's a long way, right?"
00:01:15.492,00:01:17.036,Yeah. Sorry.
00:01:17.036,00:01:25.794,"Only two things I know about Albuquerque: Bugs Bunny should've taken a left turn there, and give me a hundred tries, I'll never be able to spell it."
00:01:28.422,00:01:30.131,Anyway...
00:01:30.131,00:01:34.386,"Uh, as you can see, I'm in a-- A bit of a pickle."
00:01:34.386,00:01:35.763,You certainly are.
00:01:37.222,00:01:40.099,Forget the property damage and assault charges.
00:01:40.099,00:01:42.978,"You face being labeled a sex offender, Jimmy."
00:01:42.978,00:01:47.106,"If that happens, it'll follow you for the rest of your life."
00:01:47.106,00:01:48.817,Okay?
00:01:48.817,00:01:52.362,"That is a trumped-up load of horse crap, Chuck. Come on."
00:01:52.362,00:01:54.907,Is that what I tell the judge?
00:01:54.907,00:01:56.533,I'm not the lawyer here.
00:01:56.533,00:01:58.911,It was a Chicago sunroof.
00:01:58.911,00:02:00.746,That's not even remotely a...
00:02:03.916,00:02:06.251,"Let's talk strategy, okay?"
00:02:06.251,00:02:10.756,Because I need you to work your magic and make this whole situation go poof.
00:02:10.756,00:02:13.926,You got a plan of attack? Huh?
00:02:13.926,00:02:19.473,"Come on, I know I haven't made it easy for you, but you are-- You are the man."
00:02:21.266,00:02:27.689,"Right? I know you've got a million legal loopholes that we can dance through, big bag of tricks."
00:02:27.689,00:02:31.652,"You know, any clever technicalities, huh?"
00:02:31.652,00:02:36.657,Reasonable-doubt-type stuff?
00:02:36.657,00:02:40.535,"I haven't seen you in, what, five years?"
00:02:40.535,00:02:42.370,We barely hear from you.
00:02:42.370,00:02:46.667,"Now that you're in it up to your neck, you can't even call me yourself."
00:02:46.667,00:02:49.086,Mom took it upon herself to call.
00:02:49.086,00:02:50.921,I was letting her know where I was.
00:02:50.921,00:02:52.547,You didn't cry to her on the phone?
00:02:52.547,00:02:53.924,What? No.
00:02:53.924,00:02:55.968,You didn't cry and beg Mom for help?
00:02:55.968,00:03:00.430,"Wha--? Jesus. She hears what she wants to hear, okay?"
00:03:00.430,00:03:05.310,I'm gonna cry on a payphone in the middle of Cook County Jail. Jesus.
00:03:06.687,00:03:10.774,"Can we--? Can we talk strategy here, huh?"
00:03:12.151,00:03:17.823,Look-- I know I'm a lousy brother.
00:03:19.616,00:03:22.536,"I'm a lousy brother, I'm a big screw-up."
00:03:22.536,00:03:32.253,"And if I was just a better person, I would not only stop letting you down-- You know what?"
00:03:32.253,00:03:38.426,And it's about time that I started to make both of us proud.
00:03:38.426,00:03:40.679,Am I right?
00:03:40.679,00:03:43.098,"Wait. Chuck, wait, wait, wait."
00:03:43.098,00:03:44.766,"No, no, you can't leave me, no."
00:03:44.766,00:03:48.020,"If I don't get out of this, my life is over."
00:03:50.189,00:03:53.400,So long as you understand that.
00:03:53.400,00:03:54.693,Yeah.
00:03:54.693,00:04:00.407,"Jimmy, if I do this-- If."
00:04:00.407,00:04:03.618,--do not make a fool out of me.
00:04:05.204,00:04:06.705,I promise I won't.
00:04:06.705,00:04:12.920,"Everything you're doing, everything you're involved with, that's over."
00:04:12.920,00:04:15.463,Just tell me what to do.
00:04:15.463,00:04:18.759,"Whatever it is, I'll do it."
00:04:18.759,00:04:21.970,Just say it.
00:04:21.970,00:04:24.347,"Please, Chuck?"
00:04:24.347,00:04:26.433,Help me.
00:05:59.067,00:06:00.443,Hello?
00:06:00.443,00:06:02.529,"Hey, it's me."
00:06:06.074,00:06:09.494,Unh. Jimmy?
00:06:09.494,00:06:10.871,"Jesus, what time is it?"
00:06:10.871,00:06:15.292,"Clock says 2, but I think that might be Ho Chi Minh's time zone."
00:06:15.292,00:06:18.170,What? What's happening?
00:06:18.170,00:06:22.049,"Yeah, Chuck..."
00:06:22.049,00:06:25.510,Everything's all right. Ahem.
00:06:25.510,00:06:27.888,"So, uh..."
00:06:27.888,00:06:30.057,Hey. What you doing?
00:06:30.057,00:06:32.351,Jimmy...
00:06:32.351,00:06:34.644,No. I'm not talking dirty to you.
00:06:34.644,00:06:38.773,What? You think that's the only reason I would call you at this time of night?
00:06:38.773,00:06:40.234,"I mean, can we just--?"
00:06:40.234,00:06:42.527,"Give me a little bit of credit, okay?"
00:06:42.527,00:06:44.445,And you're not talking dirty to me either.
00:06:44.445,00:06:45.613,"Okay, bye."
00:06:45.613,00:06:47.324,I knew it.
00:06:47.324,00:06:49.784,"Just joking, having fun with you."
00:06:49.784,00:06:54.831,"I am calling you tonight with quality, PG phone conversation."
00:06:54.831,00:06:57.876,PG-13 at worst.
00:06:57.876,00:07:00.128,Hand to God. You know?
00:07:00.128,00:07:09.470,"But, uh, if you hang up now and drive straight over, limited time only, I'm offering a free pedicure and foot bath."
00:07:09.470,00:07:11.765,Is that right? Wow.
00:07:11.765,00:07:13.308,Maybe next time.
00:07:13.308,00:07:16.603,Hey. More for me. Ahem.
00:07:18.146,00:07:26.196,"Uh, you're, uh, probably swamped with work anyways, what with that big, fat giant case falling right into your lap."
00:07:26.196,00:07:27.572,Which case is that?
00:07:27.572,00:07:29.241,"I don't know. Some, uh..."
00:07:29.241,00:07:31.910,Some county official or something?
00:07:31.910,00:07:33.745,It was in all the papers.
00:07:33.745,00:07:36.623,Craig Kettleman.
00:07:36.623,00:07:40.835,Yeah. The primo client your dipwad boss stole right out from under me.
00:07:40.835,00:07:42.629,Nobody stole anybody.
00:07:42.629,00:07:44.464,The Kettlemans made a choice.
00:07:44.464,00:07:46.758,"So did the Donner party, when they took that shortcut."
00:07:46.758,00:07:49.510,Come on.
00:07:49.510,00:07:53.848,"And I'm gonna be second chair if it ever goes to trial, so..."
00:07:53.848,00:07:55.809,be happy for me.
00:07:55.809,00:08:01.481,"Hey, uh, how much exactly did Kettleman get away with?"
00:08:01.481,00:08:05.235,"Mm, excuse me."
00:08:05.235,00:08:08.363,"Uh, excuse me, but I'm a taxpayer in this county."
00:08:08.363,00:08:10.115,I think I have a right to know.
00:08:10.115,00:08:13.827,"And besides, it's not like I'm his lawyer or anything."
00:08:13.827,00:08:16.496,I have to go to sleep.
00:08:16.496,00:08:18.498,So do you. I know you have court in the morning.
00:08:18.498,00:08:22.043,"He got away with a million, million six, at least?"
00:08:22.043,00:08:25.130,I'm not talking details of a case with you. Good night.
00:08:25.130,00:08:26.881,Where did he stash all that dough?
00:08:26.881,00:08:28.800,Besides for buying that idiotic boat.
00:08:28.800,00:08:30.760,Hello? Guilty.
00:08:30.760,00:08:33.180,Hanging up now.
00:08:33.180,00:08:35.807,"You know, he's probably a target."
00:08:35.807,00:08:39.936,"Somebody might get some bad, bad ideas."
00:08:39.936,00:08:46.026,"You know, if Kettleman isn't careful with that money, I mean, his whole family could be in danger."
00:08:46.026,00:08:47.652,"What do you mean, danger?"
00:08:49.529,00:08:53.616,"Jimmy, why would you say that?"
00:08:53.616,00:08:58.455,You said the family might be in danger.
00:08:58.455,00:09:00.374,I did? I...
00:09:00.374,00:09:03.877,I... Ahem.
00:09:03.877,00:09:06.629,"So I'm just, uh..."
00:09:06.629,00:09:10.425,I'm thinking out loud.
00:09:10.425,00:09:12.093,I'm spinning thoughts.
00:09:12.093,00:09:14.179,You sure?
00:09:14.179,00:09:17.598,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh..."
00:09:17.598,00:09:23.271,So I will see you down in the court bowels mañana.
00:09:23.271,00:09:25.065,"Good night, Kim."
00:09:25.065,00:09:26.900,"Good night, Jimmy."
00:09:37.160,00:09:39.287,I'm no hero.
00:11:25.268,00:11:28.855,Hello! You've reached Team Kettleman!
00:11:28.855,00:11:35.862,CRAIG: Leave a message for Craig-- BETSY: Betsy-- WARREN: Warren-- JO JO: And Jo Jo-- ALL: --after the beep!

00:12:21.282,00:12:25.412,"Kettlemans, you're in danger."
00:12:25.412,00:12:27.038,"I'm sorry, what?"
00:12:27.038,00:12:29.290,"Craig, who is it?"
00:12:29.290,00:12:31.792,"Wait, say--?"
00:12:31.792,00:12:34.713,They know about your money.
00:12:34.713,00:12:36.631,"Yeah, what are you trying to say?"
00:12:39.676,00:12:41.720,This is a warning.
00:12:41.720,00:12:43.722,They're coming for your money.
00:12:47.308,00:12:49.394,The money.
00:12:49.394,00:12:51.187,You have a terrible connection.
00:12:51.187,00:12:54.023,I'm warning you.
00:12:54.023,00:12:55.483,Be careful.
00:12:55.483,00:12:57.235,Can you call back on a better line?
00:12:57.235,00:12:59.446,"Kettlemans, you're in danger."
00:12:59.446,00:13:01.448,They're coming for your money.
00:13:12.875,00:13:14.753,CRAIG: What did he say?
00:13:14.753,00:13:17.505,We're-- In danger.
00:13:17.505,00:13:19.466,They're coming.
00:13:19.466,00:13:20.759,Who--?
00:13:21.968,00:13:23.595,Who's coming?
00:13:59.922,00:14:02.717,"Okay, how about this?"
00:14:02.717,00:14:04.636,MAN: Can't do it.
00:14:04.636,00:14:07.221,MAN: Can't do it.
00:14:07.221,00:14:10.224,Would you work with me here?
00:14:12.435,00:14:14.813,"What'd you eat for lunch, the whole roast beast?"
00:14:14.813,00:14:17.524,Funny.
00:14:17.524,00:14:18.817,Hear me out.
00:14:18.817,00:14:20.234,Wow.
00:14:20.234,00:14:24.238,"The 30 he's done, which is a 60 credit, plus 60 additional days."
00:14:24.238,00:14:27.200,Can't do it.
00:14:27.200,00:14:32.706,"Six months plus the time he's done, halftime for good behavior, out in 90, that's my final."
00:14:32.706,00:14:34.915,That's never gonna happen.
00:14:34.915,00:14:37.126,Come on.
00:14:37.126,00:14:39.920,"Now, that is the best deal you're gonna get."
00:14:39.920,00:14:41.339,I can't do it.
00:14:41.339,00:14:44.884,The guy drove drunk into a shopping center and killed three people.
00:14:44.884,00:14:47.887,Shopping center?
00:14:47.887,00:14:50.097,"Armed robbery, liquor store."
00:14:50.097,00:14:53.059,He assaulted a cashier with a bottle of Kahlúa.
00:14:54.227,00:14:56.730,"Oh, I was thinking Darryl Redwood."
00:14:56.730,00:14:59.399,"Yeah, okay, my bad."
00:14:59.399,00:15:01.693,"Okay, go. Start over."
00:15:01.693,00:15:03.110,I am not starting over.
00:15:03.110,00:15:08.491,"I'm busting my nut here for 700 a throw, inhaling your B.M."
00:15:05.112,00:15:11.786,"straight from Satan's bunghole, and you can't tell one defendant from another?"
00:15:11.786,00:15:15.456,Ninety days with good behavior.
00:15:15.456,00:15:16.999,Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
00:15:16.999,00:15:20.002,Say it. Say the words I accept the deal.
00:15:20.002,00:15:22.672,"Yeah, I accept-- I accept the deal."
00:15:34.267,00:15:35.935,Good morning.
00:15:38.229,00:15:40.565,"What do you mean, what did I mean?"
00:15:41.858,00:15:51.284,"No, I told you, I was drunk. I just-- Kim, why are you asking me this?"
00:15:53.077,00:15:55.705,"Oh, damn it. Here."
00:15:55.705,00:15:57.540,I didn't have time to get the validation.
00:15:57.540,00:15:59.709,Fine. Nine bucks.
00:16:03.254,00:16:06.299,I-- I don't have it.
00:16:08.426,00:16:11.220,"You know the drill, money or the validation."
00:16:11.220,00:16:12.847,"Look, this is an emergency, okay?"
00:16:12.847,00:16:15.892,"A serious, serious emergency."
00:16:15.892,00:16:20.438,"I promise, on the souls of my forefathers, I will get you the stickers when I come back."
00:16:20.438,00:16:23.942,I will get you extra if you just let me go.
00:16:26.068,00:16:32.575,"Fine. Fine. You're gonna make me walk back and get the stickers, I will walk back and get the stickers."
00:16:32.575,00:16:36.245,I'm not making you do anything.
00:16:36.245,00:16:38.832,"Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night."
00:16:44.086,00:16:46.005,"Screw you, geezer!"
00:17:09.570,00:17:12.406,"MAN 1: Oh, no, just want to make sure we check that back door."
00:17:14.033,00:17:15.869,"MAN 2: Copy that, dispatch."
00:17:19.998,00:17:23.668,"MAN 3: Okay, gentlemen, we're searching in a two block radius."
00:17:44.522,00:17:46.232,Jimmy.
00:17:46.232,00:17:47.775,What brought you here?
00:17:47.775,00:17:51.404,"Me? Uh, I was surfing the police scanner."
00:17:51.404,00:17:53.740,Heard there was big activity out this way.
00:17:53.740,00:17:55.366,There's no business for you.
00:17:55.366,00:17:57.368,Maybe next time.
00:17:57.368,00:18:00.914,"Uh, the Kettlemans okay?"
00:18:00.914,00:18:04.834,"Neighbor was walking the dog last night, saw the front door wide open."
00:18:04.834,00:18:06.794,"Place is ransacked, no sign of the family."
00:18:06.794,00:18:10.297,"There's no note, so we're still figuring it out."
00:18:10.297,00:18:12.425,I gotta get back.
00:18:12.425,00:18:15.887,"Yeah, yeah. Of course."
00:18:27.273,00:18:29.316,Why did you come here?
00:18:29.316,00:18:32.737,I'm supporting a friend in need.
00:18:32.737,00:18:34.530,Tell me why you said those things.
00:18:34.530,00:18:36.490,I'm reading tea leaves.
00:18:34.530,00:18:39.243,Same way I knew the Kettlemans needed a lawyer.
00:18:39.243,00:18:41.746,It's logical somebody would come after it.
00:18:41.746,00:18:45.124,"So the same night you worry about them, they disappear?"
00:18:45.124,00:18:47.627,"Yeah, it's crazy."
00:18:47.627,00:18:50.421,Jimmy. It's not just Craig and Betsy Kettleman.
00:18:50.421,00:18:52.924,It's their two kids as well.
00:18:52.924,00:18:57.095,"You would say something if you could help find them, right?"
00:18:59.097,00:19:01.557,I--I don't know what happened to them.
00:19:01.557,00:19:03.476,"Really, I don't know."
00:19:05.144,00:19:07.605,"The longer you stay, the more explaining I have to do."
00:19:07.605,00:19:09.565,I'll talk to you later.
00:19:09.565,00:19:13.027,You'll tell me if there's anything I can do?
00:19:33.047,00:19:36.509,It's gonna work out.
00:19:36.509,00:19:38.385,It's gonna be fine.
00:20:08.207,00:20:10.209,Nacho. Leave it.
00:20:10.209,00:20:26.767,"Uh... Yes, I'm, uh-- Ahem. This is the party you spoke to the other day, uh, and I sincerely want to help you de-escalate your situation legally and otherwise."
00:20:26.767,00:20:34.817,"Um, so call me at 146-8729 at your earliest convenience."
00:20:34.817,00:20:37.195,But soon. Please.
00:21:00.843,00:21:02.887,Nacho. Leave it.
00:21:02.887,00:21:06.182,"Yeah, Nacho. Hi. Uh..."
00:21:06.182,00:21:10.186,"Just to clarify. Look, I don't know anything. Uh..."
00:21:10.186,00:21:14.690,"I have spoken to no one, and there are no rats on this ship."
00:21:14.690,00:21:21.280,"But for the sake of everyone involved, I would just like to open a dialogue."
00:21:21.280,00:21:26.911,So 146-8729.
00:21:41.968,00:21:45.638,"If I didn't say it before, time is of the essence on this matter."
00:21:45.638,00:21:50.350,"So, uh, I'm gonna hang up now if you're trying to call."
00:21:50.350,00:21:54.438,"Uh, there's no call waiting here if you get a busy signal."
00:21:54.438,00:21:59.860,146-8729. Just keep trying.
00:22:01.320,00:22:05.491,"I can put out this fire, if there is a fire."
00:22:05.491,00:22:09.954,"By hope of hopes, this is all a big misunderstanding."
00:22:09.954,00:22:13.916,146-8729.
00:22:31.225,00:22:33.393,Hello?
00:22:33.393,00:22:36.063,Hello?
00:22:36.063,00:22:39.357,Nacho? Nacho.
00:23:52.265,00:23:55.309,Walking. Just walking.
00:23:55.309,00:23:58.396,Strolling along.
00:24:15.913,00:24:17.455,"Oh, thank God. Help. Help."
00:24:17.455,00:24:18.791,Down.
00:24:18.791,00:24:20.667,You guys are cops?
00:24:20.667,00:24:23.212,I've got bad knees!
00:24:23.212,00:24:25.547,"Officers, you're making a mistake."
00:24:25.547,00:24:27.674,"My name's McGill, James McGill."
00:24:27.674,00:24:29.009,I'm an attorney.
00:24:29.009,00:24:31.595,Easy. Easy.
00:24:33.264,00:24:36.558,It's his lawyer.
00:24:48.737,00:24:50.364,You sure he asked for me?
00:24:50.364,00:24:52.532,Going in or what?
00:25:01.375,00:25:03.877,Hey. Ahem.
00:25:05.171,00:25:08.506,"You asked for me, and I have come."
00:25:08.506,00:25:12.303,"I want to tell you, this was a wise move."
00:25:12.303,00:25:15.139,"Very smart, because I'm here to help."
00:25:15.139,00:25:19.018,"Everyone, all parties, but mostly you."
00:25:21.728,00:25:31.030,"Uh, those two detectives, they just gave me an earful, and what they were telling me is..."
00:25:31.030,00:25:33.824,It's problematic.
00:25:33.824,00:25:38.745,"I'm gonna pitch it back to you, so I know we're on the same page."
00:25:38.745,00:25:45.211,A neighbor lady saw a suspicious van parked across the street from the Kettlemans' house two nights in a row.
00:25:45.211,00:25:47.087,She wrote down the license plate.
00:25:47.087,00:25:49.756,It was your license plate.
00:25:49.756,00:25:57.056,"Cops tracked your van and you, searched it and found blood on the floor."
00:25:57.056,00:26:00.767,So here we are.
00:26:03.270,00:26:06.606,Um... Um...
00:26:06.606,00:26:12.446,"They're calling the FBI in on this, which makes it federal."
00:26:12.446,00:26:15.741,"That's a bad thing, Nacho."
00:26:15.741,00:26:30.297,"But if you tell me where the family is, if you give them up now, full cooperation, deep remorse, I feel very good about knocking your sentence down to the minimum, 18 years."
00:26:33.384,00:26:39.932,"They take this good behavior thing very seriously, so start here, right here."
00:26:41.183,00:26:44.853,Tell me the family is okay.
00:26:44.853,00:26:47.689,Tell me the kids are okay.
00:26:52.610,00:26:56.990,You wanna tell me your thoughts and weigh in?
00:26:56.990,00:27:02.371,Does this sound like a plan that you can get behind?
00:27:02.371,00:27:06.959,You miserable piece of shit.
00:27:09.503,00:27:11.046,You set me up.
00:27:11.046,00:27:12.465,I what?
00:27:12.465,00:27:16.510,"You gave my score to another crew, and now you're setting me up."
00:27:16.510,00:27:19.346,What the--? What?
00:27:19.346,00:27:21.599,You're talking like a person with head trauma.
00:27:21.599,00:27:23.517,You think you're funny?
00:27:23.517,00:27:25.519,You're saying you had nothing to do with this?
00:27:25.519,00:27:27.354,That was your van outside the house.
00:27:27.354,00:27:28.646,You weren't there?
00:27:28.646,00:27:31.609,"Yeah, I was there."
00:27:31.609,00:27:33.777,I was casing the place.
00:27:33.777,00:27:37.448,"Figuring out the best way in and out, what time they went to bed, all that."
00:27:37.448,00:27:40.867,They were fine when I left.
00:27:40.867,00:27:43.537,You had nothing to do with the Kettlemans?
00:27:43.537,00:27:46.748,I was never in the house.
00:27:48.917,00:27:51.545,What about the blood in your van?
00:27:51.545,00:28:01.096,"They DNA my ride, all they're gonna find is the blood of your skate rat twins, plus whatever piss and shit you leaked out when you were in there."
00:28:01.096,00:28:04.891,Nobody's been in the back of that van since.
00:28:08.479,00:28:09.855,I don't understand.
00:28:09.855,00:28:14.860,"Here's what I understand, counselor."
00:28:14.860,00:28:19.031,I told my plan to one other person.
00:28:19.031,00:28:20.616,One.
00:28:20.616,00:28:22.201,You.
00:28:22.201,00:28:25.412,Now here I am under arrest.
00:28:25.412,00:28:27.623,Go figure.
00:28:27.623,00:28:31.793,I don't know anything about a setup or another crew. Heh.
00:28:34.463,00:28:37.341,You know what?
00:28:37.341,00:28:47.309,"The cops are out there right now poking into my business, and if they find something on me or my partners, for real, it's gonna be bad for you."
00:28:47.309,00:28:49.520,Really bad.
00:28:51.647,00:28:53.482,Bad?
00:28:53.482,00:28:54.774,Bad as in...?
00:28:54.774,00:29:01.240,"You get me out of here today, or you're a dead man."
00:29:21.719,00:29:24.304,"Oh, hey."
00:29:24.304,00:29:26.181,I asked if you knew anything.
00:29:26.181,00:29:28.726,You didn't tell me you were representing the lead suspect.
00:29:28.726,00:29:31.770,I didn't know at the time.
00:29:31.770,00:29:33.021,What?
00:29:33.021,00:29:35.482,Did he tell you where the family is?
00:29:35.482,00:29:37.067,He doesn't know.
00:29:37.067,00:29:39.861,What does that mean?
00:29:39.861,00:29:41.614,He doesn't know because he didn't do it.
00:29:41.614,00:29:42.822,Give me a break.
00:29:42.822,00:29:45.284,"Guys, can you give us just a minute?"
00:29:48.537,00:29:51.415,"Jimmy, that family is in real danger."
00:29:51.415,00:29:54.084,You don't have to stand behind attorney/client privilege.
00:29:54.084,00:29:55.628,I'm not.
00:29:55.628,00:29:58.672,These people can be buried in a box sucking air through a straw.
00:29:58.672,00:30:00.382,I'm sorry if that's where they are.
00:30:00.382,00:30:03.761,But my guy didn't do it.
00:30:05.554,00:30:06.972,You know what you're gonna do?
00:30:06.972,00:30:10.976,You're gonna get your special CSI people and test the blood from that van.
00:30:10.976,00:30:16.231,I guarantee you one billion percent it's not the Kettlemans'.
00:30:16.231,00:30:19.067,It's not the Kettlemans'.
00:30:19.067,00:30:22.571,"That'll take weeks, if we can even get a sample to compare it to."
00:30:22.571,00:30:24.906,"Well, isn't that convenient?"
00:30:24.906,00:30:30.996,You've got an innocent man in there right now who I demand you release with an apology.
00:30:30.996,00:30:33.290,There are no other suspects.
00:30:30.996,00:30:35.459,There's no evidence that points to anyone else.
00:30:35.459,00:30:38.128,I wanna see the crime scene.
00:30:38.128,00:30:40.172,"RUSSO: Screw you, missing something."
00:30:40.172,00:30:44.468,"No, detectives, I, um..."
00:30:44.468,00:30:46.428,A good idea?
00:30:46.428,00:30:48.972,We should invite Mr. McGill to the house.
00:30:48.972,00:30:52.351,Why?
00:30:59.191,00:31:01.067,"RUSSO: So, what'd we miss?"
00:31:23.089,00:31:26.844,"This is the son's room, Warren."
00:31:26.844,00:31:28.595,Twelve years old.
00:31:44.486,00:31:46.446,Jo Jo's room.
00:31:47.698,00:31:50.367,KIM: She's 7.
00:31:59.292,00:32:03.463,"All right, you wanted me to crack, mission accomplished."
00:32:03.463,00:32:06.299,"But I'm telling you, my client didn't do this."
00:32:06.299,00:32:09.177,Varga was outside the night the family disappeared.
00:32:09.177,00:32:10.429,That is a fact.
00:32:10.429,00:32:14.307,Advocate for the guy all you want after we get these people back safe.
00:32:14.307,00:32:17.394,"In the meantime, help us."
00:32:17.394,00:32:18.771,Where's the doll?
00:32:18.771,00:32:20.564,Where's the what?
00:32:20.564,00:32:27.320,"Uh, got little shoes, bunch of clothes, table and chairs, hairbrush, but where's the doll that goes with this?"
00:32:27.320,00:32:30.657,"In every picture of this girl, she's holding the same doll."
00:32:30.657,00:32:33.577,So where's the doll?
00:32:33.577,00:32:39.792,"Doll is gone, girl is gone, which means doll and girl are most likely together, which means-- I have no idea."
00:32:39.792,00:32:44.588,"JIMMY: Which means the kid wasn't dragged out of the house, ipso facto."
00:32:44.588,00:32:46.381,Wait.
00:32:47.674,00:32:50.427,Maybe the Kettlemans kidnapped themselves.
00:32:53.513,00:32:54.890,That's it.
00:32:54.890,00:32:56.516,Let's go.
00:32:56.516,00:32:58.560,How? Why would they do that?
00:32:58.560,00:33:01.354,"They stole million dollars plus, right?"
00:33:01.354,00:33:04.107,"You wanna get away with that cash, what do you do?"
00:33:04.107,00:33:05.734,Run?
00:33:05.734,00:33:08.445,"If you run, everyone knows you're guilty."
00:33:08.445,00:33:12.658,"Ah. But if you're kidnapped, you're a victim. Right?"
00:33:12.658,00:33:15.452,They staged this to throw everyone off.
00:33:15.452,00:33:17.370,You guys are looking in the wrong place.
00:33:17.370,00:33:20.791,Who knows how many miles into Mexico or Canada they could be?
00:33:20.791,00:33:23.251,You gotta put the word out.
00:33:23.251,00:33:26.964,"Oh, come on, you don't think it's possible I'm right?"
00:33:26.964,00:33:29.341,It's possible.
00:33:29.341,00:33:32.051,JIMMY: Unlikely?
00:33:32.051,00:33:35.138,There's no record of a taxi or car service to the house.
00:33:35.138,00:33:37.766,They didn't get on any planes or buses or trains.
00:33:37.766,00:33:41.227,You checked all that?
00:33:41.227,00:33:43.689,We saw it was missing.
00:33:43.689,00:33:45.398,"The girl was scared, crying."
00:33:45.398,00:33:49.444,Bad guy lets the kid take the doll to shut her up.
00:33:49.444,00:33:52.656,What? You don't think that's possible?
00:33:53.907,00:33:56.493,"I need to talk to you, alone."
00:33:58.620,00:34:01.832,"I've gotta tell you something, and promise not to be upset."
00:34:01.832,00:34:05.084,No way am I making that promise.
00:34:05.084,00:34:07.796,"After I hung up with you, I gave them a warning call."
00:34:07.796,00:34:09.006,A warning call?
00:34:09.006,00:34:12.300,"I was worried my guy Varga was going after their money, and he was."
00:34:12.300,00:34:13.844,He was gonna rip them off.
00:34:13.844,00:34:16.346,I deduced it from a conversation we had.
00:34:20.266,00:34:24.396,But I called the Kettlemans anonymously to warn them.
00:34:24.396,00:34:26.982,Anonymously? You did--?
00:34:26.982,00:34:29.150,"You didn't do the sex robot voice, did you?"
00:34:29.150,00:34:36.366,"I did, the tube and the whole thing, which probably scared the living shit out of them, and they took off."
00:34:34.364,00:34:41.580,"Which, you know, file that under unintended consequences, but you believe me now?"
00:34:41.580,00:34:46.167,Uh-- Great.
00:34:46.167,00:34:54.009,"Or better yet, get the cops to let Varga go, because right now my ass is on the highway to the danger zone."
00:34:54.009,00:34:56.553,Why are you in danger?
00:34:54.009,00:35:00.599,"Nacho Varga, he didn't kidnap the family, but he's a bad guy."
00:35:08.982,00:35:11.150,turn me into a meat piñata.
00:35:11.150,00:35:12.611,"Jimmy, tell the police."
00:35:12.611,00:35:14.696,There's no way I'm gonna rat on this guy.
00:35:14.696,00:35:16.823,I will never be safe.
00:35:16.823,00:35:22.579,"I have to convince the cops I'm right, get them to stop looking at Nacho and catch the Kettlemans on the run."
00:35:22.579,00:35:24.247,And if they never catch them?
00:35:24.247,00:35:27.876,The Kettlemans?
00:35:27.876,00:35:29.920,They're not exactly masterminds.
00:35:29.920,00:35:32.422,They will be caught if the cops are looking.
00:35:32.422,00:35:34.382,"So you tell them to, would you?"
00:35:34.382,00:35:36.802,The FBI too. I heard they're getting in on this.
00:35:36.802,00:35:40.639,Why would the FBI listen to me?
00:35:40.639,00:35:42.223,"APD, at least."
00:35:42.223,00:35:45.310,"You talk to Howard, you explain things to him."
00:35:45.310,00:35:47.312,He has clout with these people.
00:35:47.312,00:35:49.188,"What, is that a no, or...?"
00:35:49.188,00:35:51.858,Hamlin will never agree to it.
00:35:51.858,00:35:53.526,This would mean incriminating them.
00:35:53.526,00:35:56.446,You see? This is why people hate lawyers.
00:35:56.446,00:35:59.950,"It's Hamlin's call, and Hamlin will never agree."
00:35:59.950,00:36:03.202,"And even if it were up to me, you know I couldn't."
00:36:04.830,00:36:07.874,"I'm sorry, I just-- I get it."
00:36:12.879,00:36:15.048,Where are you going?
00:36:12.879,00:36:17.843,"I'm gonna go talk to Nacho, try to make him see reason."
00:36:17.843,00:36:19.552,To beg.
00:36:27.853,00:36:29.146,Come on.
00:36:29.146,00:36:31.272,Come on.
00:36:40.323,00:36:43.994,"Right. Yeah, hey. Ahem."
00:36:43.994,00:36:47.122,"I was a jerk, okay?"
00:36:47.122,00:36:52.169,So I will pay you what I owe you plus interest if you just let me come through.
00:36:57.382,00:37:00.426,I suggest you find parking somewhere else.
00:37:00.426,00:37:02.888,"Somewhere else, as in where, somewhere else?"
00:37:02.888,00:37:04.389,Not my concern.
00:37:04.389,00:37:08.060,"Actually, this is your job, so by definition it's your concern."
00:37:08.060,00:37:12.856,"So pump out the ticket and open the stupid gate already, please."
00:37:12.856,00:37:16.193,"I mean, I don't have time for this."
00:37:20.197,00:37:25.077,All-- All right.
00:37:27.829,00:37:32.042,Great.
00:37:32.042,00:37:34.002,I don't think you wanna be doing that.
00:37:34.002,00:37:36.671,"JIMMY: Oh, yeah?"
00:37:36.671,00:37:39.298,"What are you gonna do, you got a poop-filled diaper in there?"
00:37:39.298,00:37:40.717,You gonna throw it at me?
00:37:40.717,00:37:44.096,"Are you gonna gum me to death, huh, geezer?"
00:37:44.096,00:37:46.139,Oh! Aah! Ow! Ow!
00:37:47.766,00:37:49.684,Ow! Ow!
00:37:51.228,00:37:55.732,We're talking about a family.
00:37:55.732,00:38:01.238,"Lawyer's got this bullshit theory about them staging this, running off with the money."
00:38:01.238,00:38:03.073,Yeah. County treasurer embezzled funds.
00:38:03.073,00:38:04.365,I read the paper.
00:38:04.365,00:38:06.659,We got this gangbanger dead to rights.
00:38:06.659,00:38:10.705,Only problem is your guy over there.
00:38:10.705,00:38:14.000,He needs to help us get his scumbag client to talk.
00:38:14.000,00:38:16.169,"So, what do you say?"
00:38:16.169,00:38:18.296,Help us do some good.
00:38:20.715,00:38:22.092,Sure.
00:38:22.092,00:38:24.761,"Okay, you assaulted this man."
00:38:24.761,00:38:27.555,I barely touched the guy.
00:38:27.555,00:38:29.348,Finger. I laid finger on him.
00:38:29.348,00:38:32.144,"RUSSO: Whatever your interpretation, it was still assault."
00:38:36.231,00:38:38.900,Get your client to tell us where he has the family stashed.
00:38:38.900,00:38:42.070,"Guys, I'm the definition of a broken record on this."
00:38:42.070,00:38:44.906,"Nacho is not your man, comprendo?"
00:38:44.906,00:38:48.201,Nobody took the Kettlemans.
00:38:48.201,00:38:52.289,"You gonna keep playing that line, it's gonna go rough."
00:38:52.289,00:38:54.499,You know what?
00:38:54.499,00:38:58.295,"All right, let's go. To booking."
00:38:58.295,00:38:59.838,Perfect end to a perfect day.
00:38:59.838,00:39:02.465,Wait a second.
00:39:02.465,00:39:05.093,"I'm sorry, what?"
00:39:05.093,00:39:07.846,We talked about this.
00:39:07.846,00:39:09.931,"No. No, I don't."
00:39:09.931,00:39:12.350,"What are you doing, buddy?"
00:39:13.810,00:39:16.271,"No, I don't think I said that, buddy."
00:39:16.271,00:39:19.024,"RUSSO: What, you get a chance to do the right thing and puss out?"
00:39:19.024,00:39:23.862,Mm... Yeah.
00:39:26.239,00:39:34.789,"Hey, Cagney, Lacey, when you realize how wrong you are about all this, I'll take an edible arrangement as a sorry, heavy on the pineapple."
00:39:38.793,00:39:43.340,JIMMY: Hey. Hold up. How come you let me off the hook back there?
00:39:43.340,00:39:44.799,I'm going back to work.
00:39:44.799,00:39:46.718,Why don't you quit while you're ahead?
00:39:46.718,00:39:50.972,I refuse to believe it's because you have something resembling a heart inside your body.
00:39:50.972,00:39:55.310,You're not gonna have a heart inside your body in about five seconds.
00:39:55.310,00:39:56.895,I already know why you did it.
00:39:56.895,00:39:59.189,Yeah? Why's that?
00:39:59.189,00:40:00.773,Because you believe me.
00:40:00.773,00:40:03.526,That family kidnapped themselves.
00:40:05.737,00:40:07.322,"All right, I believe you."
00:40:07.322,00:40:11.368,I knew it. I knew it.
00:40:12.952,00:40:15.247,Why do you believe me?
00:40:15.247,00:40:18.833,Your story makes sense.
00:40:18.833,00:40:23.255,"Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house."
00:40:23.255,00:40:24.547,No record of them leaving.
00:40:24.547,00:40:26.091,How'd they get out of the country?
00:40:26.091,00:40:27.592,They didn't.
00:40:27.592,00:40:30.053,Odds are they didn't get out of the neighborhood.
00:40:30.053,00:40:33.348,Come again?
00:40:30.053,00:40:36.601,"Look, when I was still on the job back in Philly, we had this case."
00:40:36.601,00:40:38.686,"Hold up, hold up."
00:40:38.686,00:40:42.523,"On the job, as in, you were a cop on the job?"
00:40:42.523,00:40:45.318,This bookie disappeared after the Super Bowl.
00:40:45.318,00:40:47.153,Cowboys-Steelers.
00:40:47.153,00:40:51.532,Took $6 million in bets and skipped town when things didn't go his way.
00:40:51.532,00:40:58.748,"Everybody thought he was on the beach in the Bahamas, or dead in the Jersey Pine Barrens. Wasn't the case."
00:40:58.748,00:41:02.543,He was two doors down from where he lived in a foreclosed house.
00:41:02.543,00:41:05.880,Hid there for six months without anyone suspecting him.
00:41:05.880,00:41:07.966,But why? Why not run?
00:41:07.966,00:41:10.802,That's what everybody expects.
00:41:10.802,00:41:13.596,It's human nature to want to stay close to home.
00:41:13.596,00:41:18.310,"And if this Kettleman figured out how to do it, that's what he did."
00:41:21.396,00:41:23.898,Nobody wants to leave home.
00:44:13.151,00:44:15.903,WOMAN: Okay? Let's do this. And...
00:44:15.903,00:44:44.890,"KETTLEMANS: Hey, it's me. Listen to this."
00:44:48.686,00:44:50.687,You hear that?
00:44:53.983,00:44:55.734,It's a long story.
00:44:55.734,00:44:58.737,"Look, I'm taking them back to their place."
00:44:58.737,00:45:02.450,We'll meet you there.
00:45:10.124,00:45:12.418,Yeah. I think we have time for one more before bed.
00:45:12.418,00:45:14.170,Do we have to?
00:45:14.170,00:45:19.300,"Oh, hey, I don't know about you, but I would love a little John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt."
00:45:19.300,00:45:21.177,You know what?
00:45:19.300,00:45:22.803,"Let's really have fun with this one, okay, Kettle-team?"
00:45:22.803,00:45:25.598,Let's do this. And...
00:45:27.475,00:45:30.436,"Hey. Hey, Warren. Hey, Jo Jo."
00:45:30.436,00:45:32.146,"I'm your uncle Jimmy, all right?"
00:45:32.146,00:45:36.150,"Now, your parents are gonna take you down the mountain back to your house."
00:45:36.150,00:45:37.485,That sound good?
00:45:37.485,00:45:39.654,"Uh, we..."
00:45:39.654,00:45:41.197,"Mr. McGill, can we talk about this?"
00:45:41.197,00:45:43.533,"No, we can't. Okay?"
00:45:43.533,00:45:46.160,Pack up your stuff because we're heading back.
00:45:46.160,00:45:49.121,Civilization awaits.
00:45:50.498,00:45:53.000,"Look, please, can we just talk this through?"
00:45:53.000,00:45:58.423,"Not an option. You do this on your own recognizance, or the cops drag you by your heels."
00:45:58.423,00:46:02.134,"Let's go. Kettlemans, BETSY: No. No."
00:46:02.134,00:46:06.347,"Yes, you are. This is happening."
00:46:06.347,00:46:07.724,"JIMMY: Yes, Kettlemans."
00:46:07.724,00:46:09.766,No!
00:46:27.159,00:46:28.827,Yeah.
00:00:10.928,00:00:13.388,"JIMMY: Works every-- I'm telling you, every time."
00:00:13.388,00:00:15.265,"Do it, try it."
00:00:15.265,00:00:16.851,Right here.
00:00:18.477,00:00:21.229,Kind of. Kind of that.
00:00:21.229,00:00:22.815,"All right, man."
00:00:22.815,00:00:24.149,"All right, bro, I'll work on it."
00:00:24.149,00:00:27.027,"But just tell me, when do you--?"
00:00:27.027,00:00:30.030,Right before the cork pops.
00:00:27.027,00:00:32.032,"Timing's important, but-- But you don't do it, like, in her ear?"
00:00:32.032,00:00:33.659,"No, you don't do it in her ear."
00:00:33.659,00:00:35.911,It's a given you don't do it in her ear.
00:00:35.911,00:00:38.580,This is scientifically proven.
00:00:38.580,00:00:41.333,Prehistoric stuff. The medulla.
00:00:41.333,00:00:42.960,The wolf brain.
00:00:42.960,00:00:45.170,It's primitive stuff.
00:00:46.588,00:00:48.841,STEVIE: Yeah!
00:00:48.841,00:00:51.719,STEVIE: That's the wolf brain!
00:00:51.719,00:00:55.681,"STEVIE: Ha. Man, this town sucks."
00:00:55.681,00:00:59.560,"Sorry, bro, I know it's yours and everything, but it's not even 2."
00:00:59.560,00:01:02.312,"JIMMY: Yeah, it does kind of suck."
00:01:02.312,00:01:07.067,"Hey, I know this after-hours place over-- A couple blocks off Cermak."
00:01:10.029,00:01:13.448,Fuckin' hit it.
00:01:13.448,00:01:15.826,JIMMY: That's what I'm talking about.
00:01:15.826,00:01:17.327,STEVIE: Whoo!
00:01:20.998,00:01:22.332,JIMMY: Okay.
00:01:25.210,00:01:27.462,"Not in her ear, right?"
00:01:27.462,00:01:30.049,"Hey, bro, I never did catch your name."
00:01:30.049,00:01:32.968,Saul.
00:01:32.968,00:01:35.345,"S'all good, man."
00:01:35.345,00:01:39.641,Get it?
00:01:39.641,00:01:41.518,"Hey, hey, brother, whoa."
00:01:41.518,00:01:44.103,Check it out. What is that?
00:01:45.773,00:01:48.191,Holy shit.
00:01:48.191,00:01:50.527,There's gotta be at least a thousand bucks in here.
00:01:50.527,00:01:53.405,"Oh, my God, look at that."
00:01:53.405,00:01:55.449,Whose is it?
00:01:55.449,00:01:59.954,"Hey, possession's like four-tenths of the what-do-you-call-it, bro."
00:01:59.954,00:02:02.539,"Like, is there an ID or...?"
00:02:04.374,00:02:07.502,"I don't know, some fat guy."
00:02:12.507,00:02:15.135,I'm thinking that one.
00:02:17.012,00:02:19.765,Let's see.
00:02:32.319,00:02:33.862,Jesus.
00:02:33.862,00:02:35.363,"Is he, uh...?"
00:02:35.363,00:02:37.282,What?
00:02:37.282,00:02:38.909,I don't know.
00:02:54.173,00:02:56.217,Ah!
00:02:56.217,00:02:58.553,"Hey, fella. You all right?"
00:03:05.519,00:03:07.479,"Hey, buddy."
00:03:07.479,00:03:09.064,"Hey, would you answer me?"
00:03:09.064,00:03:11.608,"Hey, answer this, you butthole."
00:03:12.943,00:03:17.489,"Hey, uh-- Hey, bro, be nice, all right?"
00:03:17.489,00:03:20.159,"This guy right here, he's trying to help you."
00:03:20.159,00:03:23.411,"Help yourself to some of this, you butthole."
00:03:23.411,00:03:25.455,STEVIE: Hey.
00:03:25.455,00:03:27.541,All right? So stop saying that.
00:03:30.752,00:03:33.463,"JIMMY: Hey, man, what's your problem?"
00:03:33.463,00:03:37.092,My problem is I'm standing here talking to a couple buttholes.
00:03:37.092,00:03:39.178,"Actually, you're not standing, you fat bastard."
00:03:39.178,00:03:41.180,You're laying on your fat ass.
00:03:41.180,00:03:43.515,"Hey, I'll roundhouse-kick you right in your heads."
00:03:43.515,00:03:45.100,You think I won't?
00:03:45.100,00:03:50.898,"I'll come into the McDonald's where you work, I'll buy the whole damn place and I'll fire you."
00:03:50.898,00:03:55.610,"I'll say, Drop your mops, you buttholes, because you're fired."
00:03:55.610,00:04:01.241,And then I'll roundhouse-kick you right in your stupid heads.
00:04:01.241,00:04:06.788,"And then I'll go Jean-Claude Van Damme on you, you..."
00:04:08.999,00:04:10.709,Butthole.
00:04:13.170,00:04:15.839,I'm keeping the money.
00:04:15.839,00:04:17.174,"Here you go, fatty."
00:04:17.174,00:04:20.219,"I got dibs on that watch, man."
00:04:21.887,00:04:23.638,I didn't see that.
00:04:26.975,00:04:28.894,What kind is it?
00:04:31.146,00:04:32.981,"I don't know, it's just a watch."
00:04:32.981,00:04:35.025,"We gotta get out of here, man."
00:04:35.025,00:04:36.985,What kind of watch is it?
00:04:36.985,00:04:41.698,"It's-- I don't know, it's-- Well, then let me look at it."
00:04:43.283,00:04:45.786,It's a damn Rolex.
00:04:45.786,00:04:48.413,"Not cool to be greedy, bro."
00:04:48.413,00:04:53.293,I didn't know what-- So how do you wanna split this up?
00:04:53.293,00:04:55.378,Tell you what.
00:04:55.378,00:04:57.756,I'll just keep the watch.
00:04:57.756,00:04:59.507,What?
00:04:59.507,00:05:01.885,No.
00:05:01.885,00:05:03.804,"Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now."
00:05:03.804,00:05:05.806,Let's figure this out.
00:05:05.806,00:05:07.975,"All right, you're right."
00:05:07.975,00:05:10.310,I will sweeten the pot.
00:05:10.310,00:05:14.148,"You got 5, 20, 40, 60, 80-- Five hundred and eighty bucks."
00:05:14.148,00:05:16.483,"Add that to the thousand, it's more than half."
00:05:16.483,00:05:18.401,What do you know about that thing?
00:05:18.401,00:05:19.903,Is it worth more than 3?
00:05:19.903,00:05:22.363,"No, I don't know, but we're good, right?"
00:05:22.363,00:05:24.574,"Yeah, we good? Okay?"
00:05:24.574,00:05:26.118,I don't know.
00:05:28.662,00:05:30.164,"Later, sucker!"
00:05:49.516,00:05:51.310,MAN: Six left.
00:05:51.310,00:05:53.770,Can we get more?
00:05:53.770,00:05:55.480,It's like a license to print money.
00:05:55.480,00:05:57.565,Heh. Thing of beauty.
00:05:57.565,00:06:01.111,"Hey, what was that crazy stuff about roundhouse kicks?"
00:06:01.111,00:06:03.322,Where did you get that?
00:06:03.322,00:06:06.241,"Just something in my brain, you know? It just came out."
00:06:06.241,00:06:08.618,Too much?
00:06:08.618,00:06:13.332,"It was, like, deep or something."
00:06:13.332,00:06:16.417,"Wanna talk about brilliant, I mean..."
00:06:16.417,00:06:18.670,You're the man.
00:06:18.670,00:06:21.380,"I love watching you work, man."
00:06:23.758,00:06:27.679,It's good for making beer money.
00:06:53.830,00:06:55.582,"BETSY: Please, no one has to know."
00:06:55.582,00:06:58.043,You could just pretend you didn't find us.
00:06:58.043,00:07:00.379,"We would never tell anyone, would we, Craig?"
00:07:00.379,00:07:02.130,"CRAIG: No, absolutely not."
00:07:02.130,00:07:04.341,I already called your lawyer.
00:07:09.470,00:07:11.973,The cops are investigating this as a kidnapping.
00:07:11.973,00:07:15.936,They already rounded up some poor suspect.
00:07:15.936,00:07:18.105,A working-class guy.
00:07:18.105,00:07:20.190,"A father, I think."
00:07:20.190,00:07:24.152,"But anyway, you two, you almost ruined someone's life."
00:07:24.152,00:07:26.238,Potentially several someones.
00:07:26.238,00:07:27.781,We had no idea.
00:07:27.781,00:07:31.410,Could this have been the person in the van?
00:07:31.410,00:07:34.288,What if the man they arrested is the one we were warned about?
00:07:34.288,00:07:37.832,"Yeah, maybe he's not so innocent. Hm?"
00:07:37.832,00:07:39.626,Warned? Warned how?
00:07:39.626,00:07:43.380,BETSY: We had a phone call.
00:07:43.380,00:07:45.090,They said someone was coming for us.
00:07:45.090,00:07:49.970,"And there was a van outside the house, as if whoever was inside was watching us."
00:07:49.970,00:07:52.472,Mm-hm.
00:07:49.970,00:07:54.682,"And once that drove off, we did what we did."
00:07:56.226,00:08:03.108,"I wouldn't know about any of that, I just-- Ahem. I can assure you that you and your family are safe."
00:08:03.108,00:08:04.859,"The police are all over this thing, so..."
00:08:04.859,00:08:06.445,BETSY: It doesn't matter.
00:08:06.445,00:08:08.989,We can't just go back.
00:08:08.989,00:08:12.951,Our case.
00:08:12.951,00:08:14.869,Can't you just call Ms. Wexler again?
00:08:14.869,00:08:17.331,Tell her you didn't see us after all.
00:08:17.331,00:08:21.293,"If they think I ran away, it'll look like I did something wrong."
00:08:21.293,00:08:25.797,"Yeah, and we can't risk losing everything just because of some teensy mistake."
00:08:25.797,00:08:27.132,Can I ask you something?
00:08:27.132,00:08:29.426,What were you hoping would happen?
00:08:29.426,00:08:32.595,"I mean, before I found you, what were you planning to do?"
00:08:32.595,00:08:36.724,"Well, we were in the process of, you know, working that out, when you, um..."
00:08:36.724,00:08:38.977,"We were working that out, yeah."
00:08:38.977,00:08:44.024,"All right, well, you've still got a little bit of maneuverability, all right?"
00:08:44.024,00:08:45.650,"You're outdoorsy, right?"
00:08:45.650,00:08:47.444,So you went on an impromptu camping trip.
00:08:47.444,00:08:50.989,"I don't know, it's something people do, apparently. Uh..."
00:08:50.989,00:08:57.496,"You left the house a mess, and you kicked in your own front door because it's a free country."
00:08:57.496,00:09:00.081,Kim Wexler is very good.
00:09:00.081,00:09:02.250,What about the money?
00:09:04.252,00:09:06.796,"If she knows about it, she'll tell. Right?"
00:09:06.796,00:09:09.132,"I mean, she'll have to tell."
00:09:09.132,00:09:13.970,"Well, like they say in Silicon Valley, It's not a bug, it's a feature."
00:09:13.970,00:09:16.639,You ever hear of a bargaining chip?
00:09:16.639,00:09:20.143,What we have right here is the mother of all bargaining chips.
00:09:20.143,00:09:22.562,As in...
00:09:22.562,00:09:24.814,you expect us to give this back?
00:09:27.108,00:09:29.694,We are not giving this back.
00:09:29.694,00:09:33.281,We are not guilty.
00:09:33.281,00:09:34.866,"We-- Well, I mean, Craig earned it."
00:09:34.866,00:09:36.993,I worked very hard.
00:09:36.993,00:09:39.746,"Weekends, holidays, all unpaid."
00:09:39.746,00:09:44.459,"Always. And really, just because you're salary doesn't mean you don't deserve overtime."
00:09:44.459,00:09:45.919,I think that's only fair.
00:09:45.919,00:09:48.004,"Really, that's what this is about, right?"
00:09:48.004,00:09:49.339,Fairness.
00:09:56.430,00:09:59.307,Human slavery.
00:09:59.307,00:10:03.395,"Yeah, this is right up there with that."
00:10:11.945,00:10:16.199,"Please, just don't tell anyone about the money."
00:10:16.199,00:10:17.742,I can't take a bribe.
00:10:17.742,00:10:19.619,Who would know?
00:10:19.619,00:10:21.580,"Yeah, take it."
00:10:21.580,00:10:24.458,"Please, didn't you say that you wanted to help us?"
00:10:24.458,00:10:27.877,Just pretend you never saw the money. How hard is that?
00:10:27.877,00:10:30.046,Take it.
00:10:30.046,00:10:31.506,Take it.
00:10:31.506,00:10:33.925,I can't-- I can't take a bribe.
00:10:38.263,00:10:40.014,But you know what I ca--?
00:10:40.014,00:10:41.641,I can take a retainer.
00:10:42.601,00:10:43.977,A retainer?
00:10:43.977,00:10:45.479,"Yeah, for my services..."
00:10:45.479,00:10:47.606,as your lawyer.
00:10:47.606,00:10:51.192,You're not our lawyer.
00:10:51.192,00:11:08.709,"Look, I know that HHM is shiny and it's slick and it's chock-full of lawyers, and compared to them I'm like a kiddie lemonade stand trying to compete with Walmart, but here's the thing: What are you gonna get from me that you're not gonna get from those other guys?"
00:11:08.709,00:11:11.796,Passion. Commitment.
00:11:11.796,00:11:14.174,Ask yourself this: Who found you?
00:11:14.174,00:11:19.471,I don't see Howard Hamlin ruining his $300 Gucci loafers out here.
00:11:19.471,00:11:21.806,"If you're with me, you're my number one client."
00:11:21.806,00:11:24.476,"Morning, noon or night, you call me, I'm there."
00:11:24.476,00:11:27.728,I would be singularly devoted to you.
00:11:31.024,00:11:33.985,Why not?
00:11:33.985,00:11:35.236,BETSY: I'm sorry.
00:11:35.236,00:11:36.863,You're just...
00:11:39.199,00:11:42.160,Just what?
00:11:42.160,00:11:46.747,You're the kind of lawyer guilty people hire.
00:12:17.111,00:12:18.488,Did it make the paper?
00:12:19.531,00:12:21.658,What?
00:12:21.658,00:12:23.618,Did what make the paper?
00:12:23.618,00:12:27.622,"Okay, well, probably missed the deadline, but check it out tomorrow morning."
00:12:34.713,00:12:36.214,"Camping, you know?"
00:12:36.214,00:12:38.007,Pretty much right in their own backyard.
00:12:38.007,00:12:41.177,"Well, ahem, five miles above it. Jesus."
00:12:41.177,00:12:43.762,The night I had.
00:12:43.762,00:12:47.642,"But, I mean, can you believe it?"
00:12:47.642,00:12:51.854,I guess you can.
00:12:47.642,00:12:56.901,"It's just, you know, you assume that criminals are gonna be smarter than they are."
00:12:56.901,00:13:00.905,"I don't know, it kind of breaks my heart a little."
00:13:04.701,00:13:07.746,"Not the loquacious sort, are you?"
00:13:07.746,00:13:11.708,We can't all be as blessed as you.
00:13:11.708,00:13:15.712,"Well, thanks for your help."
00:13:15.712,00:13:19.132,"And, uh, if you ever need any assistance..."
00:13:35.523,00:13:37.816,"Whoa, whoa, why is my client in handcuffs?"
00:13:37.816,00:13:40.487,This man is innocent.
00:13:40.487,00:13:43.197,Why on earth would he be cuffed?
00:13:43.197,00:13:45.325,"Go ahead, take them off."
00:13:45.325,00:13:48.411,"Free at last. Hey, did he tell you the good news?"
00:13:48.411,00:13:50.747,Never even kidnapped.
00:13:50.747,00:13:54.751,A family can't go on a little vacation without the whole city going on lockdown?
00:13:54.751,00:13:57.712,Where is your partner?
00:13:57.712,00:14:00.507,Because we expect an apology from him as well as you.
00:14:00.507,00:14:03.718,"You really don't wanna push your luck with me, scumbag."
00:14:03.718,00:14:06.638,"We got eyes on you, asshole."
00:14:06.638,00:14:08.515,Just one.
00:14:08.515,00:14:10.433,"Well, you're both very pretty, so..."
00:14:16.564,00:14:25.532,"Well, ahem, I believe I did more than what you asked of me, so that would make us square, yes?"
00:14:25.532,00:14:26.907,Great.
00:14:28.827,00:14:31.496,You need a ride?
00:14:33.039,00:14:35.124,You expect me to believe that shit?
00:14:35.124,00:14:39.504,"Yeah, I know."
00:14:39.504,00:14:42.716,They decide to go camping right after I run my little offer by you?
00:14:42.716,00:14:47.428,Could be argued that all of life is one great coincidence.
00:14:51.641,00:14:57.146,"Somebody told those people to, um, go camping."
00:14:57.146,00:15:00.358,Somebody warned them.
00:15:00.358,00:15:04.237,Ahem. They're very woodsy.
00:15:00.358,00:15:06.823,"And between you and me, they're pretty rash when it comes to the decision-making."
00:15:06.823,00:15:09.534,They're not really the plan-ahead types.
00:15:09.534,00:15:14.038,"Yeah, I'd cut the cute attitude right about now if I were you."
00:15:14.038,00:15:18.167,You ratted on me.
00:15:19.794,00:15:25.425,"JIMMY: Hey, if somebody warned the Kettlemans, it was probably somebody who was worried about those kids."
00:15:29.804,00:15:31.514,You know how much trouble you caused me?
00:15:31.514,00:15:33.767,You didn't need any help getting caught.
00:15:33.767,00:15:36.853,Okay? The neighbor ID'd you.
00:15:36.853,00:15:40.899,"Any trouble you might have, that's on you."
00:15:40.899,00:15:43.818,Not to mention the blood in your van.
00:15:43.818,00:15:47.488,"Here's a thought: Ajax, Formula 409."
00:15:47.488,00:15:52.410,You have no idea the tap dance I had to give those cops to get you out of here.
00:15:52.410,00:15:55.413,You gave them probable cause out the wazoo.
00:15:55.413,00:16:05.673,"Now, whoever the somebody is who may have warned the Kettlemans, got them out of there before you did anything even more stupid."
00:16:05.673,00:16:14.933,"You should be thanking this Good Samaritan because whoever he is, he did you a favor."
00:17:11.197,00:17:14.534,"Okay, I'm thinking hourly here."
00:17:14.534,00:17:24.544,"There were some special circumstances, so our elite-tier pricing would be $950 an hour."
00:17:24.544,00:17:27.421,Round off to 20 hours.
00:17:28.715,00:17:31.009,Nineteen thousand.
00:17:31.009,00:17:34.721,Plus 1000 for travel expenses.
00:17:34.721,00:17:38.182,"Consulting fees, 1500."
00:17:38.182,00:17:40.810,"And, uh, research."
00:17:40.810,00:17:42.645,Five for filing fees.
00:17:42.645,00:17:44.146,I ate on the road.
00:17:46.440,00:17:48.192,And storage fees.
00:17:52.321,00:17:54.574,Miscellaneous expenses.
00:17:58.118,00:18:03.041,"Upon this rock, I will build my church."
00:18:09.088,00:18:11.007,"TAILOR: Double-breasted or single, sir?"
00:18:11.007,00:18:14.093,"Single. And I want you to cut the arm holes high, okay?"
00:18:14.093,00:18:16.262,Of course.
00:18:16.262,00:18:17.805,Trim.
00:18:17.805,00:18:19.807,Cloth?
00:18:17.805,00:18:21.935,"Uh, oh-- Well, uh, wool."
00:18:21.935,00:18:23.686,"JIMMY: Yeah, uh..."
00:18:25.563,00:18:29.483,Super 170 Tasmanian wool.
00:18:29.483,00:18:31.986,"Beautiful choice, sir."
00:18:31.986,00:18:35.114,"Uh, navy, all right? Uh..."
00:18:35.114,00:18:37.575,"Uh-huh. Oh, that's it."
00:18:37.575,00:18:39.869,Shall we discuss shirts?
00:18:39.869,00:18:46.292,"Okay, I'm gonna need your finest sea-island cotton with a white club collar and French cuffs."
00:18:46.292,00:18:47.752,I have the very thing.
00:18:47.752,00:18:50.088,And I'm assuming you want to see some ties.
00:18:50.088,00:18:54.216,"Yeah, I was picturing something in a light-blue knit."
00:18:54.216,00:18:57.553,Okay.
00:18:54.216,00:19:00.222,"Oh, and could you make sure those are real mother-of-pearl buttons on the shirts, okay?"
00:19:01.975,00:19:04.143,Of course.
00:19:04.143,00:19:06.104,"Some coffee, David?"
00:19:35.008,00:19:37.135,"TAILOR: Ah, here we are."
00:19:39.804,00:19:41.555,Shall we?
00:19:41.555,00:19:44.767,"Yeah, let's go."
00:19:44.767,00:19:48.312,Mm. Mm-hm. Yeah.
00:19:48.312,00:19:50.898,"So, um, what do you think?"
00:19:52.274,00:19:55.736,Strawberry Fields Forever?
00:19:55.736,00:19:58.656,"No, are you crazy?"
00:19:58.656,00:20:00.199,"Yes, it is, look."
00:20:00.199,00:20:04.286,"No, no, it's way more Sassafras Glow. Way more."
00:20:04.286,00:20:07.540,Use your eyes.
00:20:07.540,00:20:09.416,"Ladies, back me up. Hey."
00:20:09.416,00:20:11.961,"Sassafras Glow, am I right?"
00:20:11.961,00:20:14.922,"Maybe Rhapsody in Blond, but..."
00:20:14.922,00:20:16.924,"See, they agree with me."
00:20:19.218,00:20:21.261,Sassafras Glow.
00:20:21.261,00:20:23.014,You're wrong.
00:20:23.014,00:20:26.266,"Big deal. I'll wash it out in the morning. No biggie, jeez."
00:20:26.266,00:20:28.394,It's bleach.
00:20:28.394,00:20:30.897,What? It's permanent?
00:20:30.897,00:20:33.983,"We'll Photoshop the color, okay?"
00:20:33.983,00:20:35.609,"Change of plan, ladies."
00:20:35.609,00:20:39.279,"I wanna go with a simple curling iron job, okay?"
00:20:39.279,00:20:43.325,"Uh, give me, like, ringlets, you know, on top."
00:20:43.325,00:20:45.494,Like Tony Curtis in Spartacus.
00:20:45.494,00:20:48.789,"Yeah, like the bath scene in Spartacus."
00:20:51.751,00:20:55.379,JIMMY: Stop talking about it.
00:21:17.651,00:21:20.320,Hello.
00:21:17.651,00:21:24.075,"You've reached the law offices of James M. McGill, Esquire, a lawyer you can trust."
00:21:24.075,00:21:29.038,"Kindly leave your information at the tone, and Mr. McGill will phone you promptly."
00:21:29.038,00:21:31.958,"Hey, uh..."
00:21:31.958,00:21:33.626,It's me. Hi.
00:21:33.626,00:21:38.172,"Anyway, The Thing is playing downtown on Saturday."
00:21:38.172,00:21:41.425,Thought you might be up for some Kurt Russell action.
00:21:41.425,00:21:46.346,"I owe you one, so why don't we just grab some dinner first, my treat?"
00:21:46.346,00:21:48.182,And...
00:21:51.727,00:21:53.020,I really wanna talk to you.
00:21:53.020,00:21:54.688,"Okay, bye."
00:21:54.688,00:21:57.441,Come in.
00:21:57.441,00:21:59.652,Hey. Hey.
00:21:59.652,00:22:02.571,How goes it?
00:22:02.571,00:22:04.657,"Tricky, for sure."
00:22:04.657,00:22:09.328,"Craig and Betsy really put us in a corner with the police, not to mention the press."
00:22:09.328,00:22:16.127,"But this camping story of theirs, they've been keeping it consistent at least."
00:22:16.127,00:22:20.047,"If it's okay with you, I think I should try to talk them into hiring a PR firm."
00:22:20.047,00:22:22.341,Certainly for the next couple of weeks.
00:22:22.341,00:22:24.260,Mm-hm.
00:22:25.511,00:22:28.055,So okay on the PR firm?
00:22:28.055,00:22:32.101,Do you have a minute?
00:22:32.101,00:22:34.020,Take a ride with me.
00:22:34.020,00:22:36.314,"KIM: Uh, okay. Uh..."
00:22:36.314,00:22:38.065,Where are we going?
00:23:02.048,00:23:04.217,Whoa.
00:23:05.592,00:23:07.594,Shit.
00:23:07.594,00:23:09.347,Yep.
00:23:10.764,00:23:15.311,"That's-- I mean, that's my suit, right?"
00:23:15.311,00:23:18.564,Am I crazy here?
00:23:18.564,00:23:20.233,Look at the logo.
00:23:20.233,00:23:24.111,That's our logo. He's just straight-up copying us.
00:23:24.111,00:23:27.614,"I mean, what the hell is he thinking with this?"
00:23:29.075,00:23:31.409,"Really, he's, you know, a free spirit."
00:23:31.409,00:23:33.411,Oh. Yeah.
00:23:33.411,00:23:35.789,That's one way to put it.
00:23:38.458,00:23:40.669,"You two are still friends, right?"
00:23:40.669,00:23:42.880,"I wouldn't exactly-- You talk, though."
00:23:42.880,00:23:45.507,Not really.
00:23:42.880,00:23:49.262,"Still, you're the one he called when he found the Kettlemans' camped halfway up the Sandias."
00:23:49.262,00:23:51.597,"He was just looking out for his own client, that's all."
00:23:51.597,00:23:53.307,"This isn't the third degree, Kim."
00:23:53.307,00:23:56.434,I really don't care one way or the other. I just...
00:24:00.022,00:24:02.649,He's really forcing my hand here.
00:24:26.548,00:24:29.218,JIMMY: Hey.
00:24:29.218,00:24:31.262,Am I interrupting?
00:24:31.262,00:24:34.932,JIMMY: Not at all.
00:24:36.309,00:24:40.187,"Sit. Have a massage, free of charge."
00:24:40.187,00:24:42.815,Okay.
00:24:42.815,00:24:47.445,"Oh, yeah. Ah."
00:24:54.492,00:24:57.955,Go for the deep-tissue setting-- Is that the small fist?
00:24:57.955,00:25:00.624,Use the-- It's three arrows.
00:25:00.624,00:25:02.709,"Yeah. Now, you feel it?"
00:25:03.836,00:25:06.588,"Ah. Now, relax, okay?"
00:25:06.588,00:25:09.591,You deserve a break today.
00:25:14.430,00:25:17.183,It's very nice.
00:25:19.018,00:25:21.895,Just one of the perks of salon living.
00:25:21.895,00:25:25.358,The others being?
00:25:25.358,00:25:28.402,Obviously.
00:25:28.402,00:25:30.363,"Uh, deep-discount mani-pedis."
00:25:30.363,00:25:32.406,Ah.
00:25:32.406,00:25:36.660,"Well, it's still a deal."
00:25:36.660,00:25:39.205,"You're living like a king, then."
00:25:55.095,00:25:56.305,What's this?
00:25:56.305,00:26:00.309,Is this a cease and desist?
00:26:00.309,00:26:03.396,How pissed was he?
00:26:03.396,00:26:06.357,"His head didn't actually explode, but pretty damn pissed."
00:26:06.357,00:26:08.817,Like this won't end well for you pissed.
00:26:08.817,00:26:10.069,Yeah.
00:26:10.069,00:26:11.904,How about that?
00:26:12.863,00:26:14.031,This is serious.
00:26:14.031,00:26:15.573,I know.
00:26:15.573,00:26:19.203,"I mean, what the hell is with that billboard?"
00:26:20.496,00:26:25.209,"I know you have a problem with Hamlin, but I just don't get your angle here."
00:26:25.209,00:26:27.961,Aren't you trying to build your own law practice?
00:26:27.961,00:26:33.675,"Instead, you're spending God knows how much money turning yourself into a little Hamlin clone."
00:26:33.675,00:26:37.012,"I mean, why are you making this personal?"
00:26:37.012,00:26:40.307,It's not personal.
00:26:40.307,00:26:42.935,It is completely and totally personal.
00:26:42.935,00:26:46.522,"No, no, no. It's not. Nope."
00:26:46.522,00:26:48.315,Stop trying to pretend.
00:26:48.315,00:26:50.067,"I can advertise, can't I?"
00:26:50.067,00:26:54.738,"What, do I have to clear everything past the great Howard?"
00:26:54.738,00:26:56.240,That billboard is not advertising.
00:26:56.240,00:26:57.991,That is a declaration of war.
00:26:57.991,00:27:00.494,Declaration of war.
00:27:00.494,00:27:02.204,You know he drives by it every day.
00:27:02.204,00:27:04.873,It's business.
00:27:04.873,00:27:07.501,You're ripping off a brand.
00:27:07.501,00:27:09.878,There is nothing original in that ad.
00:27:09.878,00:27:12.047,It certainly doesn't represent Jimmy McGill.
00:27:12.047,00:27:14.925,"Hey. All right, now, he fired the first shot, okay?"
00:27:14.925,00:27:19.597,"Trying to keep me from using my name? My own name, Kim?"
00:27:19.597,00:27:21.723,I get that.
00:27:21.723,00:27:24.143,But this?
00:27:24.143,00:27:26.479,You're better than this.
00:27:26.479,00:27:28.772,"Yes, you are."
00:27:26.479,00:27:30.899,"I'm better than this? I'm bet-- Well, you're better than that schmuck Hamlin."
00:27:30.899,00:27:33.319,"Oh, come on, Jimmy."
00:27:33.319,00:27:36.071,You could be somewhere where they appreciate you.
00:27:36.071,00:27:38.282,Where they see how valuable you are.
00:27:38.282,00:27:40.534,"Where, I don't know, maybe they care about you."
00:27:50.794,00:27:53.213,"Forget it, okay?"
00:27:53.213,00:27:56.674,"If Hamlin wants to come after me, he knows where I am."
00:27:56.674,00:28:00.095,I'll be ready. Guns blazing.
00:28:18.531,00:28:21.408,The cease and desist is just the beginning.
00:28:21.408,00:28:25.287,The next step is an injunction.
00:28:53.607,00:29:00.698,"Your Honor, I'm a humble solo practitioner merely trying to ply my trade in an aggressive and evolving marketplace."
00:29:00.698,00:29:03.867,"As I've argued repeatedly, this is trademark infringement."
00:29:03.867,00:29:06.786,Mr. McGill's new logo is an absolute copy of ours.
00:29:06.786,00:29:10.040,I think it falls firmly under fair use.
00:29:10.040,00:29:11.917,Fair use?
00:29:10.040,00:29:13.627,"You're clearly profiting, so fair use doesn't apply."
00:29:13.627,00:29:16.046,There are only so many fonts out there.
00:29:16.046,00:29:18.215,Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?
00:29:18.215,00:29:23.136,No. But we've been using this particular font for 12 years now.
00:29:20.175,00:29:28.183,"And it, in concert with our tri-rectangle graphic and Hamlindigo blue, constitutes a trademark-brand identifier."
00:29:28.183,00:29:32.312,"Whoa, back up."
00:29:32.312,00:29:34.565,Yes. That is our trademark name.
00:29:34.565,00:29:39.069,"Holy crap, you seriously named a color Hamlindigo?"
00:29:39.069,00:29:40.613,That is...
00:29:40.613,00:29:42.531,Yikes.
00:29:42.531,00:29:47.620,"From the man dressed exactly like me. Your Honor, I feel like I'm in the mirror routine with Groucho Marx."
00:29:47.620,00:29:50.205,Like we should be standing waving our arms.
00:29:50.205,00:29:52.541,Really?
00:29:52.541,00:29:58.088,"In addition, the name McGill appears in both logos, which Mr. McGill is hoping to further confuse potential clients."
00:29:58.088,00:30:00.507,So I can't advertise under my own name now?
00:30:00.507,00:30:04.844,I'm to be penalized because I happen to share a name with one of HHM's partners?
00:30:04.844,00:30:07.389,You can't take my name from me.
00:30:07.389,00:30:09.808,"The name is not the problem here, Mr. McGill."
00:30:09.808,00:30:12.227,"Uh, Mr. Hamlin certainly seems to think so."
00:30:12.227,00:30:17.691,"I mean, he wants me to change my name, because he claims that, what, it's some kind of threat to his business?"
00:30:17.691,00:30:19.818,Your Honor-- This is restraint of trade.
00:30:19.818,00:30:21.945,"Okay, whatever happened to the free market, huh?"
00:30:21.945,00:30:25.991,"No, Hamlin wants you to tell-- Okay, enough, Mr. McGill."
00:30:25.991,00:30:28.201,I've heard enough.
00:30:28.201,00:30:32.205,"All right, yes, you are within your rights to advertise using your own name."
00:30:32.205,00:30:40.088,"However, in my estimation, the billboard clearly and intentionally duplicates elements of the Hamlin Hamlin McGill logo."
00:30:40.088,00:30:44.426,You're actively copying their established brand for your own gain.
00:30:44.426,00:30:46.011,I don't see any other explanation.
00:30:46.011,00:30:47.638,Your Honor-- Jimmy. Jimmy.
00:30:47.638,00:30:49.139,Wise up.
00:30:49.139,00:30:52.392,The billboard must come down within 48 hours.
00:30:54.478,00:30:57.356,This is a classic David-versus-Goliath story.
00:30:57.356,00:31:01.568,"I mean, you got your gigantic law firm stomping all over the little guy."
00:31:01.568,00:31:04.655,"Yeah, but it's investigative journalism at its best."
00:31:04.655,00:31:07.157,It's right up your alley.
00:31:07.157,00:31:08.450,Uh-huh.
00:31:10.118,00:31:14.707,"Yeah, okay. Well, let me give you my cell just in case."
00:31:14.707,00:31:17.000,Yeah. Thank you.
00:31:26.385,00:31:29.179,"Can I get the news desk, please? I got a hot tip."
00:31:29.179,00:31:31.724,Wanna be the station that brought down big law?
00:31:31.724,00:31:34.727,You could be like the reporters that brought down big tobacco.
00:31:34.727,00:31:37.103,"Look, I'm talking Woodward and Bernstein here."
00:31:37.103,00:31:41.608,"Hey, your exposé on predatory ATM fees, that was-- Wow."
00:31:41.608,00:31:43.276,"Well, it's a miscarriage of justice."
00:31:43.276,00:31:50.492,"And I think your viewers would be very, very interested and grateful to you for exposing this injustice."
00:31:50.492,00:31:55.205,"I wouldn't characterize this as a community health risk, but it's definitely community interest."
00:31:55.205,00:31:59.668,"No, yes, HHM is a pillar of the community. Yes."
00:31:59.668,00:32:03.672,"No, the war is an important story as well."
00:32:03.672,00:32:05.549,That's why this action is so egregious.
00:32:05.549,00:32:07.551,Sure. Okay.
00:32:07.551,00:32:10.345,"Well, at least consider the human-interest angle here."
00:32:10.345,00:32:17.519,Are you kidding? Lawyer pulls himself up by his bootstraps only to be ground under the heel of the old-money mega-firm?
00:32:17.519,00:32:20.731,That's hearts and minds.
00:32:17.519,00:32:25.402,"You-- Hell-- Yeah, I have your number too, so..."
00:32:25.402,00:32:27.821,"Yeah, I see. Okay."
00:33:16.035,00:33:18.163,"Oh, no, no, no, man."
00:33:18.163,00:33:20.582,I signed the form.
00:33:20.582,00:33:25.587,"Fine. May I suggest you widen the frame to include-- The billboard is the story, okay?"
00:33:25.587,00:33:28.465,"I'm also the story, so..."
00:33:28.465,00:33:31.760,Gotta get me in there.
00:33:31.760,00:33:37.140,"No offense to your minutes of experience, but I'd like to see what we got before we do this, okay?"
00:33:37.140,00:33:39.392,Other guy.
00:33:39.392,00:33:41.770,Other guy.
00:33:41.770,00:33:44.648,Go stand where I was standing.
00:33:44.648,00:33:46.024,Shrink down. Shrink down.
00:33:46.024,00:33:48.944,"Yeah, scrunch. Yeah."
00:33:48.944,00:33:52.280,"Okay, widen the frame, get the billboard."
00:33:52.280,00:33:54.867,"Okay, now get me."
00:33:54.867,00:33:56.451,"No, not me."
00:33:56.451,00:33:58.203,Get him. He's me.
00:33:58.203,00:33:59.872,"Yeah, like that."
00:33:59.872,00:34:01.665,Got it?
00:34:01.665,00:34:03.166,Good.
00:34:04.626,00:34:05.878,Okay.
00:34:09.006,00:34:11.424,How do I look?
00:34:11.424,00:34:12.885,"Well, uh..."
00:34:12.885,00:34:15.220,"No, this is my good side."
00:34:16.471,00:34:18.849,Is the billboard in?
00:34:16.471,00:34:21.059,"Yes. Jesus, just-- You said 100 for one hour, not fricking three."
00:34:21.059,00:34:22.769,You clearly have a journalistic impulse.
00:34:22.769,00:34:24.604,You're a go-getter.
00:34:24.604,00:34:26.147,Go get this.
00:34:26.147,00:34:28.734,"All right, count me down."
00:34:28.734,00:34:32.362,"In five, four, three..."
00:34:32.362,00:34:34.447,Gravitas.
00:34:37.826,00:34:39.828,I'm James McGill.
00:34:39.828,00:34:42.414,"Like most Americans, I'm a self-made man."
00:34:42.414,00:34:45.208,I put myself through law school.
00:34:45.208,00:34:50.672,"Working in the courts as a public defender, I represented those with nowhere else to turn."
00:34:50.672,00:34:53.592,I believe in service.
00:34:53.592,00:34:58.137,"But I've also had a dream, a dream that many of us have."
00:34:58.137,00:35:02.559,A dream to own my own business.
00:35:02.559,00:35:07.313,"Well, I scrimped and I saved, and finally I was able to buy one billboard."
00:35:08.523,00:35:13.862,A tiny foray into advertising for my fledgling law firm.
00:35:13.862,00:35:21.995,"I've always been told that America is the land of opportunity, and I believed it, until today. Heh."
00:35:27.876,00:35:30.295,They said that I was hurting their business.
00:35:30.295,00:35:34.800,"They're rich, they're powerful."
00:35:34.800,00:35:37.385,So who do you think the court sided with?
00:35:39.137,00:35:43.934,So now my little billboard comes down.
00:35:43.934,00:35:46.519,Let me tell you something.
00:35:43.934,00:35:52.985,"If they want a fight, they're gonna get a fight, because I'm not giving up-- WORKER: Aah!"
00:35:52.985,00:35:54.778,"Dude, the dude!"
00:35:54.778,00:35:56.071,The worker guy.
00:35:56.071,00:35:57.781,WORKER: Get me out of here!
00:35:57.781,00:35:59.992,Please. Get me down!
00:35:59.992,00:36:01.618,Dude.
00:36:03.202,00:36:05.497,You got a cell?
00:36:05.497,00:36:07.749,WORKER: Please.
00:36:20.512,00:36:22.639,Unh! Unh! Help me!
00:36:29.228,00:36:31.148,I don't think that's very safe!
00:36:31.148,00:36:33.191,You need to be licensed for that!
00:36:33.191,00:36:34.776,WORKER: Help me.
00:36:41.033,00:36:44.786,JIMMY: Not looking down.
00:36:45.912,00:36:47.372,Not looking down.
00:37:08.060,00:37:10.020,Come get me.
00:37:10.937,00:37:12.564,Help!
00:37:17.610,00:37:19.779,Help me.
00:37:22.741,00:37:25.326,"Sir, I'm right here."
00:37:25.326,00:37:27.370,Please.
00:37:33.126,00:37:34.836,Pull me up.
00:37:43.929,00:37:45.764,Pull me up.
00:38:15.627,00:38:16.878,You okay?
00:38:16.878,00:38:19.547,Took you long enough.
00:38:30.100,00:38:38.942,"I was scared, yes. I mean, I'm not really a big fan of heights, let me tell you, but, you know, something inside me said: You have to do this."
00:38:38.942,00:38:42.821,I'm sure our city's first responders would have been here momentarily...
00:38:42.821,00:38:45.406,"Jesus, can you believe this guy?"
00:38:45.406,00:38:47.659,This whole thing was a publicity stunt. It's gotta be.
00:38:47.659,00:38:50.411,That's all anybody wants when they're in trouble.
00:38:50.411,00:38:52.330,I didn't think life was gonna call on me...
00:38:52.330,00:38:54.207,You don't think anyone's gonna buy this?
00:38:54.207,00:38:56.209,"...in an immediate, life-threatening way."
00:38:56.209,00:38:58.419,It's hard to say.
00:38:58.419,00:39:00.297,"You take it as it comes, right?"
00:39:00.297,00:39:03.424,The universe put me in that spot at that moment.
00:39:03.424,00:39:05.218,Who am I to say no?
00:39:05.218,00:39:08.888,"You know, as a lawyer, well, I help people every day."
00:39:08.888,00:39:10.598,Whole thing's a damn stunt.
00:39:10.598,00:39:14.602,"I think my clients know that when they're in trouble, I'm there."
00:39:14.602,00:39:52.640,I'm just a guy who was in the right-- COMPUTERIZED VOICE: You have seven new messages.
00:39:54.809,00:39:59.147,"To listen to your messages, press one."
00:39:59.147,00:40:03.235,First message.
00:40:44.025,00:40:45.818,"Yeah, right."
00:41:18.768,00:41:20.519,You're early.
00:41:20.519,00:41:22.397,Did you--?
00:41:22.397,00:41:23.940,"Hey, big day."
00:41:23.940,00:41:25.942,My phone's ringing off the hook.
00:41:25.942,00:41:28.653,I have three consults before lunchtime.
00:41:28.653,00:41:30.905,Three.
00:41:30.905,00:41:32.907,Yep.
00:41:32.907,00:41:35.701,The worm has turned.
00:41:35.701,00:41:37.203,That's really great.
00:41:37.203,00:41:40.248,So to what do you credit this sudden change?
00:41:40.248,00:41:42.959,"Well, I gotta admit, you were right."
00:41:42.959,00:41:44.543,How so?
00:41:44.543,00:41:49.674,"Well, you told me to keep plugging and do good work and the clients will come."
00:41:49.674,00:41:53.052,"You know, I'll admit, I almost lost faith a couple times."
00:41:53.052,00:41:56.473,But the worm has turned.
00:41:59.809,00:42:04.481,"So, what, you've been getting referrals from your PD clients?"
00:42:04.481,00:42:10.069,"Yeah. You know, you work hard, show you got half a brain and people come knocking, like you said."
00:42:12.238,00:42:16.409,"Oh. So the prosecutors then, referring clients."
00:42:16.409,00:42:20.246,"Yeah. Yep, exactly."
00:42:20.246,00:42:22.374,Was it Bergeron?
00:42:20.246,00:42:24.583,"When I was starting out, she sent me a couple of good ones."
00:42:24.583,00:42:29.381,"Yeah, uh, it was someone on her team, you know."
00:42:29.381,00:42:33.592,"I mean, hey, it just took some elbow grease and clean living."
00:42:33.592,00:42:35.928,People noticed.
00:42:36.971,00:42:39.598,I knew you had it in you.
00:42:40.808,00:42:42.810,I don't see the Journal here.
00:42:44.270,00:42:45.980,Oh. Here you go.
00:42:45.980,00:42:48.900,Albuquerque Journal.
00:42:49.859,00:42:51.486,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:51.486,00:42:53.071,I didn't see it outside.
00:42:53.071,00:42:55.031,It wasn't out there?
00:42:55.031,00:42:56.824,I didn't see it. Heh.
00:42:56.824,00:43:00.203,Maybe they forgot to deliver it.
00:43:00.203,00:43:03.248,"If there's one thing kids love, it's local print journalism."
00:43:03.248,00:43:04.790,I don't know what to tell you.
00:43:04.790,00:43:06.709,You got a ton of reading material there.
00:43:06.709,00:43:08.044,"Look, hey."
00:43:08.044,00:43:10.588,Financial Times.
00:43:10.588,00:43:15.927,"You know, I know Albuquerque is a hub of global intrigue, but you think that'll tide you over?"
00:43:15.927,00:43:19.680,"Fine, but if it's not here tomorrow, I'll need you to call the subscription office."
00:43:19.680,00:43:22.934,"Yeah, will do. Look, I gotta go."
00:43:22.934,00:43:25.603,"Hey, good luck today."
00:43:25.603,00:43:27.688,CHUCK: Keep it up.
00:43:27.688,00:43:30.275,Hard work looks good on you.
00:01:23.375,00:01:25.878,COP 1: Albuquerque police.
00:01:25.878,00:01:27.212,Hello?
00:01:41.518,00:01:43.812,"Could you open the door, please?"
00:01:46.523,00:01:48.025,We know you're in there.
00:01:48.025,00:01:51.695,You're casting a shadow through your peephole.
00:01:51.695,00:01:54.740,All we wanna do is talk.
00:01:54.740,00:01:58.035,"I'd, uh..."
00:01:58.035,00:02:01.789,"COP 2: Sir, come on and open up."
00:02:01.789,00:02:03.498,I have a condition.
00:02:03.498,00:02:07.168,I can't go outside or be exposed to what's out there.
00:02:07.168,00:02:09.630,You were able to steal your neighbor's newspaper.
00:02:09.630,00:02:12.716,I didn't steal it.
00:02:12.716,00:02:14.635,The cover price is 50 cents.
00:02:14.635,00:02:18.013,COP 1: Did your neighbor consent to sell you her paper?
00:02:18.013,00:02:22.768,Uh-- She-- Isn't--?
00:02:24.436,00:02:26.563,Um...
00:02:26.563,00:02:30.609,"Officer, let's talk about something called probable cause."
00:02:30.609,00:02:38.784,"As I'm sure you know, in New Mexico there is a two-part test to determine whether police have an objectively reasonable basis..."
00:02:49.210,00:02:57.136,"CHUCK: --the situation as Mincey v. Arizona pointed out, create an event..."
00:03:06.020,00:03:08.355,"Hey, Tommy, come around here, would you?"
00:03:08.355,00:03:14.444,CHUCK: And that's why the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a coercive order...
00:03:14.444,00:03:16.864,Check this out.
00:03:22.452,00:03:26.999,CHUCK: --requiring an individual to leave his house is seizure.
00:03:26.999,00:03:32.129,And therefore protected under the Fourth Amendment.
00:03:32.129,00:03:34.464,Right?
00:03:34.464,00:03:36.717,COP 2: Whole lot of camp stove fuel.
00:03:36.717,00:03:38.343,Guy sure sounds like a tweaker.
00:03:38.343,00:03:39.845,See what he did to the breaker box?
00:03:39.845,00:03:42.222,"Is he coming out, or are we going in?"
00:03:52.733,00:03:56.319,"COP 1: You got ten seconds to open this door or it's coming down, you hear me?"
00:03:56.319,00:03:58.197,Ugh.
00:03:58.197,00:04:02.283,"Okay, I'll let you in, but you have to leave your electronic devices outside."
00:04:02.283,00:04:05.037,"No phones, no walkie-talkies, no flashlights."
00:04:05.037,00:04:08.331,"Definitely, definitely no Tasers."
00:04:08.331,00:04:10.417,I can't emphasize that enough.
00:04:10.417,00:04:12.878,"Or-- Look, look, I'll give the paper back."
00:04:12.878,00:04:53.543,No-- Yeah?
00:04:53.543,00:04:56.421,James McGill to see Mr. Richard Sypes.
00:04:56.421,00:04:58.465,Ricky.
00:04:58.465,00:05:00.508,Come on in.
00:05:28.287,00:05:32.207,"Uh, this is my assistant's car. Heh."
00:05:32.207,00:05:34.293,My Mercedes is in the shop.
00:05:34.293,00:05:38.297,"Yeah, I ought to give him a raise. You're right."
00:05:41.925,00:05:45.553,"RICKY: Jim, I saw you on the TV."
00:05:45.553,00:05:47.806,And I had me a pair of insights.
00:05:47.806,00:05:52.102,Insight the first: You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.
00:05:52.102,00:05:56.397,And insight the second: You believe in the real America.
00:05:56.397,00:05:59.276,Freedom. Self-sufficiency.
00:05:59.276,00:06:03.155,I do. I-- I really do.
00:06:03.155,00:06:12.580,"When I see a man like you driving that foreign shitbox of a car, Well, see, actually-- it's a sign a good man can't get ahead today."
00:06:12.580,00:06:14.791,"It's a damn travesty, that's what it is."
00:06:15.834,00:06:23.591,"Well, that may be, ahem, Ricky, but, uh, I refuse to consider myself a victim."
00:06:25.135,00:06:34.686,"You know, we are once again at a point in our history where the fly-swatting hand of government is crushing the spirit of entrepreneurship."
00:06:34.686,00:06:38.397,"Taxes, OSHA requirements."
00:06:38.397,00:06:44.029,"The INS poking their big, fat nose into every mother-loving hire."
00:06:44.029,00:06:46.240,It's damned oppressive.
00:06:46.240,00:06:47.866,It's tragic.
00:06:47.866,00:06:50.035,It's un-American.
00:06:53.205,00:06:58.501,"Jim, I think you are just the lawyer I need, because I got me a case."
00:06:58.501,00:07:01.838,Major.
00:07:01.838,00:07:04.549,Are you ready to clear your calendar?
00:07:08.095,00:07:10.680,"Ricky, I'm all ears."
00:07:10.680,00:07:14.809,I want to secede from the United States.
00:07:14.809,00:07:18.313,"Now, I got 1100 acres of property here."
00:07:18.313,00:07:20.941,Self-sustaining with solar power and wells.
00:07:20.941,00:07:29.824,A sovereign state immune to the business-killing regulations of the country in which it geographically lies.
00:07:29.824,00:07:33.412,We are going to be America's Vatican City.
00:07:36.039,00:07:37.498,Ricky...
00:07:38.499,00:07:39.834,I'm your man.
00:07:41.253,00:07:45.590,Yeah. Let's do this.
00:07:45.590,00:07:47.384,Yee-haw!
00:07:47.384,00:07:49.010,Yee-haw!
00:07:49.010,00:07:53.223,"Yee-haw! Ha, ha, ha."
00:07:54.724,00:07:56.476,"Now, it's not gonna be easy, sir."
00:07:56.476,00:07:59.229,The government is gonna fight us tooth and nail.
00:08:00.897,00:08:03.358,I'm talking thousands of man hours.
00:08:03.358,00:08:06.569,"I mean, years of effort."
00:08:07.821,00:08:10.324,Are you ready for that?
00:08:10.324,00:08:11.950,Me?
00:08:11.950,00:08:13.994,I say bring 'em on.
00:08:13.994,00:08:16.204,Let's talk turkey.
00:08:16.204,00:08:17.414,What's your rate?
00:08:21.251,00:08:23.753,Four hundred and fifty an hour.
00:08:26.256,00:08:28.300,To hell with hourly.
00:08:28.300,00:08:30.010,I want you on retainer.
00:08:30.010,00:08:34.306,How about one million even?
00:08:34.306,00:08:39.602,Five hundred up front and 500 when we're done.
00:08:39.602,00:08:43.898,A million? Ahem. That seems...
00:08:43.898,00:08:45.192,fair.
00:08:45.192,00:08:47.527,Would you like that in cash?
00:09:22.479,00:09:23.855,Uh...
00:09:33.407,00:09:34.991,Uh...
00:09:34.991,00:09:39.954,Tax-free and backed by the full faith and credit of the sovereign Sandia Republic.
00:09:41.664,00:09:43.708,"It's, uh..."
00:09:46.420,00:09:48.629,Son...
00:09:48.629,00:09:51.049,you are getting in on the ground floor.
00:09:51.049,00:09:52.633,"Heh, heh, heh."
00:10:11.486,00:10:14.364,"Mr. McGill, hi."
00:10:14.364,00:10:16.116,Roland Jaycox. Roland.
00:10:16.116,00:10:17.825,"Hey, Roland."
00:10:17.825,00:10:21.204,You can call me Jimmy.
00:10:21.204,00:10:23.748,"Please, come on in."
00:10:23.748,00:10:25.625,What was it like climbing that billboard?
00:10:25.625,00:10:28.545,"Must've been pretty scary, huh?"
00:10:28.545,00:10:31.131,"Guy needed help, that's all."
00:10:31.131,00:10:34.259,"You know, if I can do it, anybody could. Heh."
00:10:34.259,00:10:36.553,"Well, my hat is off to you."
00:10:36.553,00:10:38.638,So here we are.
00:10:38.638,00:10:40.432,And patent law is something you--?
00:10:40.432,00:10:43.560,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:40.432,00:10:46.813,I do so many patent cases I should probably just go ahead and specialize already.
00:10:46.813,00:10:48.398,"So, what do we got?"
00:10:48.398,00:10:50.275,I feel silly asking this.
00:10:50.275,00:10:54.862,"Before I show you my invention, would you mind signing a non-disclosure agreement?"
00:10:54.862,00:10:57.282,You got it.
00:10:58.992,00:11:01.286,It's my idea of a lifetime.
00:11:01.286,00:11:03.746,If Fisher-Price or Playskool got their hands on this...
00:11:03.746,00:11:05.039,No worries.
00:11:13.507,00:11:15.175,You ready?
00:11:22.015,00:11:25.226,I may have seen one of these before.
00:11:25.226,00:11:26.811,Not like this.
00:11:26.811,00:11:28.563,This one has this little unit I've added.
00:11:28.563,00:11:30.524,This is my invention.
00:11:30.524,00:11:32.025,Do you have children?
00:11:32.025,00:11:34.402,"My wife and I have two boys, 4 and 6."
00:11:34.402,00:11:37.656,"And let me tell you, toilet training them, nightmare."
00:11:37.656,00:11:40.908,Both times. They just didn't wanna use the commode.
00:11:40.908,00:11:43.537,So I wired a motion sensor to a voice chip and...
00:11:43.537,00:11:48.458,"Well, no sense getting all technical, but it's all about positive reinforcement."
00:11:48.458,00:11:50.793,Meet Tony the Toilet Buddy.
00:11:50.793,00:11:55.840,"And when you sit down to do your business, this is how he works."
00:12:00.928,00:12:05.225,"TOILET: Oh, yeah. That's the way."
00:12:08.853,00:12:12.815,"Gosh, you're big."
00:12:12.815,00:12:16.319,"My goodness, look at you."
00:12:19.614,00:12:22.492,"Fill me up, Chandler."
00:12:22.492,00:12:24.827,Chandler's my youngest.
00:12:24.827,00:12:26.287,Huh.
00:12:27.706,00:12:31.209,"Give it to me, Chandler."
00:12:31.209,00:12:32.586,Mmm.
00:12:32.586,00:12:34.879,Ah...
00:12:36.506,00:12:39.676,"Anyway, it goes on from there."
00:12:39.676,00:12:42.887,"Yeah. I, uh..."
00:12:44.472,00:12:46.099,Yeah.
00:12:46.099,00:12:48.767,"So, what do you think?"
00:12:50.687,00:12:54.899,It's a little sexual maybe?
00:12:54.899,00:12:57.110,Sexual?
00:12:57.110,00:12:58.695,"Suggestive, maybe?"
00:12:58.695,00:13:01.197,Maybe that's a better word. Heh.
00:13:01.197,00:13:05.159,"Look, I'm not saying this thing won't make you rich. I mean..."
00:13:05.159,00:13:09.956,"Some of your wealthier Pacific Rim nations, they'll love this, the crazy bastards. Heh."
00:13:11.666,00:13:13.960,I created this for children.
00:13:15.712,00:13:20.133,"Hey, Viagra was originally invented to treat hypertension."
00:13:20.133,00:13:22.302,Look how that turned out.
00:13:24.387,00:13:26.765,"You're completely disgusting, you know that?"
00:13:26.765,00:13:28.933,"Hey, buddy, you're the one with the sex toilet."
00:13:28.933,00:13:30.351,Get off my property!
00:13:30.351,00:13:36.608,"Hey, you know what, I hope you do make a fortune, because Chandler's gonna need it to help pay for his therapy."
00:14:10.891,00:14:14.228,STRAUSS: I found the Alpine shepherd boy.
00:14:42.590,00:14:44.925,I'll be right over.
00:15:07.407,00:15:09.033,Oh.
00:15:28.636,00:15:30.304,"Now, where were we?"
00:15:30.304,00:15:31.681,"Oh, would you like some more tea?"
00:15:31.681,00:15:34.392,"No. No, thank you."
00:15:38.688,00:15:40.648,As long as he finishes college.
00:15:40.648,00:15:43.443,"If he drops out, it goes to my niece Raylene."
00:15:43.443,00:15:47.363,"But then Raylene doesn't get the girl-- The girl with the geese, yeah, I know."
00:15:47.363,00:15:50.533,Then that would go to your cousin Helen.
00:15:50.533,00:15:53.536,So long as she never remarries Frederick?
00:15:53.536,00:15:55.121,Exactly.
00:15:55.121,00:16:01.294,"And no matter what, I want the towheaded twins to go to Reverend Laurence's grandson."
00:16:01.294,00:16:04.255,Um... Don't you mean Reverend Haynes?
00:16:04.255,00:16:10.845,"Because Reverend Laurence's grandson is going to get the lute-playing angel, because he was in the choir."
00:16:10.845,00:16:14.014,"Very sharp, Mr. McGill."
00:16:14.014,00:16:17.059,And here I thought all lawyers were idiots.
00:16:17.059,00:16:18.937,"Heh. No, only half of us are idiots."
00:16:22.398,00:16:25.443,Aren't you a spicy one.
00:16:25.443,00:16:29.572,"If I were 40 years younger, I'd have you buy me a piña colada."
00:16:29.572,00:16:33.618,"Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR, I'll bring a blender and some pineapple."
00:16:35.077,00:16:40.124,I knew I'd like you when I saw how you saved that poor man on the television.
00:16:40.124,00:16:41.501,Well...
00:16:41.501,00:16:44.295,Moxie is in such short supply these days.
00:16:44.295,00:16:47.715,"Yeah, well, I pride myself on my moxie."
00:16:47.715,00:16:52.261,"Now, I hate to do this, but I do need to bring up my payment."
00:16:52.261,00:16:56.724,"And I'm sorry, but I can't accept S&amp;H Green Stamps."
00:16:58.601,00:17:02.647,"Now, uh, my fee is $140."
00:17:02.647,00:17:05.399,A hundred and forty.
00:17:06.400,00:17:13.282,I'll gladly accept 70 today and 70 when I come back with the completed documents.
00:17:32.134,00:17:38.224,"Twenty, 40, sixty, 80..."
00:17:39.392,00:17:43.270,a hundred and 20...
00:17:43.270,00:17:45.356,forty.
00:17:46.607,00:17:48.067,Uh...
00:17:48.067,00:17:50.152,Okay. Ahem.
00:17:52.947,00:17:55.199,"Shall we continue, Mr. McGill?"
00:17:58.452,00:18:01.831,"KIM: Put it on the nail, not the skin."
00:18:01.831,00:18:05.001,JIMMY: I can't help it if your toes are too small.
00:18:05.001,00:18:06.669,They should all be the same size.
00:18:06.669,00:18:09.422,The size of the big toe.
00:18:09.422,00:18:12.132,"Yeah, that would be attractive."
00:18:13.384,00:18:15.469,So...
00:18:15.469,00:18:16.971,how's it go again?
00:18:16.971,00:18:21.684,"Oh, you're huge, Chandler."
00:18:21.684,00:18:24.353,"You're a big, big boy."
00:18:24.353,00:18:26.814,"Oh, where does it end?"
00:18:26.814,00:18:29.149,"Oh, don't stop, Chandler."
00:18:29.149,00:18:31.151,Don't stop.
00:18:31.151,00:18:34.072,"Oh, here it comes."
00:18:34.072,00:18:36.574,"Oh, what is that?"
00:18:36.574,00:18:38.952,"No, no. Stop."
00:18:38.952,00:18:40.536,Is that a niblet I see?
00:18:40.536,00:18:42.747,"No. Ha, ha, ha."
00:18:42.747,00:18:45.249,"Hey, good times."
00:18:45.249,00:18:48.628,Even your lousy days are more interesting than my good ones.
00:18:48.628,00:18:52.506,"Yeah, we should definitely do something about that."
00:18:54.425,00:18:57.386,"Seriously, don't ever try to make a living at this."
00:18:57.386,00:18:59.097,Stick with the law.
00:18:59.097,00:19:01.474,Yeah.
00:18:59.097,00:19:04.351,Because I'm really lighting the world on fire in that department.
00:19:04.351,00:19:06.687,Did two wills today.
00:19:06.687,00:19:09.607,"Two wills, and I started a living trust."
00:19:09.607,00:19:11.484,Whoopee.
00:19:11.484,00:19:13.820,Maybe you got a future in elder law.
00:19:13.820,00:19:15.696,You think I could handle all that glamour?
00:19:15.696,00:19:17.865,"No, I'm serious."
00:19:17.865,00:19:20.660,I've thought about getting into elder law myself.
00:19:20.660,00:19:23.121,I watched my grandmother at the end.
00:19:23.121,00:19:24.998,It's...
00:19:24.998,00:19:27.416,It's awful what people have to deal with.
00:19:27.416,00:19:29.585,Insurance companies.
00:19:29.585,00:19:33.297,My scumbag cousin stealing her savings and her pain meds.
00:19:34.465,00:19:36.258,Getting old sucks.
00:19:36.258,00:19:39.971,Seniors need someone on their side.
00:19:46.019,00:19:48.896,It's Howard.
00:19:49.939,00:19:51.565,Shh.
00:19:52.817,00:19:54.234,"Hi, Howard."
00:19:55.569,00:19:59.281,"No. I mean, I haven't, uh..."
00:19:59.281,00:20:01.117,"Oh, my God, when?"
00:20:02.827,00:20:07.832,"Yeah, okay. I'll see if I can track Jimmy down."
00:20:07.832,00:20:10.376,I'll call you back.
00:20:14.005,00:20:15.506,It's Chuck.
00:20:25.307,00:20:28.477,"JIMMY: Chuck. Chuck, you with me?"
00:20:28.477,00:20:30.354,"Chuck, hey, buddy, it's me."
00:20:30.354,00:20:33.607,"Hey, can you talk to me?"
00:20:33.607,00:20:36.819,Crazy sons of bitches.
00:20:36.819,00:20:41.448,"Hey, sir. You can't do that."
00:20:41.448,00:20:43.659,"JIMMY: No, no. No electricity, you understand?"
00:20:43.659,00:20:46.162,"NURSE: No, it needs to be on."
00:20:46.162,00:20:48.915,"KIM: No, wait, wait. Wait, wait."
00:20:48.915,00:20:51.000,JIMMY: Why isn't that one going out?
00:20:51.000,00:20:52.919,Damn it.
00:20:52.919,00:20:54.670,"I just-- Jimmy, wait a second."
00:20:54.670,00:20:57.173,"Jimmy, think."
00:20:57.173,00:20:59.425,"WOMAN: Sir, sir?"
00:20:59.425,00:21:01.135,"Sir, I need you to get down."
00:21:01.135,00:21:03.512,JIMMY: What kind of torture chamber you running here?
00:21:03.512,00:21:06.640,He's allergic to electricity.
00:21:06.640,00:21:10.394,"All these lights, you might as well throw him into a microwave."
00:21:10.394,00:21:12.438,Don't touch me.
00:21:12.438,00:21:13.773,"Please, listen to him."
00:21:17.317,00:21:19.112,"Now, hey."
00:21:19.112,00:21:21.530,"WOMAN: Hold on, hold on a second, Edwin. Sir."
00:21:21.530,00:21:24.242,You ready to calm down?
00:21:21.530,00:21:25.785,"Yes. His name is Jimmy, and, yes, he is gonna calm down."
00:21:25.785,00:21:28.370,"Say the words, Jimmy."
00:21:28.370,00:21:31.707,"I'm calm, okay?"
00:21:31.707,00:21:33.876,"Edwin, why don't you go wait in the hallway?"
00:21:33.876,00:21:36.254,I'll call if we need you.
00:21:37.671,00:21:40.507,"Okay, so tell me about the electricity."
00:21:40.507,00:21:43.886,"Look, I know how it sounds, but it's real."
00:21:43.886,00:21:45.387,"Oh, shit."
00:21:45.387,00:21:48.724,My phone. Stuff.
00:21:48.724,00:21:51.477,He can't have it near him.
00:21:52.812,00:21:55.397,There's my phone.
00:21:56.565,00:21:58.484,Thanks.
00:22:02.488,00:22:05.616,Okay. What the hell happened?
00:22:05.616,00:22:08.911,It started when Charles stole his neighbor's newspaper.
00:22:08.911,00:22:10.663,What? He never leaves the house.
00:22:10.663,00:22:12.372,WOMAN: I don't have all the details.
00:22:12.372,00:22:14.750,but the police found him in a very agitated state.
00:22:14.750,00:22:17.795,He was confrontational and incoherent.
00:22:17.795,00:22:19.130,How come you didn't call me?
00:22:19.130,00:22:23.884,Why did I have to hear about this through my brother's prick of a law partner?
00:22:23.884,00:22:27.596,The only contact information we could find was a business card.
00:22:27.596,00:22:34.394,"Jimmy, in my opinion, Charles should be committed for 30 days of psychiatric observation."
00:22:34.394,00:22:39.233,"As a family member, you can submit a petition for him to be evaluated."
00:22:39.233,00:22:41.277,There's an excellent facility in Las Cruces.
00:22:41.277,00:22:45.198,He can be there tomorrow.
00:22:45.198,00:22:47.407,I'd rather not.
00:22:47.407,00:22:50.244,"Hey, buddy."
00:22:52.997,00:22:55.791,"Mr. McGill, my name is Dr. Cruz."
00:22:55.791,00:22:57.543,Do you know why you're in the hospital?
00:22:57.543,00:23:01.297,The police kicked in my door.
00:23:01.297,00:23:03.090,No cause.
00:23:03.090,00:23:06.093,I wasn't incoherent.
00:23:06.093,00:23:08.386,"They Tasered me, Jimmy."
00:23:08.386,00:23:09.930,"Oh, Jesus."
00:23:11.057,00:23:12.350,Kim?
00:23:12.350,00:23:13.809,"I'm sorry, I can give you privacy."
00:23:13.809,00:23:16.812,"No, no, no, that's all right. Stay."
00:23:16.812,00:23:20.191,Howard called me.
00:23:20.191,00:23:23.152,"How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?"
00:23:23.152,00:23:30.117,Do--? Do you have a phone or a pager or anything with a battery?
00:23:34.372,00:23:36.790,Yeah. Heh.
00:23:36.790,00:23:38.625,Oversight.
00:23:40.794,00:23:44.548,Can you tell me a little more about your...
00:23:44.548,00:23:46.717,situation?
00:23:46.717,00:23:48.677,It's a condition.
00:23:48.677,00:23:51.138,Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.
00:23:51.138,00:23:57.853,"For reasons unknown, my nervous system has become sensitized to certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation."
00:23:57.853,00:24:00.564,Your brother called it an allergy to electricity.
00:24:00.564,00:24:02.566,"Well, it's an oversimplification."
00:24:02.566,00:24:05.194,But it's essentially correct.
00:24:05.194,00:24:11.367,Electronic devices create their own electromagnetic fields.
00:24:11.367,00:24:16.872,"The closer I am to such devices, the worse my symptoms."
00:24:16.872,00:24:31.637,"Burning sensation on my skin, a sharp, cold pain in my bones, muscle fatigue, heart palpitations, blurred vision, tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath."
00:24:31.637,00:24:33.431,A general-- It hurts.
00:24:33.431,00:24:35.099,"Yes, it hurts."
00:24:35.099,00:24:37.977,When did you first experience these symptoms?
00:24:37.977,00:24:40.104,"Oh, must have been..."
00:24:40.104,00:24:43.149,You left the office 18 months ago.
00:24:43.149,00:24:47.153,"Well, in that case, uh, must have been almost two years."
00:24:47.153,00:24:49.322,Two years?
00:24:47.153,00:24:51.949,That's a-- That's a long time to live with discomfort.
00:24:51.949,00:24:54.827,"Well, there it is."
00:24:54.827,00:24:57.288,You think I'm crazy.
00:24:57.288,00:24:58.789,I never said that.
00:24:58.789,00:25:01.499,"No, you didn't, because you're very polite."
00:25:01.499,00:25:03.043,But you think it.
00:25:03.043,00:25:05.712,Otherwise you wouldn't be talking about commitment.
00:25:05.712,00:25:08.882,You find that idea distressing?
00:25:08.882,00:25:15.389,I find it inappropriate for a person suffering from a physical condition.
00:25:17.057,00:25:22.438,Anyone who's spent more than a few minutes with me knows that this isn't some kind of delusion.
00:25:22.438,00:25:23.981,"Wouldn't you agree, Kim?"
00:25:23.981,00:25:27.443,JIMMY: Of course she does.
00:25:27.443,00:25:29.611,You've known me for a decade.
00:25:29.611,00:25:34.532,"Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign, any sign whatsoever, of mental illness?"
00:25:34.532,00:25:40.289,"See? If I thought for one second you could cure me, believe me, I'd jump at the chance."
00:25:40.289,00:25:43.250,"With all due respect, psychiatry doesn't have the answers."
00:25:43.250,00:25:44.877,I'd very much like to try.
00:25:44.877,00:25:48.714,"Section 43-1-11, part E3."
00:25:48.714,00:25:57.181,The proposed commitment is consistent with the treatment needs of the client and with the least drastic means principle.
00:25:57.181,00:26:01.810,Do you think subjecting me to this kind of pain for a month is the least drastic means?
00:26:01.810,00:26:05.731,JIMMY: He might as well spend a month in a wood chipper.
00:26:05.731,00:26:08.734,CRUZ: I understand your frustration.
00:26:08.734,00:26:17.284,I do. You're obviously a highly-intelligent man in difficult circumstances.
00:26:17.284,00:26:20.578,May I ask you a question?
00:26:20.578,00:26:22.415,Yeah.
00:26:20.578,00:26:23.999,How do you meet the needs of daily life?
00:26:23.999,00:26:25.625,What do you do for light?
00:26:25.625,00:26:29.338,How do you prepare food?
00:26:29.338,00:26:31.631,"For cooking, I have a camp stove."
00:26:31.631,00:26:35.219,I have a large cooler I keep filled with ice.
00:26:35.219,00:26:38.305,"It's not ideal, but I make do."
00:26:38.305,00:26:39.639,CRUZ: I see.
00:26:39.639,00:26:41.934,"Well, thank you."
00:26:41.934,00:26:46.188,Would you mind if I took a moment to speak with your brother?
00:26:46.188,00:26:49.775,"Uh, make sure you still have your wallet when you're done. Heh."
00:26:49.775,00:26:51.444,JIMMY: Funny guy.
00:26:51.444,00:26:52.986,Jimmy.
00:26:56.532,00:26:58.284,I wanna go home.
00:27:06.917,00:27:08.419,That was a dirty trick.
00:27:08.419,00:27:10.796,That wasn't a trick.
00:27:10.796,00:27:13.340,This allergy to electricity isn't real.
00:27:13.340,00:27:15.468,It's a manifestation of something deeper.
00:27:15.468,00:27:21.432,"I'm not saying it's 100 percent real, but Chuck is smarter than you and me put together, so we're not talking him out of this."
00:27:24.143,00:27:26.228,No one is talking about rubber rooms.
00:27:26.228,00:27:28.855,There are specialists-- He's seen specialists.
00:27:28.855,00:27:31.567,The best doctors.
00:27:31.567,00:27:33.110,So you're ready to give up?
00:27:33.110,00:27:34.903,"Who's giving up, huh?"
00:27:34.903,00:27:37.823,I'm-- I'm the one doing the heavy lifting here.
00:27:37.823,00:27:40.951,"That white gas, who do you think brings him that?"
00:27:40.951,00:27:44.746,And milk and bread and toilet paper and ice and every other damn thing he needs.
00:27:44.746,00:27:48.417,Is that helping or enabling?
00:27:48.417,00:27:53.130,"If you testify in a custodial hearing, he can get the help he needs."
00:27:53.130,00:27:56.758,"To be committed involuntarily, he has to be a danger to himself."
00:27:56.758,00:27:58.594,Or others.
00:27:58.594,00:28:01.847,Coleman lanterns indoors?
00:28:01.847,00:28:04.933,"He could burn his house down, or the entire neighborhood."
00:28:04.933,00:28:08.479,And then you're looking at a commitment of 10 to 20 years.
00:28:08.479,00:28:11.731,What if he just hurts himself in a household accident?
00:28:11.731,00:28:13.900,How does he call for help?
00:28:16.195,00:28:18.864,You have the power to help your brother.
00:28:18.864,00:28:21.033,Truly help him.
00:28:23.536,00:28:25.787,Ignoring this won't make it go away.
00:28:30.708,00:28:33.253,What would you do?
00:28:34.338,00:28:38.175,All I know is he needs help.
00:28:47.393,00:28:51.313,Untie him.
00:28:52.939,00:28:55.192,The nurse will bring you the release forms.
00:29:09.331,00:29:11.083,"Oh, boy."
00:29:12.626,00:29:14.294,Jimmy? Kim?
00:29:14.294,00:29:16.922,I thought I'd wait till you got here.
00:29:16.922,00:29:19.966,Great. How's he doing?
00:29:19.966,00:29:22.886,Good.
00:29:22.886,00:29:30.644,"Jimmy, I want you to know that I've talked to the DA, and he absolutely will not sign off on any commitment papers."
00:29:30.644,00:29:32.771,"This is a physical condition, not a mental one."
00:29:32.771,00:29:34.648,Chuck is of sound mind.
00:29:34.648,00:29:37.317,I think we can all agree on that.
00:29:37.317,00:29:39.445,"You're a real peach, Howard."
00:29:39.445,00:29:42.030,Of course you don't want Chuck committed.
00:29:42.030,00:29:44.074,"No, I don't."
00:29:44.074,00:29:47.077,"If Chuck were committed, I'd become his legal guardian."
00:29:47.077,00:29:48.746,And I'd cash him out of HHM.
00:29:48.746,00:29:51.707,"Jesus, Jimmy. Now?"
00:29:51.707,00:29:57.212,"The tanning bed must have melted your brain if you think-- Guys, Chuck, that's why we're here."
00:29:57.212,00:29:59.465,Yes. Let's stay on point.
00:29:59.465,00:30:03.260,We're talking about the well-being of a man whom we all love very much.
00:30:03.260,00:30:04.678,There's many factors at play.
00:30:04.678,00:30:06.346,Spite doesn't have to be one of them.
00:30:06.346,00:30:08.932,Know what? I was on the fence till you showed up.
00:30:08.932,00:30:12.352,Thanks for helping me decide.
00:30:08.932,00:30:14.396,"Wave bye-bye to your cash cow, because it's leaving the pasture."
00:30:14.396,00:30:15.773,I'm committing him.
00:30:20.193,00:30:22.028,Jimmy-- Ji-- Wait.
00:30:22.028,00:30:26.074,"Jimmy, wait. Jimmy-- Jimmy, can you wait?"
00:30:26.074,00:30:29.703,"Jimmy, wait a second. Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help."
00:30:29.703,00:30:33.206,"And maybe it's the right thing to do, but you can't do it like this."
00:30:33.206,00:30:36.710,I just wanna see that son of a bitch sweat.
00:30:36.710,00:30:39.087,It's so obvious what he's afraid of.
00:30:40.088,00:30:42.215,I'm taking my brother home.
00:30:55.020,00:30:56.814,CHUCK: Unh.
00:30:56.814,00:30:59.274,"Yeah, there you go."
00:30:59.274,00:31:02.653,"One and two, and there you go."
00:31:02.653,00:31:04.363,"Hey, you're home."
00:31:04.363,00:31:08.033,All right?
00:31:08.033,00:31:10.285,You want something to eat?
00:31:10.285,00:31:12.830,"Uh, some tea?"
00:31:12.830,00:31:15.332,Coffee.
00:31:15.332,00:31:18.043,Coffee. Coffee it is.
00:31:18.043,00:31:20.462,"Jimmy, I'm gonna need my..."
00:31:21.963,00:31:26.426,"I don't-- I-- I-- Oh, it's..."
00:31:28.011,00:31:29.513,Yeah.
00:32:11.805,00:32:13.265,Wanna talk about this?
00:32:14.391,00:32:16.017,There's nothing to talk about.
00:32:16.017,00:32:20.105,"You took the paper, you saw this, you got sick."
00:32:21.523,00:32:23.316,What's your point?
00:32:23.316,00:32:28.572,"Chuck, I think you got sick because you saw this story."
00:32:28.572,00:32:33.952,"Whenever you think I've done something wrong, something questionable, you get worse."
00:32:33.952,00:32:36.663,I didn't get sick because I read about you in the paper.
00:32:36.663,00:32:45.338,"I got sick because I went out of my house to retrieve the paper-- I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy."
00:32:45.338,00:32:47.215,I've had it too many times.
00:32:47.215,00:32:50.886,"You think this is the return of Slippin' Jimmy, but it's not."
00:32:50.886,00:32:52.304,All right.
00:32:52.304,00:32:55.641,You think the billboard thing was unethical.
00:32:55.641,00:32:59.728,But it was promotion.
00:32:59.728,00:33:05.150,Which wasn't even allowed until five Supreme Court justices went completely bonkers in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona.
00:33:05.150,00:33:08.904,Ah-ha.
00:33:08.904,00:33:10.363,it's legal.
00:33:10.363,00:33:12.365,"If you wanna advertise, that's your business."
00:33:12.365,00:33:17.496,"Business being the operative word, because I have gotten business off of this."
00:33:17.496,00:33:21.583,"Legit business: wills, trusts."
00:33:26.964,00:33:36.765,"Yeah. The things the elderly have to deal with. I mean, relatives coming after their savings, telemarketers, reverse-mortgage scams."
00:33:36.765,00:33:41.561,"Seniors need someone on their side, so you're looking at him."
00:33:42.980,00:33:46.358,"Oh, that sounds promising."
00:33:46.358,00:33:49.068,But it has nothing to do with my condition.
00:33:49.068,00:33:51.822,"Chuck, listen, I'm gonna make you a promise right now."
00:33:51.822,00:33:54.240,"Not necessary, not requested."
00:33:54.240,00:33:56.910,Okay. The billboard was a one-time thing.
00:33:56.910,00:34:00.246,I'm a good lawyer.
00:33:56.910,00:34:02.749,"I just needed some razzmatazz, you know, to get the ball rolling, some showmanship."
00:34:02.749,00:34:05.168,That's all it was.
00:34:05.168,00:34:06.837,All right.
00:34:05.168,00:34:08.755,"From here on out, I'm gonna play by the rules."
00:34:08.755,00:34:11.299,As any lawyer should.
00:34:11.299,00:34:16.972,"There are clients out there who need me, and I'm gonna give them the best representation I know how to provide."
00:34:16.972,00:34:21.226,"I'm on the up-and-up, okay?"
00:34:21.226,00:34:23.729,"Slippin' Jimmy, he's back in Cicero."
00:34:23.729,00:34:25.939,Dead and buried.
00:34:30.276,00:34:31.987,Okay.
00:34:33.947,00:34:35.908,We'll see.
00:34:35.908,00:34:37.826,Where you going?
00:34:37.826,00:34:40.620,CHUCK: Somebody's gotta make that coffee.
00:34:48.503,00:34:53.550,"I'm sure the truth will come out, if indeed that's what we're all interested in."
00:34:53.550,00:35:03.685,"I know everybody in this courtroom has strong feelings about Nicholas Baron's past, but I submit he is not on trial here for his past."
00:35:03.685,00:35:08.941,He is on trial for the murders of Donald Kovack and Eddie Alonzo.
00:35:11.109,00:35:13.528,JIMMY: Single-breasted.
00:35:16.073,00:35:18.157,Light blue or cream.
00:35:18.157,00:35:20.159,It's blue.
00:35:21.661,00:35:23.830,Linen.
00:35:32.547,00:35:35.550,Simple.
00:36:10.585,00:36:11.920,Thank you.
00:36:50.333,00:36:53.503,Hello there.
00:36:53.503,00:36:57.590,How are you this fine morning?
00:36:57.590,00:37:00.301,Very good. Play fair.
00:37:00.301,00:37:04.222,"Oh, what do we got here?"
00:37:04.222,00:37:06.725,a piece is trying to get away there.
00:37:06.725,00:37:08.143,Enjoy the Jell-O.
00:37:08.143,00:37:11.771,Get to the bottom.
00:37:11.771,00:37:14.273,That's the only one I wanna talk to. There he is.
00:37:14.273,00:37:16.068,How are you?
00:37:16.068,00:37:17.777,"Whoa, what a grip, young man."
00:37:17.777,00:37:20.488,"Watch out, that's my will-writing hand."
00:37:20.488,00:37:22.615,"I'm quite strong, you know."
00:37:22.615,00:37:26.619,"Hello, ladies."
00:37:26.619,00:37:28.246,All right over there?
00:37:28.246,00:37:30.832,Very good. Play fair.
00:37:32.042,00:37:34.794,"Wait a second, is that Veronica Lake?"
00:37:34.794,00:37:38.006,"Give me a hug, beautiful."
00:37:38.006,00:37:40.092,Yes. You look great today.
00:37:40.092,00:37:42.677,"All right. No cheating, no hiding the tablet."
00:37:42.677,00:37:45.013,"Oh, what do we have here?"
00:37:53.772,00:37:56.733,"Hey, there he is."
00:37:56.733,00:37:59.027,John Wilkes Booth.
00:37:59.027,00:38:00.987,What you reading there?
00:38:00.987,00:38:04.824,The Complete Annotated Book of Rules for Parking Validation?
00:38:04.824,00:38:06.159,No.
00:38:06.159,00:38:09.495,The rules for parking validation are actually pretty simple.
00:38:09.495,00:38:11.581,Most people get it on the first try.
00:38:13.291,00:38:17.295,"Well, you'll be pleased to know I have the requisite stickers."
00:38:17.295,00:38:19.631,Be still my heart.
00:38:19.631,00:38:21.133,And...
00:38:22.092,00:38:24.427,You can have this as well.
00:38:24.427,00:38:26.679,I'm doing elder law now.
00:38:26.679,00:38:28.473,"Need a will, call McGill."
00:38:28.473,00:38:33.228,"So give me a call if you, uh..."
00:38:33.228,00:38:38.191,"If, uh, you happen to know any elders."
00:38:38.191,00:38:39.525,Good night.
00:38:39.525,00:38:42.445,Couldn't have a bad one if I tried.
00:39:15.895,00:39:17.189,MIKE: Good night.
00:39:17.189,00:39:18.773,MAN: Good night.
00:39:40.628,00:39:42.214,MAN: Have a good one.
00:39:45.800,00:39:48.845,"WOMAN 1: He drove in from El Paso, but he made good time."
00:39:54.226,00:39:56.061,MAN: Pick it up on pancakes.
00:40:11.617,00:40:14.246,WOMAN 2: Eggs over-medium.
00:40:19.918,00:40:21.586,"MAN: Eggs over, pick it up."
00:42:31.632,00:42:33.885,Don't be so silly.
00:42:33.885,00:42:36.304,DAN: There's nobody around.
00:42:36.304,00:42:38.223,DAN: Then I'll come in.
00:42:38.223,00:42:40.933,We're going to be late.
00:42:40.933,00:42:43.436,"LUCY: I'm not bashful, but I've never kissed you before."
00:42:43.436,00:42:45.855,And I don't think this is the place.
00:42:45.855,00:42:50.193,"DAN: Gosh, if you knew how crazy I am about you, you wouldn't hesitate."
00:42:50.193,00:42:51.944,LUCY: Why don't you take some hot milk?
00:42:51.944,00:43:30.442,"I must be in love because I started-- MIKE: Long way from home, aren't you?"
00:43:30.442,00:43:32.985,You and me both.
00:01:30.841,00:01:32.634,WOMAN: Mike.
00:01:35.178,00:01:39.182,Hey.
00:01:39.182,00:01:42.728,Thanks for coming.
00:01:48.817,00:01:51.111,"I'm just parked across the street, so..."
00:01:51.111,00:01:55.282,Okay. I was just gonna hit the...
00:01:55.282,00:01:56.658,"Yeah, sure."
00:01:56.658,00:01:59.661,I'll meet you out front.
00:02:16.511,00:02:18.388,Janitor.
00:02:18.388,00:02:19.723,Anybody here?
00:04:09.875,00:04:11.710,GIRL: Higher.
00:04:11.710,00:04:13.837,"Okay, you asked for it."
00:04:16.090,00:04:19.342,"Oh, sweetheart."
00:04:19.342,00:04:21.261,Pop-pop's getting tired.
00:04:21.261,00:04:22.637,Don't aw me.
00:04:22.637,00:04:26.516,You take a little break.
00:04:26.516,00:04:28.102,Go on.
00:04:33.190,00:04:36.944,A good kid.
00:04:39.529,00:04:41.281,So how do you like it...
00:04:41.281,00:04:44.034,out west?
00:04:44.034,00:04:47.204,I like it.
00:04:47.204,00:04:48.997,Yeah.
00:04:48.997,00:04:52.251,"Different, anyway."
00:04:53.794,00:04:55.087,How you doing?
00:04:55.087,00:04:59.925,"I'm-- Yeah, I'm okay."
00:04:59.925,00:05:01.760,Adjusting.
00:05:03.011,00:05:04.512,And Kaylee?
00:05:05.555,00:05:09.017,"Yeah, she's settling in."
00:05:09.017,00:05:11.979,She still asks about him.
00:05:11.979,00:05:14.856,Where's Daddy?
00:05:14.856,00:05:16.316,She just misses him.
00:05:17.400,00:05:18.944,Yeah.
00:05:21.655,00:05:23.740,"How long you in town for, Mike?"
00:05:23.740,00:05:26.367,I'm here...
00:05:26.367,00:05:30.580,"for the duration, indefinitely. I'm, uh..."
00:05:30.580,00:05:32.666,I'm better.
00:05:32.666,00:05:34.542,And I'm sorry it took me so long.
00:05:34.542,00:05:38.839,But I'm not like I was.
00:05:38.839,00:05:42.968,"And I wanna be here for you, for Kaylee, for my family."
00:05:45.262,00:05:48.223,That's good.
00:05:50.475,00:05:52.144,What?
00:05:53.187,00:05:55.189,"What is it, honey?"
00:05:56.231,00:05:59.442,"Mike, I gotta ask."
00:05:59.442,00:06:05.740,"I know I just need to move on from this, but I keep thinking about something."
00:06:05.740,00:06:08.367,About what?
00:06:08.367,00:06:14.249,"like, for a few weeks there, he was...different."
00:06:14.249,00:06:16.293,Different how?
00:06:17.460,00:06:19.462,"Different, I don't know."
00:06:19.462,00:06:20.797,"Moody, you know?"
00:06:20.797,00:06:24.718,He barely ate.
00:06:24.718,00:06:28.555,He snapped at me about the stupidest things.
00:06:28.555,00:06:32.142,"I started to think something's up at work, or someone's sick, something like that."
00:06:32.142,00:06:35.187,But he wouldn't talk to me.
00:06:35.187,00:06:39.274,"Cops aren't real touchy-feely, you know that."
00:06:39.274,00:06:41.735,No.
00:06:41.735,00:06:43.611,"No, they're not."
00:06:43.611,00:06:48.407,"No, but this wasn't the normal tough guys don't cry crap."
00:06:48.407,00:06:52.120,This was more. I mean...
00:06:52.120,00:06:55.916,"I mean, did you feel anything like that from him?"
00:06:55.916,00:06:58.668,"No. As far as I remember, he seemed okay."
00:06:58.668,00:07:00.545,He seemed okay to me.
00:07:00.545,00:07:07.510,"Well, I started to think, I-- I don't know."
00:07:07.510,00:07:14.142,"But then three days or four, I don't remember, but before he died, there was this phone call."
00:07:14.142,00:07:17.854,"Two-thirty in the morning, I wake up and Matty's not in bed."
00:07:17.854,00:07:20.481,And I hear him.
00:07:26.238,00:07:28.698,He gets intense.
00:07:28.698,00:07:32.994,"Like, he'd be screaming if he wasn't whispering, you know?"
00:07:37.832,00:07:42.337,"But this, I mean, he was angry."
00:07:42.337,00:07:44.547,What was he saying?
00:07:44.547,00:07:47.508,I couldn't make it out.
00:07:48.885,00:07:51.805,I don't know.
00:07:53.014,00:07:54.975,But the next morning I called him out.
00:07:54.975,00:07:57.394,What the hell was that about?
00:07:57.394,00:08:00.021,And he wouldn't talk to me.
00:08:00.021,00:08:02.232,But I think...
00:08:03.483,00:08:06.069,I think he was talking to you.
00:08:07.528,00:08:10.907,Me?
00:08:10.907,00:08:12.284,Huh?
00:08:13.952,00:08:18.248,"For one hot second, I thought maybe he was catting around-- No, he wouldn't do that."
00:08:18.248,00:08:20.583,"No, I know. I know that."
00:08:20.583,00:08:23.711,But you? He knew he could call you anytime he had a problem.
00:08:23.711,00:08:25.755,"You were thick as thieves, the two of you."
00:08:25.755,00:08:27.632,And there was something in his voice.
00:08:27.632,00:08:31.011,It was how he was talking.
00:08:31.011,00:08:33.513,It makes me think it was you.
00:08:33.513,00:08:36.350,"Stace, I don't think it was."
00:08:36.350,00:08:39.353,I can't recall any late-night heart-to-hearts with him.
00:08:39.353,00:08:41.021,Not around then.
00:08:41.021,00:08:45.108,"Maybe it was a CI, or a case."
00:08:47.235,00:08:50.280,I know what you're doing.
00:08:50.280,00:08:55.369,"Thinking, If I'd noticed this, or changed that, maybe I could've done something."
00:08:55.369,00:08:58.621,You don't think I haven't had those thoughts? I do.
00:08:59.998,00:09:02.625,Every day.
00:09:02.625,00:09:05.586,You gotta quit beating yourself up like this.
00:09:08.631,00:09:11.510,Matty's gone.
00:09:11.510,00:09:14.637,And that's really all there is to it.
00:09:19.809,00:09:21.811,Yeah.
00:09:23.730,00:09:26.191,I guess that's that.
00:09:30.487,00:09:34.408,"It's getting on, I gotta get Kaylee her dinner."
00:09:35.409,00:09:38.119,Put her to bed.
00:09:38.119,00:09:39.662,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:42.040,00:09:43.875,Okay. Ahem.
00:09:45.502,00:09:52.259,"Well, if you want me to drop by and keep an eye on her, I wanna help."
00:10:02.185,00:10:04.187,See you around.
00:10:37.304,00:10:40.098,MAN: Where to?
00:10:40.098,00:10:42.559,MIKE: Francisco.
00:10:42.559,00:10:43.935,FRANCISCO: Yeah.
00:10:43.935,00:10:46.646,MIKE: You know this town?
00:10:46.646,00:10:48.231,How well?
00:10:50.525,00:10:54.154,MAN: You sew this up yourself?
00:10:54.154,00:10:56.281,Not bad.
00:10:56.281,00:10:57.991,Bet there's a story there.
00:10:57.991,00:11:00.827,Isn't there always?
00:11:00.827,00:11:04.122,"All right, a little sting here."
00:11:04.122,00:11:08.627,Okay.
00:11:08.627,00:11:12.172,"Now, you're gonna wanna take it easy."
00:11:12.172,00:11:14.299,Keep it clean.
00:11:14.299,00:11:17.385,Keep it dry.
00:11:17.385,00:11:20.013,There's a Walgreens couple blocks over on Louisiana.
00:11:20.013,00:11:22.265,Maybe go get yourself a sling.
00:11:22.265,00:11:25.393,You don't have one?
00:11:25.393,00:11:28.062,Got a cone you could put around your neck.
00:11:28.062,00:11:31.608,"It's about the same, right?"
00:11:31.608,00:11:35.278,So it's gonna be 500?
00:11:35.278,00:11:40.492,"I can, uh, throw some pills in for the pain."
00:11:40.492,00:11:42.327,This stuff's essentially Vicodin.
00:11:42.327,00:11:45.205,I can give it to you for 25 a pill.
00:11:45.205,00:11:49.543,Maybe drop the price to 15 for something a little less human-centric.
00:11:49.543,00:11:52.587,I'm an aspirin man.
00:11:52.587,00:11:56.508,Tell you what.
00:11:56.508,00:11:58.885,In case you change your mind.
00:12:01.137,00:12:02.472,You new in town?
00:12:05.225,00:12:07.227,Passing through or sticking around?
00:12:07.227,00:12:09.479,Why?
00:12:09.479,00:12:11.439,No reason.
00:12:11.439,00:12:18.863,"It's just if you're relocating to the land of enchantment, I know people."
00:12:18.863,00:12:20.532,I could get you some work.
00:12:20.532,00:12:24.035,I am not looking for that kind of work.
00:12:24.035,00:12:26.538,But...
00:12:28.081,00:12:29.624,...thanks.
00:12:32.711,00:12:34.837,Don't know why it has to be this way.
00:12:34.837,00:12:38.132,Could've been friendly.
00:12:38.132,00:12:40.510,You really want the formal treatment?
00:12:40.510,00:12:42.262,Lawyer.
00:12:42.262,00:12:44.138,"Come on, Mike."
00:12:44.138,00:12:48.560,It's just a couple of questions.
00:12:48.560,00:12:50.353,Lawyer.
00:12:50.353,00:12:52.230,You're not under arrest.
00:12:52.230,00:12:55.609,Did anybody here say arrest?
00:12:55.609,00:12:59.195,"But I gotta say, I expected more cooperation from you on this."
00:12:59.195,00:13:00.779,Cop to cop.
00:13:02.616,00:13:04.659,Lawyer.
00:13:12.208,00:13:15.794,Fine.
00:13:23.970,00:13:26.723,"Ehrmantraut, who's got him and where?"
00:13:26.723,00:13:28.349,That way.
00:13:29.434,00:13:31.227,"Hey, fellas, how you doing?"
00:13:31.227,00:13:34.522,James McGill.
00:13:35.732,00:13:38.067,What?
00:13:38.067,00:13:42.821,"No, I look like a young Paul Newman dressed as Matlock."
00:13:42.821,00:13:44.365,Where's my guy?
00:13:47.994,00:13:49.454,Say hello to Barney Fife.
00:13:49.454,00:13:51.956,"Wrong show, but thanks for playing."
00:13:56.085,00:13:57.420,"So, what happened?"
00:13:57.420,00:14:00.047,Mayor didn't give you enough stickers?
00:14:02.091,00:14:04.427,You wanna tell me what we're doing here?
00:14:04.427,00:14:06.304,"Oh, here's your coffee."
00:14:06.304,00:14:07.681,Uh...
00:14:07.681,00:14:11.601,"Hope it's good to the last drop, because I'm billing you the full hour for it."
00:14:11.601,00:14:13.227,That's for you.
00:14:13.227,00:14:15.689,"Oh, that's very thoughtful."
00:14:17.607,00:14:20.694,You serious? Why'd you have me bring it to you?
00:14:20.694,00:14:25.072,"All right, here's what's gonna happen: Those two cops out there are from Philadelphia."
00:14:25.072,00:14:26.949,They've gone a long way to see me.
00:14:26.949,00:14:29.703,"When they come in here, we're all gonna have a little chat."
00:14:29.703,00:14:40.338,"When it's over, the young one, who's been writing in his little notebook, he's gonna take it and put it in his jacket, and when he does that, I want you to take that coffee and spill it on him."
00:14:40.338,00:14:42.632,"Little accident, that's all."
00:14:42.632,00:14:45.259,"And why, pray tell, would I do that?"
00:14:45.259,00:14:48.262,Because I'm asking you to. It's the only reason you're here.
00:14:48.262,00:14:51.015,So I'm here because you want me to assault a police officer?
00:14:51.015,00:14:56.646,I am asking you to take a few ounces of lukewarm coffee and spill it on him.
00:14:56.646,00:14:59.940,I doubt that satisfies the definition of assault.
00:14:59.940,00:15:02.985,"But, hey, you're the lawyer."
00:15:02.985,00:15:05.655,"Right, how silly of me."
00:15:05.655,00:15:11.703,"All you want is for me to aid and abet you ripping off that guy's notepad, because that's what you're doing here, right? Huh?"
00:15:11.703,00:15:14.497,"What, are you nuts?"
00:15:14.497,00:15:17.709,"Hey, I hate to remind you of this, but you owe me one."
00:15:20.336,00:15:22.004,One good turn and so forth.
00:15:22.004,00:15:24.924,You want a good turn?
00:15:24.924,00:15:30.137,"I'm gonna behave like an honest-to-God, law-abiding, licensed attorney."
00:15:30.137,00:15:33.307,'Cause clearly you need one with whatever the hell is going on here.
00:15:33.307,00:15:37.937,"Those two jokers out in the hallway, I'm gonna make sure they dot their I's and cross their T's."
00:15:37.937,00:15:39.689,Everything square and aboveboard.
00:15:39.689,00:15:43.693,"That's what I'm gonna do, and you're gonna be happy as hell that I'm here."
00:15:43.693,00:15:48.030,But this little Juan Valdez bump-and-dump? No.
00:15:48.030,00:15:49.741,Not gonna happen.
00:15:51.200,00:15:54.913,"Hey, gentlemen, we're prepared to indulge you."
00:15:56.831,00:16:00.710,MAN: Detective Escalaire will be sitting in with us as per A.P.D. policy.
00:16:00.710,00:16:04.046,"Okay with you, right?"
00:16:04.046,00:16:05.632,Okay.
00:16:05.632,00:16:09.260,"You got your lawyer, Mike."
00:16:09.260,00:16:11.345,Great.
00:16:09.260,00:16:13.807,"So like we said, we're here looking into this Hoffman and Fensky thing."
00:16:13.807,00:16:16.309,"Yeah, whatever you can tell us."
00:16:16.309,00:16:18.311,"Uh, hold on, hold on."
00:16:18.311,00:16:22.440,"Hoffman, Fensky."
00:16:22.440,00:16:25.985,"Assume I know absolutely nothing about my client here, all right?"
00:16:25.985,00:16:28.279,Start at the beginning.
00:16:28.279,00:16:34.494,"Look, don't let Mr. Ehrmantraut's dancing eyes and bubbly bon vivant personality fool you."
00:16:34.494,00:16:37.997,"He's actually, believe it or not, somewhat taciturn."
00:16:37.997,00:16:41.626,Shall I fan you gently so you don't go into shock?
00:16:41.626,00:16:45.421,"Start at the beginning, okay?"
00:16:45.421,00:16:47.173,"Okay, Mr. McGill."
00:16:47.173,00:16:54.472,"As you probably gathered, we, Detective Sanders and I, work for the Philadelphia Police Department, as did Mr. Ehrmantraut for nearly 30 years."
00:16:54.472,00:16:57.350,Philadelphia?
00:16:57.350,00:17:01.228,"Mr. Ehrmantraut had a son, Matt, he too was with Philly P.D."
00:17:01.228,00:17:04.106,He was a rookie officer with about two years on the job.
00:17:04.106,00:17:06.734,He was a good cop.
00:17:06.734,00:17:12.448,"About nine months ago, he responded to a shots-fired call in some west-side rattrap."
00:17:12.448,00:17:14.993,"Matt went in with his partner, Officer Troy Hoffman."
00:17:14.993,00:17:17.996,They had Sergeant Jack Fensky backing them up.
00:17:17.996,00:17:20.498,"Unfortunately, things got out of hand."
00:17:20.498,00:17:24.084,"The three of them were ambushed, and, uh, Matt didn't make it out."
00:17:24.084,00:17:27.463,"Now, Hoffman and Fensky returned fire, but the shooter got away."
00:17:27.463,00:17:31.592,"We chased a few leads, shook up the usual suspects, came up short."
00:17:33.553,00:17:36.430,I'm very sorry to hear it.
00:17:36.430,00:17:41.477,"Anyways, we kept beating the bushes, kept coming up dry, until three months ago."
00:17:41.477,00:17:45.398,That's when Hoffman and Fensky turned up dead in a vacant lot out in Nicetown.
00:17:45.398,00:17:48.275,"Again, an ambush of some kind, it looks like."
00:17:55.366,00:17:57.577,Some bad business.
00:17:57.577,00:17:59.037,And maybe that got Matt killed.
00:17:59.037,00:18:01.330,"Yeah, sorry, I gotta do my lawyer thing here."
00:18:01.330,00:18:04.291,"Uh, what does my client have to do with any of this?"
00:18:04.291,00:18:07.336,"Uh, Mike, this is a Hail Mary."
00:18:07.336,00:18:08.755,Beyond that.
00:18:08.755,00:18:13.092,"I mean, if we had any hard evidence or leads, we wouldn't be out here."
00:18:13.092,00:18:16.930,Is there anything you can tell us about what Hoffman and Fensky were into?
00:18:16.930,00:18:18.347,"Yeah, help us out, Mike."
00:18:18.347,00:18:20.391,Help us catch the bastard who killed Matty.
00:18:23.937,00:18:26.397,I don't know much about Hoffman and Fensky.
00:18:26.397,00:18:29.776,They were Matt's people.
00:18:29.776,00:18:32.070,I saw 'em in a bar the night they died.
00:18:32.070,00:18:34.739,"It was McClure's, maybe The Red Dog."
00:18:34.739,00:18:37.324,Probably McClure's.
00:18:37.324,00:18:39.201,Were they drinking with anyone?
00:18:39.201,00:18:41.495,It's a cop bar. They were drinking with everyone.
00:18:41.495,00:18:43.664,MAN: You see them with anyone in particular?
00:18:43.664,00:18:45.666,I couldn't tell you.
00:18:46.667,00:18:48.294,You know how I was.
00:18:48.294,00:18:50.337,How you doing these days?
00:18:50.337,00:18:55.551,MIKE: Feeling like I crawled out from the bottom of a bottle and working hard to stay there.
00:18:55.551,00:19:00.890,"Although, I've gotta say, it doesn't help much dredging up the past like this."
00:19:02.058,00:19:06.020,"Let me ask you, when did you come out here to Albuquerque?"
00:19:06.020,00:19:08.731,"It couldn't have been, uh, too much later."
00:19:08.731,00:19:10.483,I think it was the very next day.
00:19:10.483,00:19:15.071,"Yeah? The day after Hoffman and Fensky died, huh?"
00:19:15.071,00:19:18.532,"You didn't think to, uh, stick around once you heard the news?"
00:19:18.532,00:19:21.410,I don't think I heard the news till I was west of Kansas City.
00:19:21.410,00:19:24.455,"Still, you, uh, didn't come back for the funerals, correct?"
00:19:24.455,00:19:27.333,Even though Hoffman was Matt's partner.
00:19:27.333,00:19:30.461,SANDERS: You remember anything about that night at the bar?
00:19:30.461,00:19:32.797,Did you talk to Hoffman or Fensky at all?
00:19:32.797,00:19:37.051,"Sorry, I got nothing."
00:19:37.051,00:19:40.721,I'm sorry you guys took a flyer on me. I wish it had paid off.
00:19:40.721,00:19:43.975,That it? We done here?
00:19:43.975,00:19:46.144,"We're done here, yeah."
00:19:46.144,00:19:48.146,"That wasn't so hard, huh?"
00:19:48.146,00:19:49.939,"Thanks, Mike."
00:19:49.939,00:19:56.278,"We're probably gonna kick around for another couple days, in case you think of something."
00:19:57.822,00:20:01.034,"Oh, hey-- Oh! Shit."
00:20:01.034,00:20:02.535,Jeez. Sorry. Sorry.
00:20:02.535,00:20:03.786,Got any paper towels?
00:20:03.786,00:20:07.123,"Hey, I got it. Thank you."
00:20:26.559,00:20:32.398,"Oh, for the love of-- You gotta do that right here?"
00:20:32.398,00:20:37.319,What's so important in there that we had to pull that third-rate Marx Brothers routine?
00:20:37.319,00:20:39.363,You really wanna know?
00:20:39.363,00:20:41.699,And risk getting a piece of an obstruction rap?
00:20:41.699,00:20:43.993,"No, thank you."
00:20:43.993,00:20:46.746,Anything else you wanna ask?
00:20:48.789,00:20:50.750,How'd you know?
00:20:50.750,00:20:53.627,Know what?
00:20:53.627,00:21:02.511,"That I would do that. That-- Ahem. How did you know that I would, uh, spill that coffee?"
00:21:04.889,00:21:06.390,What the hell is that?
00:21:06.390,00:21:10.019,"What's heh-heh supposed to mean, huh?"
00:21:11.938,00:21:15.441,"Okay, great, you're the strong, silent type. Hooray for you."
00:21:15.441,00:21:21.321,"But in case you missed it, your friends from Philly back there, they think you killed two cops."
00:21:23.241,00:21:24.742,Yup.
00:22:20.881,00:22:23.009,"Yeah, it's me."
00:22:23.009,00:22:24.802,We need to talk.
00:22:31.600,00:22:33.978,You call the cops?
00:22:33.978,00:22:35.521,What?
00:22:35.521,00:22:36.730,Did you call 'em?
00:22:36.730,00:22:38.816,"Yeah, I did."
00:22:38.816,00:22:42.862,"I told them I heard about Hoffman and Fensky-- Yeah, what?"
00:22:42.862,00:22:44.738,You don't think it's strange?
00:22:44.738,00:22:49.035,"First Matt, then not six months later, his partner and his sergeant?"
00:22:49.035,00:22:51.787,"Yeah, I called them, to help catch Matty's killer."
00:22:51.787,00:22:54.040,"Mike, what if the same person--?"
00:22:54.040,00:22:56.334,What if the piece of shit who got Matty got them too?
00:22:56.334,00:22:59.086,And what exactly did you tell them?
00:22:59.086,00:23:01.255,I told them-- You tell 'em Matt was dirty?
00:23:01.255,00:23:03.049,Is that what you told them?
00:23:01.255,00:23:04.633,I-- How could you possibly think that?
00:23:04.633,00:23:06.844,"That's your husband, the father of your child."
00:23:06.844,00:23:10.097,I didn't say that.
00:23:10.097,00:23:14.894,"After Kaylee and I moved here, when I was unpacking, it was in the lining of an old suitcase."
00:23:14.894,00:23:18.064,"Matt must have tucked it away in there, because this was cash."
00:23:18.064,00:23:21.734,"Five, six thousand, from God knows where."
00:23:21.734,00:23:23.819,"I mean, we were basically paycheck to paycheck."
00:23:23.819,00:23:25.612,Where the hell did he get it?
00:23:25.612,00:23:28.532,Why didn't you ask me?
00:23:28.532,00:23:30.159,I couldn't.
00:23:30.159,00:23:32.119,I knew what it would do to you.
00:23:32.119,00:23:34.955,"First he's murdered, and then for you to think..."
00:23:34.955,00:23:37.083,"I mean, it would burn you to the ground."
00:23:37.083,00:23:39.459,There'd be nothing left.
00:23:39.459,00:23:41.628,And you wouldn't talk to me.
00:23:41.628,00:23:47.301,Every night you were drinking yourself unconscious like you were the only one who lost him.
00:23:47.301,00:23:49.970,"I don't care. He was dirty, he was clean, I don't care."
00:23:49.970,00:23:54.141,All I want is for whoever killed Matty to rot in a cell for the rest of their life.
00:23:54.141,00:23:58.020,Then I want whatever's left of them just dumped in the trash.
00:23:58.020,00:24:00.606,"I don't care where it leads, what it uncovers."
00:24:00.606,00:24:05.403,"I mean, what difference would it make if he was anything?"
00:24:05.403,00:24:09.198,I'd still love him. I'd still miss him. He'd still be gone.
00:24:09.198,00:24:13.411,Matt wasn't dirty.
00:24:13.411,00:24:15.037,"Right now, this is it, Mike."
00:24:15.037,00:24:17.873,What was that phone call before he died?
00:24:17.873,00:24:22.378,Don't bullshit me.
00:24:22.378,00:24:24.630,So you're admitting it was you?
00:24:24.630,00:24:26.090,He wasn't dirty!
00:24:26.090,00:24:30.344,"Goddamn you, you get that through your head!"
00:24:30.344,00:24:34.348,My son wasn't dirty!
00:27:21.848,00:27:24.518,"Let him cry it all out, okay?"
00:27:26.395,00:27:28.188,"Hey, Mikey."
00:27:28.188,00:27:29.982,Mikey boy.
00:27:29.982,00:27:32.859,How you doing?
00:27:32.859,00:27:35.404,HOFFMAN: Good to see you too.
00:27:37.948,00:27:41.452,I know.
00:28:10.397,00:28:12.232,"BARTENDER: Closing time, Mikey."
00:28:12.232,00:28:16.320,"MIKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay."
00:28:16.320,00:28:17.863,How about I give you a lift home?
00:28:17.863,00:28:19.406,MIKE: Mm.
00:28:20.907,00:28:22.493,I'm fine.
00:28:22.493,00:28:24.453,I can't let you drive.
00:28:24.453,00:28:26.955,"No, I'm good, I'm good."
00:28:26.955,00:28:28.790,Don't worry.
00:28:28.790,00:28:32.752,"Anyway, I sold my car, so I'm walking."
00:28:32.752,00:28:34.254,Thank you.
00:28:35.839,00:28:40.093,"Albuquerque, New Mexico."
00:28:40.093,00:28:42.846,You ever been?
00:28:42.846,00:28:44.306,Well...
00:28:45.807,00:28:48.268,That's where I'm headed.
00:28:48.268,00:28:49.603,"Tarantulas, they got."
00:28:49.603,00:28:52.439,That's a big minus in my book.
00:28:52.439,00:28:57.152,"Well, I will be on the lookout."
00:28:57.152,00:28:58.820,"You take care, my friend."
00:28:58.820,00:29:00.656,Take care.
00:29:34.147,00:29:36.816,"HOFFMAN: Hey, Mike."
00:29:36.816,00:29:38.818,Mikey.
00:29:42.740,00:29:44.617,You want a ride?
00:29:44.617,00:29:47.035,I'm walking.
00:29:48.078,00:29:49.955,Pull over here.
00:29:56.962,00:29:58.422,HOFFMAN: What you doing out here?
00:30:00.048,00:30:01.883,It's colder than my ex-wife's tit out here.
00:30:01.883,00:30:04.428,"Come on, come on."
00:30:04.428,00:30:06.138,"Come on, don't be an ass."
00:30:06.138,00:30:07.723,Let us take you home.
00:30:08.932,00:30:12.185,Come on. Come on.
00:30:12.185,00:30:14.313,Come on.
00:30:14.313,00:30:16.732,"FENSKY: Okay, easy."
00:30:16.732,00:30:19.318,We're gonna have you home in no time.
00:30:25.991,00:30:29.495,"Hey, that's mine."
00:30:30.954,00:30:34.833,"Hey, now, we don't want you to shoot your foot off now, do we?"
00:30:51.224,00:30:53.686,"FENSKY: Hey, Mikey."
00:30:53.686,00:30:55.354,"Mikey, you with us?"
00:30:55.354,00:30:57.481,MIKE: What?
00:30:57.481,00:30:59.817,"Really tied one on good back there, buddy."
00:30:59.817,00:31:01.151,"Shit, yeah, he did."
00:31:01.151,00:31:04.446,Put it away like they were fixing to bring back Prohibition.
00:31:05.947,00:31:07.491,Hey.
00:31:05.947,00:31:09.868,"Hey, back at McClure's, you were talking out your ass. Hm?"
00:31:09.868,00:31:12.412,I know it was you. Heh.
00:31:12.412,00:31:16.416,"What's that supposed to mean, huh? You think you know what?"
00:31:16.416,00:31:18.711,Got something you wanna get off your chest?
00:31:18.711,00:31:21.004,Something you wanna say to us?
00:31:21.004,00:31:23.965,You killed him.
00:31:25.551,00:31:27.761,You killed Matty.
00:31:28.887,00:31:32.015,And you killed him for nothing.
00:31:33.141,00:31:38.980,You killed him because you were scared of what you thought he might do.
00:31:38.980,00:31:41.941,You got him in that crack house...
00:31:43.402,00:31:45.779,and you staged it.
00:31:58.500,00:32:00.627,But it was you.
00:32:02.379,00:32:05.424,And I know it was you.
00:32:09.678,00:32:12.264,And I'm gonna prove it.
00:32:45.088,00:32:47.299,Help me get him out of the car.
00:33:02.481,00:33:04.775,What?
00:33:04.775,00:33:07.694,There you go.
00:33:09.571,00:33:13.450,"All right, come on, Mike, huh?"
00:33:15.327,00:33:18.037,"Now, you wait there one second."
00:33:18.037,00:33:21.082,"We're gonna work this whole thing out, okay, Mikey?"
00:33:23.418,00:33:27.046,"So, what do we do now?"
00:33:29.090,00:33:32.177,"He couldn't live with it, Matt dying the way he did."
00:33:32.177,00:33:35.848,"It's too much for the old man, so Mike here decided to eat his gun."
00:33:35.848,00:33:39.225,"It's tragic, but anyone could see this coming."
00:33:39.225,00:33:41.102,He's drinking himself to death.
00:33:41.102,00:33:43.229,We're doing him a favor.
00:33:43.229,00:33:45.565,MIKE: Smart.
00:33:45.565,00:33:48.234,It's what I would've done if I were you.
00:35:26.959,00:35:31.504,"MIKE: You let some things slide, you look the other way."
00:35:31.504,00:35:37.594,You bust a drug dealer who has more cash than you'll ever earn in a lifetime.
00:35:37.594,00:35:42.933,"Some of it doesn't make it back into evidence, so what?"
00:35:42.933,00:35:46.728,You took a taste.
00:35:46.728,00:35:49.773,That's how you knew you were safe.
00:35:55.112,00:35:57.906,Everyone's guilty.
00:35:59.491,00:36:01.159,Matt wasn't dirty.
00:36:02.744,00:36:05.038,I was.
00:36:05.038,00:36:08.625,Everyone was in that precinct.
00:36:08.625,00:36:11.044,That's how it worked.
00:36:11.044,00:36:15.090,"You turn in your buddy, you're screwing yourself."
00:36:16.382,00:36:19.678,You go along to get along.
00:36:21.972,00:36:24.099,And you went along.
00:36:32.482,00:36:33.984,Yeah.
00:36:33.984,00:36:36.402,I did.
00:36:37.612,00:36:42.408,"Okay, but you said Matt didn't."
00:36:42.408,00:36:43.827,No.
00:36:43.827,00:36:46.121,Not Matt.
00:36:47.580,00:36:51.043,Fensky got to Hoffman early.
00:36:51.043,00:36:53.962,Kickbacks from some gang or another.
00:36:53.962,00:36:56.339,"Protection, basically."
00:36:56.339,00:36:59.051,And Hoffman went to Matty and offered to cut him in.
00:36:59.051,00:37:01.970,"Only fair, right?"
00:37:04.263,00:37:07.976,And Matt did what you would think.
00:37:11.312,00:37:14.107,And then he came to me.
00:37:14.107,00:37:17.402,"Wanted to go to the IA, do the right thing, shut 'em down."
00:37:19.779,00:37:21.489,'Cause he was gonna turn on those guys?
00:37:25.744,00:37:27.620,I told him...
00:37:30.456,00:37:33.501,You know what a cop fears most?
00:37:33.501,00:37:37.630,"More than getting shot, more than anything."
00:37:37.630,00:37:40.550,Prison.
00:37:44.096,00:37:48.558,"You threaten a cop with that, you make him dangerous."
00:37:48.558,00:37:50.476,That's what I told him.
00:37:50.476,00:37:52.645,I talked sense.
00:37:54.313,00:37:57.109,No one was getting hurt.
00:37:57.109,00:38:01.113,"But if you go to the IA, if you even look like you're going..."
00:38:02.697,00:38:04.908,He had a wife.
00:38:04.908,00:38:07.077,A kid.
00:38:07.077,00:38:09.204,Responsibilities.
00:38:16.753,00:38:18.671,Oh...
00:38:20.215,00:38:23.051,I tried.
00:38:23.051,00:38:24.844,I tried.
00:38:26.638,00:38:28.640,But he wouldn't listen.
00:38:31.350,00:38:33.937,My boy was stubborn.
00:38:38.900,00:38:41.987,And he was gonna get himself killed.
00:38:46.825,00:38:50.120,I told him I did it too.
00:38:50.120,00:38:52.622,"That I was like Hoffman, getting by."
00:38:52.622,00:38:55.458,And that's what you heard that night.
00:38:55.458,00:39:00.755,"Me talking him down, him kicking and screaming, until the fight went out of him."
00:39:00.755,00:39:03.591,He put me up on a pedestal.
00:39:08.554,00:39:15.394,And I had to show him that I was down in the gutter with the rest of 'em.
00:39:18.982,00:39:21.109,Broke my boy.
00:39:23.987,00:39:26.447,I broke my boy.
00:39:29.284,00:39:33.205,"He went to Hoffman, he took the money, but he hesitated."
00:39:33.205,00:39:41.671,"Even looking like you're doing the right thing, to those two, meant that he wasn't solid, that he couldn't be trusted."
00:39:46.134,00:39:48.511,I got Matty to take the money.
00:39:52.640,00:39:55.685,And they killed him two days later.
00:40:00.523,00:40:05.028,He was the strongest person that I ever knew.
00:40:05.028,00:40:09.241,"He'd have never done it, not even to save himself."
00:40:10.742,00:40:13.161,I was the only one.
00:40:14.495,00:40:18.917,I was the only one that could get him to debase himself like that.
00:40:23.046,00:40:25.298,And it was for nothing.
00:40:27.217,00:40:29.594,I made him lesser.
00:40:31.304,00:40:33.973,I made him like me.
00:40:38.728,00:40:41.647,And the bastards killed him anyway.
00:41:01.000,00:41:03.628,Hoffman and Fensky...
00:41:06.256,00:41:12.553,"if they killed Matty, who killed them?"
00:41:13.888,00:41:16.266,Pop?
00:41:16.266,00:41:18.143,What happened?
00:41:22.647,00:41:24.983,You know what happened.
00:41:27.193,00:41:29.321,The question is...
00:41:32.615,00:41:34.784,can you live with it?
00:00:48.215,00:00:54.179,"Once again, I do all the talking."
00:00:54.262,00:00:56.724,That's the only way this works.
00:01:06.525,00:01:07.902,Hand it over.
00:01:07.985,00:01:10.445,"Now, before that happens-- Hand it over."
00:01:10.529,00:01:13.866,"Hey, I've got it right here. Is this it?"
00:01:15.409,00:01:17.202,I will take that as a yes.
00:01:17.285,00:01:20.121,Heh. Very well. Mystery solved.
00:01:20.205,00:01:23.208,"I could take you into custody right now, you son of a bitch."
00:01:23.291,00:01:24.209,Both of you.
00:01:24.292,00:01:26.253,"Whoa, whoa. Where's this coming from?"
00:01:26.336,00:01:28.923,"You spilled the coffee, you ambulance-chasing piece of shit."
00:01:32.718,00:01:36.847,"Look, 45 minutes ago, I'm sound asleep."
00:01:36.931,00:01:40.684,"I get a call from Mr. Ehrmantraut, he's concerned."
00:01:40.768,00:01:45.647,He's getting threatening voicemails from you accusing him of petty theft.
00:01:45.731,00:01:48.650,"I tell him, Hey, we're gonna nip this in the bud."
00:01:48.734,00:01:52.446,"I don't care what the hell time it is, we're gonna go talk this thing out."
00:01:52.529,00:02:03.582,"And walking across the parking lot, just now, boom, there's a notepad, plain as day, lying on the asphalt where, I can only surmise, you accidentally dropped it, detective."
00:02:03.665,00:02:07.836,"Now, guys, that's all we know."
00:02:10.464,00:02:12.132,"Let me tell you something, slick."
00:02:12.215,00:02:14.468,Wait till I get you back to Philadelphia.
00:02:14.551,00:02:19.014,JIMMY: I'm confused. The state of Pennsylvania can extradite people for returning lost property?
00:02:19.098,00:02:22.476,Wow. That is one bold legislature.
00:02:22.559,00:02:26.313,Anything you wanna say to me about what you found in here? Hm?
00:02:26.396,00:02:29.608,Now that it's all out in the open?
00:02:29.691,00:02:31.234,Maybe your daughter-in-law.
00:02:31.318,00:02:33.612,Maybe she's got something to tell me.
00:02:33.695,00:02:37.449,Maybe. Maybe not.
00:02:37.532,00:02:40.953,"ABBASI: Yeah, we'll see. First thing tomorrow."
00:02:41.036,00:02:45.874,You gotta figure she wouldn't reach out to us if she had nothing to say.
00:02:45.958,00:02:51.254,Hopefully whatever you are didn't rub off on the rest of your family.
00:03:02.016,00:03:03.892,Thanks. You're welcome.
00:03:03.976,00:03:06.394,Let's get the hell out of here. MIKE: No.
00:03:06.478,00:03:08.438,I mean thanks as in three's a crowd.
00:03:08.522,00:03:10.065,You can go now.
00:03:12.026,00:03:14.153,You're not talking to my client without me.
00:03:14.235,00:03:16.071,"MIKE: Yeah, he is."
00:03:16.155,00:03:18.615,Please leave now.
00:03:30.209,00:03:32.171,"SANDERS: Oh, man."
00:03:34.548,00:03:37.425,I guess that's what this is.
00:03:44.599,00:03:47.561,Could be the altitude.
00:03:47.644,00:03:50.189,"We're a mile up, right?"
00:03:55.069,00:03:57.112,Sorry about the kid.
00:03:57.196,00:03:59.823,"He's young, looking to make his mark."
00:04:02.325,00:04:04.119,I like him.
00:04:07.581,00:04:10.500,"Your daughter-in-law, what...?"
00:04:10.584,00:04:12.753,What's she gonna tell us?
00:04:14.880,00:04:17.257,I don't honestly know.
00:04:20.427,00:04:25.099,"Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say, this pretty well ends it here."
00:04:27.142,00:04:30.729,So maybe you should talk to her before we do.
00:04:30.812,00:04:33.815,I talked.
00:04:33.899,00:04:37.903,"If I were to guess, I'd say she wouldn't tell you much."
00:04:41.615,00:04:44.159,"Either way, that's up to her."
00:04:45.911,00:04:48.163,That's the least I owe her.
00:04:52.042,00:04:56.171,There's a lot of people we both know that think Fensky got what was coming to him.
00:04:58.548,00:05:00.801,That whole precinct was a sewer.
00:05:02.886,00:05:07.682,Wouldn't be surprised if there's a few more early retirements.
00:05:07.766,00:05:10.685,Might be a good thing. New blood.
00:05:16.066,00:05:17.818,Like the kid.
00:05:19.402,00:05:21.613,Yeah.
00:05:21.696,00:05:24.741,He's all right.
00:05:24.825,00:05:27.244,"He's just gotta learn, that's all."
00:05:28.578,00:05:31.957,Some rocks you don't turn over.
00:06:12.831,00:06:15.792,What'd you say to him? Let's go.
00:06:15.876,00:06:18.461,"Word for word, verbatim, while it's still fresh."
00:06:18.545,00:06:22.174,What I said is none of your concern.
00:06:22.257,00:06:32.600,"I was speaking to a friend. Heh, heh. You were speaking to a homicide detective who flew 2000 miles to investigate a double murder for which you are clearly the prime suspect."
00:06:38.857,00:06:41.235,"You used to be one of them. So, what got said?"
00:06:41.318,00:06:43.528,Right now. Come on. I'm serious.
00:06:43.611,00:06:51.452,"I know you're trying to help, but-- Look, no, I'm trying to help me. Those two Philly cheese steaks, they wanna lock me up right alongside you."
00:06:51.536,00:06:54.248,"So work with me here, for the both of us."
00:06:54.331,00:06:56.250,"You're safe, counselor."
00:06:56.333,00:06:59.294,And I no longer require your services.
00:06:59.378,00:07:00.962,"You're kidding, right?"
00:07:01.046,00:07:03.548,"What, you think you're gonna defend yourself?"
00:07:03.631,00:07:05.300,It's in someone else's hands.
00:07:05.384,00:07:07.886,"What, like God? No."
00:07:07.969,00:07:10.513,Please don't say Hamlin Hamlin &amp; McGill.
00:07:10.597,00:07:14.935,"I appreciate your help. Go home, go to bed, send me your bill."
00:07:15.018,00:07:17.478,"Oh, I'm sending you my bill."
00:07:19.398,00:07:21.358,You better believe it.
00:07:34.829,00:07:38.541,"JIMMY: It's me, your friendly neighborhood ice man."
00:07:38.625,00:07:40.668,There was a run on bacon.
00:07:40.752,00:07:42.963,I'll get you next time.
00:07:43.046,00:07:44.965,"Chuck, you there?"
00:07:46.549,00:07:48.176,Chuck.
00:07:50.720,00:07:52.347,Chuck?
00:07:56.476,00:07:58.437,"Chuck, you up there?"
00:07:58.519,00:07:59.980,Hello?
00:08:00.063,00:08:01.982,CHUCK: I'm out here.
00:08:03.442,00:08:05.026,Chuck?
00:08:10.073,00:08:12.742,"One-twelve, 113, 114..."
00:08:12.826,00:08:14.661,"Holy shit, what are you doing? Shh!"
00:08:14.744,00:08:21.376,"One-fifteen, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120."
00:08:21.460,00:08:24.045,"Go, go. Inside."
00:08:25.755,00:08:28.008,JIMMY: What the hell was that?
00:08:29.634,00:08:32.137,What the hell was that? Just give me a second.
00:08:32.220,00:08:34.097,Ah...
00:08:36.016,00:08:37.642,Okay.
00:08:38.893,00:08:40.645,"Yeah, okay."
00:08:40.728,00:08:42.897,"It's an experiment, really."
00:08:42.981,00:08:47.110,I've been attempting to build up a tolerance for electromagnetic fields.
00:08:47.194,00:08:48.987,Seriously? Yeah.
00:08:49.070,00:08:50.530,"Yeah, it's like, um..."
00:08:50.613,00:08:55.910,"You know, like taking small doses of poison to build up an immunity."
00:08:55.994,00:08:57.537,Is that a real thing?
00:08:57.620,00:08:59.747,Because that does not sound like a real thing.
00:08:59.831,00:09:01.666,It's a real thing.
00:09:01.749,00:09:10.091,"Anyway, as you well know, there is a 60 kilovolt transformer 200 meters south-southwest of my front yard."
00:09:10.175,00:09:12.260,I've been trying to get acclimated to it.
00:09:12.344,00:09:14.346,I got up to two minutes today.
00:09:14.429,00:09:16.181,"Jesus, Chuck. Yeah."
00:09:18.725,00:09:21.936,I'm trying to get up to five minutes by next week.
00:09:22.020,00:09:23.938,That is just...
00:09:24.022,00:09:26.316,"Uh, but why now?"
00:09:26.400,00:09:33.365,"After what happened with the police and the hospital, I almost lost everything, Jimmy."
00:09:33.448,00:09:35.367,I can't go on like this.
00:09:39.371,00:09:40.872,I have to get back to work.
00:09:40.955,00:09:44.501,Sitting here rotting away.
00:09:44.584,00:09:47.462,This is no kind of life for me. For anyone.
00:09:47.546,00:09:50.215,I need to be useful again.
00:09:51.674,00:09:55.720,"Chuck, I am so proud of you."
00:09:55.803,00:09:57.931,"Oh. Heh, heh."
00:09:58.014,00:10:00.600,It'll be a long process.
00:10:00.683,00:10:03.520,But one to which I'm very much committed.
00:10:03.603,00:10:06.398,I have to be.
00:10:09.150,00:10:11.152,I-- I'll be right back.
00:10:11.236,00:10:13.154,I gotta get a few more things out of the car.
00:10:13.238,00:10:14.489,All right.
00:10:29.504,00:10:31.965,What's all this? It's just some case files.
00:10:32.048,00:10:33.383,I'm out of room at the office.
00:10:33.467,00:10:35.218,I don't wanna leave them in the car.
00:10:35.302,00:10:37.262,There's a lot of sensitive information.
00:10:37.345,00:10:40.348,You're not planning to leave them here?
00:10:41.975,00:10:43.893,It'll just be for a little while.
00:10:43.977,00:10:47.481,I'm practically sleeping on these things back at my place.
00:10:47.564,00:10:50.609,Business is that good? Heh. It's booming.
00:10:50.691,00:10:52.902,Streets of gold. Yeah.
00:10:52.986,00:10:54.904,I'll get these out of here as quick as I can.
00:10:54.988,00:10:59.909,I just need to file the 413s on some of these wills and I'll be out of your hair.
00:10:59.993,00:11:02.996,Four-thirteens? Personal property statements.
00:11:03.079,00:11:04.705,You mean 513s.
00:11:04.789,00:11:07.250,"Yeah, sorry. I was just working with these seniors."
00:11:11.963,00:11:15.967,"Um... Ahem. So, uh, we good here?"
00:11:16.050,00:11:18.094,"See you tomorrow, same time."
00:11:55.507,00:12:01.555,"James McGill. Scott said he'd leave the keys to 801, the suite that's for lease."
00:12:01.638,00:12:03.764,Here you go. Bring them back when you're done.
00:12:03.848,00:12:05.600,Got it.
00:12:05.684,00:12:10.021,"Wow, this is, like, really nice. Ha, ha."
00:12:10.104,00:12:11.523,Why do you sound surprised?
00:12:11.606,00:12:14.484,"Not surprised, no. Just..."
00:12:14.568,00:12:16.444,"You know, could you afford this?"
00:12:18.946,00:12:21.700,The seniors have been very good to me.
00:12:21.782,00:12:23.826,"I've been meaning to expand, you know?"
00:12:23.910,00:12:26.037,It's time to invest in myself.
00:12:26.120,00:12:29.748,I figure this may be just the place.
00:12:29.832,00:12:32.544,"Well, won't you miss the nail salon?"
00:12:32.627,00:12:36.755,"Oh, I could always visit, you know, get some French tips."
00:12:45.640,00:12:47.183,Wow.
00:12:47.267,00:12:48.893,JIMMY: It's a clean slate.
00:12:48.976,00:12:51.438,Put the reception desk right here.
00:12:51.521,00:12:54.065,"Uh, get some comfortable seating for the clients."
00:12:56.984,00:12:59.028,"JIMMY: Yeah, I like the openness."
00:12:59.112,00:13:01.531,"I feel like I can breathe in here, you know?"
00:13:01.615,00:13:07.161,It's not some claustrophobic little closet that smells like acetone. Heh.
00:13:07.245,00:13:09.623,Room to grow.
00:13:09.706,00:13:12.500,"Dream big, I say."
00:13:12.584,00:13:18.548,"Got a decent-size conference room. Not as big as Hamlin's, but, you know, it's cozy."
00:13:18.632,00:13:21.342,"Our elderly brethren prefer that, I find."
00:13:21.426,00:13:23.094,Yeah. Could be cozier though.
00:13:23.177,00:13:25.388,Maybe you could embroider some little cushions.
00:13:25.472,00:13:27.390,Crochet a runner for the table.
00:13:27.474,00:13:29.976,Rocking chairs all around? Yes.
00:13:30.059,00:13:33.187,Make it look like the front of a Cracker Barrel. Huh?
00:13:33.271,00:13:34.606,Now you're talking.
00:13:34.689,00:13:36.441,This is me.
00:13:38.735,00:13:40.737,I love it.
00:13:40.819,00:13:43.615,"Gotta look successful to be successful, am I right?"
00:13:43.698,00:13:46.951,"Well, this definitely looks like success. Heh."
00:13:47.034,00:13:50.371,Great view. Get you a big fancy desk in here.
00:13:50.455,00:13:52.873,Cocobolo desk. A what?
00:13:52.957,00:13:56.919,"I don't know what it means, but I just like saying the word. Cocobolo."
00:13:57.003,00:14:00.674,"Okay, well, whatever it is, you deserve it."
00:14:02.967,00:14:05.762,And I want you to see this one.
00:14:14.604,00:14:15.854,"Ha, ha. Whoa."
00:14:17.357,00:14:20.318,This is way better than the other one.
00:14:20.401,00:14:23.196,"You think? Uh, yeah. Who goes in here?"
00:14:27.283,00:14:30.745,"JIMMY: Yeah. Yeah, you know, you're right."
00:14:30.829,00:14:33.331,It is real nice. It's a corner office.
00:14:34.999,00:14:36.334,Saving it for someone.
00:14:36.417,00:14:38.252,"Who? Well, my partner."
00:14:38.336,00:14:40.463,Your partner? Who's...?
00:14:42.507,00:14:44.091,Who would that be?
00:14:48.971,00:14:52.433,That's-- That is so...
00:14:52.517,00:14:55.520,Thank you. Really.
00:14:55.603,00:14:58.690,But you know I've got a lot invested at HHM.
00:14:58.773,00:15:01.651,"With what's going on now, I'm closer than ever to partner."
00:15:01.735,00:15:04.111,"Like maybe two years, and I'm in."
00:15:04.195,00:15:06.155,"Yeah, I know."
00:15:06.239,00:15:09.576,"Yeah, it's... It's just a thought."
00:15:09.659,00:15:12.746,"Plus, you know, they put me through law school."
00:15:12.829,00:15:14.205,I feel like I owe them.
00:15:14.288,00:15:17.542,"Actually, I do owe them, literally, you know?"
00:15:17.625,00:15:20.961,"But it's a nice thought, Jimmy."
00:15:21.045,00:15:23.840,"Just, uh, you know, playing with ideas."
00:15:23.923,00:15:25.717,I had the extra office and everything.
00:15:32.014,00:15:35.852,I want to see the kitchen.
00:15:40.648,00:15:42.650,Wow.
00:15:42.734,00:15:45.278,They have stainless in here.
00:15:45.361,00:15:47.321,I don't even have stainless at home.
00:15:53.703,00:15:56.038,KIM: I know this is the last thing you wanna hear.
00:15:56.122,00:16:01.586,I think your chances of getting a favorable ruling from a jury are very slim.
00:16:03.504,00:16:05.089,CRAIG: What does that mean?
00:16:05.172,00:16:07.425,We're not in a great position to win at trial.
00:16:07.508,00:16:11.053,But we came to you people because we were told you win cases.
00:16:11.137,00:16:13.598,Winning doesn't always mean getting a favorable verdict.
00:16:13.681,00:16:19.353,We try to achieve the best outcome for our clients given each individual case.
00:16:19.437,00:16:26.444,"Frankly, we've worked very hard to stave off an arrest, after the misunderstanding about your, uh, camping trip."
00:16:26.527,00:16:28.780,The DA was concerned you might be a flight risk.
00:16:28.863,00:16:30.782,Heh. Flight risk?
00:16:30.865,00:16:33.534,We were practically in our own backyard. Heh.
00:16:33.618,00:16:35.578,That's exactly what we told the DA.
00:16:35.662,00:16:39.707,We've managed to come up with a deal that is favorable under the circumstances.
00:16:39.791,00:16:42.627,Deal. I hate that terminology. A deal is what they got O.J.
00:16:42.710,00:16:45.254,Maybe we should hear it. It's a terrible term.
00:16:47.799,00:16:57.016,"If the prosecution decides to file, which is the direction this seems to be headed, and if they choose to stack charges, Craig, you're looking at 30 years in prison."
00:16:57.099,00:16:59.268,Thirty years? KIM: That's the maximum.
00:16:59.352,00:17:03.982,"Given the nature of the charge and political environment, I'd say we should expect it."
00:17:04.064,00:17:20.999,"The public outcry in cases like these is a big factor. However, after much discussion with the DA, who is also invested in keeping the press to a minimum, we have arrived at an arrangement which would include 16 months in a county facility. Sixteen months?"
00:17:21.081,00:17:22.959,Down from 30 years.
00:17:25.044,00:17:27.672,But he would have to say he was guilty.
00:17:27.755,00:17:32.927,"Admitting wrongdoing and making the county whole again goes a long way, hence the minimal sentence."
00:17:33.011,00:17:34.929,Making the county whole again?
00:17:35.013,00:17:40.018,It includes the stipulation that you return $1.6 million in misappropriated funds.
00:17:40.100,00:17:41.978,Give back the money? There is no money.
00:17:42.061,00:17:44.522,We told you Craig is innocent.
00:17:44.605,00:17:52.196,"I understand. However, I'd like to emphasize again that this deal is Craig's best chance of minimizing jail time."
00:17:52.279,00:18:00.287,"You're telling us there are drug dealers and murderers walking the streets, but instead of them, they wanna put an innocent man in jail?"
00:18:00.371,00:18:03.249,There's no other way? I'm sorry.
00:18:03.332,00:18:05.960,"I think under the circumstances, this is your best option."
00:18:06.044,00:18:10.214,"Murderers and rapists, and this is how they--?"
00:18:10.297,00:18:13.217,Okay. There is no money. There never was.
00:18:13.300,00:18:21.475,"You have to take this to trial. KIM: Look, you have a difficult, but nevertheless straightforward choice to make here."
00:18:21.559,00:18:25.939,"On one hand, you give up the money-- Ah-- I just told you, there is no money."
00:18:26.022,00:18:28.900,"Plead guilty. It's painful, I know."
00:18:28.983,00:18:35.907,"And go to jail for a year and a half. But your other choice, that is no choice at all."
00:18:40.620,00:18:45.708,Your children will grow up seeing their dad through bars on visiting day.
00:18:47.585,00:18:49.963,I know what I'd do.
00:18:50.046,00:18:52.840,I'd take the deal.
00:18:52.924,00:18:54.842,"Two years from now, you can be starting over."
00:18:54.926,00:18:58.471,"It's tough, I know."
00:18:58.554,00:19:00.347,But you're tough people.
00:19:08.106,00:19:10.274,Why don't I give you a few moments to discuss this?
00:19:10.357,00:19:12.068,I know it's a big decision.
00:19:12.151,00:19:14.361,We don't need to discuss it.
00:19:15.947,00:19:17.239,You're fired.
00:19:19.659,00:19:21.911,How about we go to my office and discuss this?
00:19:21.995,00:19:24.163,There's a solution. That won't be necessary.
00:19:24.246,00:19:26.332,We will no longer be requiring your services.
00:19:26.415,00:19:30.878,"It's not personal. If you're unhappy, there may be other directions."
00:19:30.962,00:19:32.964,We are done. Please stop following us.
00:19:35.049,00:19:36.634,"Don't look back, honey."
00:19:36.717,00:19:38.928,"Only look forward. Always in life, look forward."
00:19:43.850,00:19:47.269,JIMMY: O-70. O-70.
00:19:47.353,00:19:50.064,"Oh, yeah. Seventy's a good age."
00:19:50.148,00:19:54.068,"All right, duck your heads, because here comes another number."
00:19:54.152,00:19:56.946,N-32.
00:19:57.030,00:20:00.116,And the action never stops.
00:20:00.199,00:20:04.203,"I hope you all took your heart pills, because it's almost too much excitement, right?"
00:20:04.286,00:20:06.080,Which one will it be?
00:20:06.164,00:20:08.207,"Say your prayers, here it comes."
00:20:08.290,00:20:11.627,All right. We've got G-48.
00:20:11.711,00:20:16.132,"G, as in Guy Lombardo. G-48."
00:20:16.215,00:20:18.801,"Keep your elbows to yourselves, okay?"
00:20:18.885,00:20:20.761,No body-checking.
00:20:20.845,00:20:24.140,"All right, what do we have here? Wait for it."
00:20:24.223,00:20:25.599,B-6.
00:20:30.437,00:20:32.065,Which you should be taking.
00:20:32.148,00:20:34.859,Keep things moving in the old GI tract.
00:20:34.942,00:20:36.318,Bingo.
00:20:39.155,00:20:41.115,Lady Luck has struck again.
00:20:46.829,00:20:49.165,"Congratulations, miss, you've won a, um..."
00:20:50.833,00:20:52.126,A notebook.
00:20:52.210,00:20:54.712,"Yeah, it's an adorable notebook."
00:20:54.795,00:20:56.089,"Do you like cats, Miss...?"
00:20:56.172,00:20:59.008,"Oh, oh. Irene. I love kitties."
00:20:59.092,00:21:01.802,"I have two Siamese cats, Oscar and Felix."
00:21:03.262,00:21:06.348,Felix can wash himself. Oscar won't.
00:21:06.432,00:21:08.559,He-- He just won't.
00:21:08.642,00:21:11.687,What a lovely story. Thank you. Um...
00:21:11.771,00:21:15.608,"Can you take that to Irene, and when you come back, cover?"
00:21:15.691,00:21:20.988,"I'm gonna take a short break, because somebody needs legal help. Heh, heh."
00:21:33.167,00:21:38.505,"Yes, yes, of course. Um, one moment, please."
00:21:38.589,00:21:41.092,"Déjà vu, hello again. Good to see you."
00:21:41.175,00:21:42.426,CRAIG: Nice to see you.
00:21:42.509,00:21:44.344,So how may I be of service?
00:21:44.428,00:21:48.808,"We would like to hire you as our attorney, Mr. McGill."
00:21:48.891,00:21:51.769,Wow. Really?
00:21:51.852,00:21:53.813,"BETSY: However, we have certain conditions."
00:21:53.896,00:21:55.481,And these are not up for debate.
00:21:55.564,00:21:57.316,We want no jail time. Zero.
00:21:59.944,00:22:02.446,We won't see his name smeared like this any longer.
00:22:02.529,00:22:04.573,"Um, can we back up just a scootch?"
00:22:04.657,00:22:10.163,"Because last time we spoke, you were very enthusiastic-- You were positively insistent."
00:22:10.246,00:22:12.581,--about being represented by HHM.
00:22:12.665,00:22:15.542,Well-- Oh. That's all right.
00:22:18.045,00:22:20.714,May I ask why?
00:22:20.798,00:22:25.719,We disagreed with their defense strategy.
00:22:25.803,00:22:27.138,Okay.
00:22:27.221,00:22:30.891,They treated us like we were guilty.
00:22:30.975,00:22:34.103,So your previous objections to my representing you are now...?
00:22:38.149,00:22:39.984,Unfortunate. Mm-hm.
00:22:40.067,00:22:42.611,"CRAIG: Yeah, we really-- We're very sorry about that."
00:22:42.695,00:22:45.823,"We thought long and hard about it, and, um, we..."
00:22:45.906,00:22:53.206,"You know, given your passion and your can-do attitude, we really-- We just believe you're the lawyer for us."
00:22:55.875,00:23:01.964,"Well, as flattered as I am by this, um, since we last spoke, I've changed my area of specialization."
00:23:04.717,00:23:07.011,"CRAIG: But I mean, you said that you would fight for us."
00:23:07.094,00:23:08.971,"Yeah, you-- You were adamant."
00:23:09.055,00:23:11.307,You promised to get us a not-guilty verdict.
00:23:11.389,00:23:13.391,I don't think I exactly promised that.
00:23:13.475,00:23:16.687,"BETSY: You said we would be Client Number 1, morning, noon or night."
00:23:18.647,00:23:22.235,But times change.
00:23:22.318,00:23:25.071,But we've already paid you a retainer.
00:23:27.781,00:23:30.701,Right. A retainer.
00:23:30.784,00:23:32.578,That is what you called it.
00:23:32.661,00:23:36.249,That was your specific terminology.
00:23:36.332,00:23:38.416,Could you excuse me for a moment?
00:23:38.500,00:23:41.087,I had a Big Gulp on the way over.
00:23:41.170,00:23:43.005,"Oh. Ha, ha."
00:23:51.264,00:23:53.266,KIM: Hey. Hey there.
00:23:55.517,00:23:59.021,Funny story. I found something that belongs to you. Again.
00:23:59.105,00:24:00.940,Yeah? What? Who?
00:24:01.023,00:24:04.442,Picture The 25th Hour starring Ned and Maude Flanders.
00:24:04.526,00:24:06.737,"Oh, Christ, the Kettlemans?"
00:24:06.820,00:24:09.782,You lose any other clients today? Yeah.
00:24:09.865,00:24:13.953,Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo-Bananas just offered me the plum job of defending them.
00:24:14.036,00:24:16.163,"They came to you? Yeah, I know."
00:24:16.247,00:24:19.666,"I don't know what you did to piss them off, but it must have been good."
00:24:19.750,00:24:21.585,What did they tell you? Not much.
00:24:21.668,00:24:25.214,Just that you treated them like they were guilty.
00:24:27.758,00:24:35.891,"Look, Jimmy, I know-- I know this is a lot to ask, but you have to convince them to come back to HHM."
00:24:35.975,00:24:38.060,"I do, huh? Yes."
00:24:38.144,00:24:39.895,Please. It's important.
00:24:39.979,00:24:42.273,"What's it worth to you? Jimmy, I'm serious."
00:24:42.356,00:24:51.031,"They left because they think they can win this case, but they can't. I managed to scrape together, from practically nothing, I might add, a deal they should feel lucky to have."
00:24:51.115,00:24:53.617,This is their absolute best bet.
00:24:54.785,00:25:00.540,Please? Make them understand it's better for them if they come back.
00:25:00.624,00:25:03.127,Tell me about this deal.
00:25:03.210,00:25:04.753,Elder law?
00:25:04.837,00:25:07.340,I don't know what that is. I don't either.
00:25:08.632,00:25:10.050,Elder.
00:25:10.134,00:25:14.388,What do you do with-- Maybe if we were older-- Sorry. Whoo. Oh.
00:25:14.472,00:25:17.057,The mysteries of the bladder. Right?
00:25:17.141,00:25:19.352,Ha-ha-ha. So how do we get started?
00:25:19.435,00:25:22.146,Do you need us to sign that little paper?
00:25:22.229,00:25:26.150,"I am-- I am very sorry, but I'm afraid I can't take your case."
00:25:26.233,00:25:30.196,My schedule is just-- It's just chock-full right now.
00:25:30.279,00:25:32.990,I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.
00:25:33.073,00:25:35.368,I'm certain they would welcome you with open arms.
00:25:35.451,00:25:37.328,"No, we're not going back there."
00:25:37.411,00:25:40.331,They were... incompatible.
00:25:40.414,00:25:43.209,I understand. They asked you to face some harsh realities.
00:25:43.292,00:25:45.503,And I get it. No one likes that.
00:25:49.840,00:25:52.134,She has a great relationship with the DA.
00:25:52.218,00:25:58.556,"Much as I'd love to sing my own praises, I doubt I could get you a deal as good as the one she already has."
00:25:58.640,00:26:01.977,Okay. We don't want a deal.
00:26:02.061,00:26:05.147,"We want you, our lawyer, to exonerate Craig."
00:26:05.231,00:26:09.235,"Exonerate? That is a big word, particularly in your case."
00:26:09.318,00:26:12.112,But there will be no deal.
00:26:12.196,00:26:14.281,There is no money with which to make a deal.
00:26:17.284,00:26:22.580,Can we all three just parachute down from Cloud Cuckooland?
00:26:22.664,00:26:26.001,Because we know without question there is money.
00:26:26.085,00:26:32.799,"I distinctly remember a spirited game of tug-of-war over this money, money which we then discussed at length."
00:26:32.883,00:26:36.220,You made many excuses justifying your possession of said money.
00:26:36.303,00:26:41.641,"It's there. It exists-- BETSY: But that-- Shh, shh! Just, please, for my own sanity."
00:26:41.725,00:26:46.980,"You can't hide a big bag of cash forever, and you certainly will never be able to spend any of it."
00:26:47.064,00:26:54.405,"So go back to HHM, apologize to Ms. Wexler, and for chrissakes, take the deal."
00:26:56.532,00:26:58.658,"If there were any money-- Lady, enough."
00:27:05.499,00:27:09.002,Every penny would have to be present.
00:27:09.086,00:27:12.214,Every single penny.
00:27:12.298,00:27:14.425,You understand?
00:27:15.551,00:27:18.304,All of it.
00:27:18.387,00:27:20.847,"That includes the 30,000-- Craig, yes, he gets it."
00:27:20.931,00:27:23.142,"CRAIG: Yeah, he gets it."
00:27:23.225,00:27:27.187,"We are in this together, Mr. McGill, come what may."
00:27:28.481,00:27:32.526,"Now, where do we begin?"
00:27:55.090,00:27:56.883,There you go. Kettleman.
00:27:56.967,00:27:58.927,That's all of it. Where's Kim?
00:27:59.011,00:28:00.887,"Oh, we moved her over to the east wing."
00:28:00.971,00:28:03.681,The east wing? That's the cornfield.
00:28:03.765,00:28:06.101,"Why are you sending her to the cornfield, Howard?"
00:28:06.185,00:28:07.645,Never heard it called that before.
00:28:07.727,00:28:10.189,"Well, that's what you call it."
00:28:10.272,00:28:13.317,You're gonna punish her because you lost those batshit Kettlemans?
00:28:13.400,00:28:16.529,You notice I'm not exactly crowing over how I snaked them away from you.
00:28:16.612,00:28:18.447,"Jimmy, here are your files."
00:28:18.531,00:28:22.451,I'm not gonna discuss my employee policies with you.
00:28:25.871,00:28:27.789,You sure are.
00:29:05.244,00:29:07.538,JIMMY: That prick firing you?
00:29:07.621,00:29:12.084,KIM: Best-case scenario is my two-year plan just became a ten-year plan.
00:29:12.167,00:29:14.587,JIMMY: That schmuck. You didn't do anything wrong.
00:29:14.670,00:29:17.506,KIM: I lost the client. JIMMY: Not your fault.
00:29:17.590,00:29:21.301,"They're not really playing with a full deck, those Kettlemans."
00:29:21.385,00:29:24.513,"You had to take their case? I'm sorry, okay? I tried."
00:29:24.597,00:29:26.682,I really did.
00:29:26.765,00:29:29.059,I'm not being fair. Of course you tried.
00:29:29.142,00:29:31.811,They'll do what they wanna do.
00:29:36.900,00:29:40.153,I doubt you'll be able to do more for them than we were offering.
00:29:40.237,00:29:42.573,"You think very highly of my skills, obviously."
00:29:42.656,00:29:45.618,"It's not that, Jimmy. It's a loser case."
00:29:45.701,00:29:48.787,That deal was their best chance.
00:29:48.870,00:29:53.542,"After I worked my ass off finagling with the DA, it's just, like... Whatever."
00:29:53.626,00:29:55.252,"There's gotta be a way, you know?"
00:29:55.335,00:30:01.550,I take it to court-- You'll lose Kettleman did a terrible job covering his tracks.
00:30:01.634,00:30:05.345,"For starters, they've got reams of checks he wrote for false expenses."
00:30:11.518,00:30:15.230,"We're never supposed to say our clients are guilty but, hey, not my client anymore."
00:30:15.314,00:30:16.940,He's guilty as sin.
00:30:19.901,00:30:21.445,None that I could find.
00:30:21.528,00:30:25.324,There has to be a way. Not without the money.
00:30:25.407,00:30:27.159,It's the only chip those Kettlemans have.
00:30:27.242,00:30:28.619,They refuse to play it.
00:33:48.861,00:33:54.491,"--is made. Rennings throws, and it is a liner toward the gap in right-center field."
00:37:41.509,00:37:43.261,Jesus.
00:37:43.344,00:37:46.472,Gets bigger every time I look at it.
00:37:46.556,00:37:50.393,Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.
00:38:17.003,00:38:18.546,What are you doing?
00:38:18.630,00:38:21.925,The right thing.
00:38:23.635,00:38:25.637,You know where you're going?
00:38:25.720,00:38:27.847,Yeah. Ahem.
00:38:32.185,00:38:35.855,Am I correct in assuming we're now square?
00:38:35.939,00:38:37.565,Square.
00:38:55.541,00:38:59.171,"Oh, it's Mr. McGill. Good morning. Come on in. Heh."
00:39:05.718,00:39:08.638,"Oh, I love what you've done with the place."
00:39:08.721,00:39:14.311,"Last time I was here, it was, uh, well, not a contender for the cover of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure."
00:39:15.895,00:39:19.983,"Do you have news about our case? I do, in fact."
00:39:20.066,00:39:23.820,"But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal."
00:39:23.903,00:39:27.240,"Ah-- We told you, there will be no deal."
00:39:27.324,00:39:29.784,"You did, didn't you?"
00:39:29.868,00:39:32.495,"However, circumstances have changed."
00:39:32.578,00:39:34.164,What circumstances?
00:39:34.247,00:39:40.086,"To answer that, um, might I suggest that you go check on that money you insist you didn't take?"
00:39:42.005,00:39:45.424,"In the upstairs bathroom, under the sink?"
00:39:45.508,00:39:48.094,Wait. How could you--?
00:39:52.140,00:39:53.850,Betsy?
00:40:05.444,00:40:08.406,"BETSY: No, no, no. CRAIG: It's okay, Betsy."
00:40:16.831,00:40:18.208,What did you do with it?
00:40:18.291,00:40:19.959,"By it, you mean...?"
00:40:23.338,00:40:25.173,You mean the money.
00:40:25.257,00:40:27.717,"Uh, let me see. Uh..."
00:40:27.800,00:40:30.178,It's on its way to the DA's desk right about now.
00:40:30.262,00:40:32.889,What? You--?
00:40:32.972,00:40:34.224,You thief.
00:40:34.307,00:40:35.683,"Takes one to know one, doesn't it?"
00:40:35.767,00:40:37.727,You took it? How did you take it?
00:40:37.810,00:40:40.105,A good magician never reveals his secrets.
00:40:40.188,00:40:41.940,"Now, here's what we're gonna do."
00:40:42.023,00:40:47.028,"Oh, you don't tell us what to do. You stole from us. We-- We will have you arrested."
00:40:49.364,00:40:55.036,"Uh, I can see how upset you are, and even on a good day, you and logic are..."
00:40:56.371,00:40:57.997,But think about what you just said.
00:40:58.081,00:41:00.292,"Criminals have no recourse, and you two?"
00:41:00.375,00:41:02.919,You're criminals. Big time. How dare you?
00:41:03.002,00:41:09.968,"Luckily, you have a very talented lawyer who has found a way to minimize the damage you've brought upon yourselves."
00:41:10.051,00:41:13.054,"Oh, you're fired. Oh, I quit already."
00:41:13.138,00:41:14.764,"No, I'm talking about Kim Wexler."
00:41:14.847,00:41:22.855,"Now, you're gonna go back to her, apologize for your hasty decision to terminate her services, and you're gonna fall on her mercy and take that deal."
00:41:22.939,00:41:25.524,We'll tell about the bribe you took.
00:41:25.608,00:41:27.944,JIMMY: You could do that.
00:41:28.027,00:41:32.949,"You absolutely could, and I'd be in a mess of trouble, a real pickle."
00:41:33.032,00:41:36.202,"But so would you, Mrs. Kettleman."
00:41:36.286,00:41:41.166,Because right now only Mr. Kettleman is on the hook for the whole embezzlement kerfluffle.
00:41:41.249,00:41:44.127,But the bribe-- We're back to calling it a bribe?
00:41:44.210,00:41:46.463,"Yeah, that implicates you as well."
00:41:46.545,00:41:48.840,It does not. It was all me.
00:41:48.923,00:41:51.801,"JIMMY: No, it wasn't. I'll make sure everyone knows that."
00:41:54.304,00:41:56.014,"Look on the bright side, you know?"
00:41:56.097,00:42:00.810,They could work out some kind of inter-prison visitation program.
00:42:00.893,00:42:04.063,The occasional conjugal. Maybe it won't be all bad.
00:42:04.147,00:42:08.360,"You, you'll probably wind up running your own gang."
00:42:08.443,00:42:11.446,Thing you folks need to know about me?
00:42:11.529,00:42:14.157,I got nothing to lose.
00:42:14.240,00:42:16.784,"Christ, you should see my office."
00:42:20.538,00:42:23.249,"No, it's not over."
00:42:23.333,00:42:24.625,Let's find another lawyer.
00:42:24.709,00:42:27.586,"Oh, Betsy. No, no. No."
00:42:27.670,00:42:29.964,We don't have to put up with this.
00:42:30.048,00:42:33.676,I will not be treated this way. Betsy.
00:42:33.759,00:42:43.978,The kids. The-- We have to do this for the kids.
00:42:44.062,00:42:47.857,They can't lose us both. Oh...
00:42:50.235,00:42:52.404,CRAIG: We have to. BETSY: No.
00:42:52.487,00:42:53.696,"CRAIG: Shh, shh."
00:42:56.241,00:42:57.867,It's okay.
00:42:59.369,00:43:03.498,"It's okay. Shh, shh."
00:00:33.074,00:00:36.161,"JIMMY: Hey, Gene. Thanks, Jimmy."
00:00:36.244,00:00:38.831,"JIMMY: Trina. Hey, Jimmy."
00:00:38.914,00:00:41.082,"JIMMY: Got a package, Dan."
00:00:46.714,00:00:48.382,How's it going?
00:00:48.465,00:00:50.091,What's up?
00:01:13.448,00:01:14.616,Hey.
00:01:14.700,00:01:16.451,"Hey, yourself."
00:01:16.535,00:01:19.329,"Jimmy, I'm really slammed. Just tell me what you need."
00:01:21.707,00:01:22.958,What is it?
00:01:29.256,00:01:30.424,I can't open it.
00:01:52.529,00:01:54.281,"So, what does it say?"
00:02:03.040,00:02:14.051,"I must call to your attention the newly passed Environmental Impact and Sustainability Assurance Act, a statute that as you know, went into effect without any ex post facto provisions in place."
00:02:14.134,00:02:17.888,"You got a second? Not really. I'm-- It'll just take two seconds, I promise."
00:02:17.972,00:02:19.139,All right.
00:02:21.349,00:02:22.893,What's this?
00:02:27.606,00:02:28.774,Is this a joke?
00:02:28.857,00:02:31.192,Nope. No joke.
00:02:31.276,00:02:34.071,You-- You passed the bar?
00:02:36.573,00:02:39.994,"I thought if Kim can do it, maybe I can too, you know?"
00:02:40.077,00:02:43.914,So I got my last few credits for undergrad from a community college.
00:02:46.750,00:02:49.920,Then I found a law school that would accept me.
00:02:50.004,00:02:52.422,"I mean, it wasn't Georgetown or anything, but..."
00:02:53.841,00:02:55.926,The University of American Samoa.
00:02:56.010,00:02:57.761,"Oh, correspondence school."
00:02:59.513,00:03:02.557,Nights. Weekends. You know.
00:03:02.641,00:03:06.812,They call it distance learning nowadays. They're accredited.
00:03:10.149,00:03:14.069,"And the bar exam's a mother. I mean, for me, it was."
00:03:14.153,00:03:18.365,"I failed it the first two times, but I guess it's like losing your virginity."
00:03:18.448,00:03:20.784,Third time's the charm.
00:03:20.868,00:03:22.786,This must have taken you years.
00:03:22.870,00:03:25.204,And you kept it a secret all this time?
00:03:25.288,00:03:28.583,Why? You didn't come to me for help?
00:03:28.667,00:03:31.045,"Jesus, Chuck. You're the busiest guy I know."
00:03:31.128,00:03:33.254,You're doing important shit.
00:03:36.758,00:03:38.177,I don't know what to say.
00:03:38.259,00:03:40.804,Are you proud of me?
00:03:42.430,00:03:43.598,Yes.
00:03:43.682,00:03:45.308,Absolutely.
00:03:45.392,00:03:48.436,"Thanks, Chuck. That means a lot."
00:03:50.189,00:04:00.490,"Oh, hey. I was hoping, you know, if you think it's appropriate, once I get sworn in and everything, consider hiring me."
00:04:00.574,00:04:04.203,"As what? Oh, a lawyer."
00:04:04.285,00:04:06.454,Obviously. Yeah.
00:04:10.792,00:04:14.796,"Uh, you know, it's not my decision alone."
00:04:14.880,00:04:17.841,But how could they say no?
00:04:17.925,00:04:19.384,So much drive.
00:04:19.467,00:04:22.387,"Jimmy, look what you've done here."
00:04:26.641,00:04:28.268,KIM: I told those guys devil's food.
00:04:28.351,00:04:29.770,JIMMY: I will sue the store for you.
00:04:29.853,00:04:32.647,KIM: Good. BURT: Just remember us when you're all big time.
00:04:32.731,00:04:34.315,"JIMMY: I don't remember you now, Burt."
00:04:34.399,00:04:41.990,"MAN: You representing mail room, so you show those upstairs jackholes how it gets-- Hey. What're you folks up to? Having a party?"
00:04:42.074,00:04:46.036,KIM: Just a little celebration on behalf of New Mexico's newest attorney.
00:04:46.120,00:04:48.956,"I heard. Jesus, Jimmy. You're a regular Charlie Hustle."
00:04:49.039,00:04:50.916,"Congratulations, my friend. Oh, thank you."
00:04:50.999,00:04:52.584,"Would you like some cake? Oh, here."
00:04:52.667,00:04:55.170,"Um, don't mind if I do."
00:04:55.254,00:04:57.256,"Really, really impressive, Jimmy."
00:04:57.338,00:04:59.133,We're all proud of you.
00:04:59.216,00:05:02.427,"Hey, I hate to interrupt, but could you guys give Jimmy and me a moment?"
00:05:02.510,00:05:04.930,Sure. Yeah. Absolutely.
00:05:09.935,00:05:11.603,"Please, sit down."
00:05:49.557,00:05:52.019,Let's reassess in six months.
00:05:52.102,00:05:54.146,"Thanks for understanding, Jimmy."
00:05:54.229,00:05:56.481,You want the door open or closed?
00:05:56.564,00:05:57.732,Closed.
00:06:42.401,00:06:43.904,How's it going?
00:06:43.987,00:06:45.239,Settling back in.
00:06:45.322,00:06:46.990,Great.
00:06:47.074,00:06:49.534,So apparently they are ready for us.
00:06:49.617,00:06:51.286,Oh. Thanks.
00:06:51.370,00:06:53.621,But I wanted to get a couple of things done before lunch.
00:06:53.705,00:06:57.500,"And I'm still trying to-- Come on, Kim. You deserve this."
00:06:58.710,00:07:00.254,Come bask in the glow.
00:07:04.716,00:07:06.593,HOWARD: Thank you all for coming.
00:07:06.676,00:07:09.137,I appreciate you making time in the middle of your busy days.
00:07:09.221,00:07:17.687,"I'm pleased to announce that working closely with the Bernalillo County District Attorney's Office, we've reached a plea agreement for former treasurer Craig Kettleman."
00:07:17.771,00:07:24.319,"We believe this is a just and fair outcome, and brings to a close an incident Mr. Kettleman deeply regrets."
00:07:24.403,00:07:26.363,He is committed to making amends...
00:07:26.446,00:07:27.697,Can I help you?
00:07:27.781,00:07:29.490,Yeah. I'm here to see Mrs. Landry.
00:07:29.574,00:07:30.450,Ah.
00:07:35.080,00:07:36.331,Are you a relative?
00:07:36.415,00:07:37.749,Lawyer.
00:07:37.832,00:07:41.795,Ahem. But I treat my clients like family.
00:07:41.878,00:07:43.630,You know where to find her?
00:07:43.713,00:07:45.257,Yeah. Thanks.
00:07:53.848,00:07:57.936,"Uh, oh. Hey. Pick a card, any card."
00:07:59.146,00:08:01.148,All right.
00:08:01.231,00:08:04.234,"How's it going there? Good. Whoa, not so tight."
00:08:04.318,00:08:07.487,Oh. Shh.
00:08:07.570,00:08:10.573,A little surprise from the card fairy.
00:08:12.242,00:08:13.410,Give me that squeeze.
00:08:13.493,00:08:18.748,"Squeeze whatever you got that's below the water that I can't see. Oh, yeah."
00:08:18.832,00:08:20.000,"All right, Mrs. Landry."
00:08:20.083,00:08:24.254,"Just a few more signatures and, uh, ahem, thy will be done."
00:08:24.338,00:08:26.089,Would you like another Hydrox?
00:08:26.173,00:08:28.425,"No, thank you. I'm all Hydrox'd out."
00:08:28.508,00:08:31.386,"Oh, well, please help yourself if you change your mind."
00:08:31.470,00:08:34.014,All right. That one.
00:08:34.097,00:08:36.475,Okay. And that one.
00:08:39.060,00:08:40.854,And that is it.
00:08:40.937,00:08:42.481,Oh. What a relief.
00:08:42.563,00:08:44.524,I should have done this years ago.
00:08:44.607,00:08:46.234,"Well, people do tend to put it off."
00:08:46.318,00:08:48.945,But everybody should have a will.
00:08:49.029,00:08:51.198,Please tell your friends.
00:08:51.281,00:08:55.285,And that comes to $140.
00:08:55.369,00:08:58.079,And I'm happy to take cash or a check.
00:08:58.163,00:09:00.165,"Or, uh, cash."
00:09:07.964,00:09:10.133,One moment.
00:09:22.603,00:09:23.813,Could you write me a check?
00:09:23.897,00:09:29.027,"Well, it's been so long, I really don't know if I have enough in my account."
00:09:29.110,00:09:31.488,I am so sorry. This is awful.
00:09:31.571,00:09:34.949,But all I have is $43.
00:09:36.993,00:09:38.161,Okay.
00:09:38.245,00:09:40.080,"Now, I could ask for an advance."
00:09:40.163,00:09:41.915,I-- I am so sorry.
00:09:41.998,00:09:44.418,It's fine. I don't know what to say.
00:09:44.501,00:09:47.128,This is awful.
00:09:47.212,00:09:51.383,Oh. You could keep the will until I get my allowance.
00:09:51.466,00:09:54.428,And that should only be until the end of next week.
00:09:54.511,00:09:56.930,That's not necessary. Here's my address.
00:09:57.013,00:10:00.434,Just mail it to me when you've got it. All right?
00:10:00.517,00:10:07.148,And why don't we-- We'll just make it an even 120. All right?
00:10:07.232,00:10:10.068,Oh. Thank you.
00:10:10.151,00:10:11.903,You have a nice day.
00:10:20.620,00:10:23.206,Excuse me. Allowance?
00:10:23.290,00:10:25.666,Your family has you on an allowance?
00:10:25.750,00:10:27.752,No. No. It's-- It's my money.
00:10:27.835,00:10:30.297,I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing.
00:10:30.380,00:10:33.133,Five hundred dollars a month-- I don't understand.
00:10:33.216,00:10:37.095,You should have social security checks plus that pension we talked about.
00:10:37.178,00:10:38.388,So how are you on an allowance?
00:10:38.472,00:10:40.807,"Well, the checks go to Sandpiper."
00:10:40.890,00:10:45.186,And then they take out my fees and my expenses.
00:10:45.270,00:10:46.771,Why don't you just come on in?
00:10:46.854,00:10:48.607,I'm afraid I'm not explaining it very well.
00:10:51.192,00:10:54.070,I-- I have statements here.
00:10:54.154,00:10:57.324,Somewhere. Somewhere.
00:10:57.407,00:11:02.287,So your pension and social security goes straight to the Sandpiper people?
00:11:02.370,00:11:06.333,They take out-- They take out what they need.
00:11:06.416,00:11:09.961,And then I get my allowance.
00:11:10.044,00:11:14.382,Here. And all the rest goes into my savings account.
00:11:14.466,00:11:16.759,It's really all very above-board.
00:11:16.843,00:11:19.762,A lot of places do it this way.
00:11:22.390,00:11:25.602,"Well, yes. They-- They try to make everything easy for us."
00:11:29.230,00:11:34.444,"Mrs. Landry, are any of your friends around who I could talk to?"
00:11:37.864,00:11:40.867,"So I went in the house, I told the house..."
00:11:40.950,00:11:43.161,I could not find...
00:11:48.333,00:11:52.170,"JIMMY: In order to find out, you have to look on the back."
00:11:52.253,00:11:54.088,Okay. And see this key.
00:11:54.172,00:11:57.676,"See, you have reading glasses. Could I borrow your glasses?"
00:11:57.758,00:11:59.636,Yes. Thank you.
00:11:59.718,00:12:03.431,"Oh, these are gonna help me, but I don't know if they'll do the trick."
00:12:04.765,00:12:06.100,So tiny.
00:12:06.184,00:12:08.853,Four. Ten. Twelve.
00:12:08.936,00:12:12.399,I think it might be Q-tips. I can't tell.
00:12:12.482,00:12:15.734,"It's probably an accident, but we should look into it, don't you think?"
00:12:15.818,00:12:17.696,"They're not doing this intentionally, okay?"
00:12:17.778,00:12:19.614,This could be a mistake.
00:12:19.698,00:12:22.659,"If we correct the mistake, then you'll get some money back."
00:12:22.741,00:12:24.536,And it'll be fair.
00:12:25.870,00:12:27.455,"JIMMY: Hey, Chuck."
00:12:29.416,00:12:34.045,My boxes. The ones I left-- Oh.
00:12:40.759,00:12:44.097,Sandpiper Crossing. Sandpiper Crossing.
00:12:45.557,00:12:47.808,"Did you do my wills? CHUCK: Yes, I did."
00:12:47.892,00:12:49.352,"JIMMY: Hey, would you look at that?"
00:12:51.271,00:12:52.980,This was a one-time thing.
00:12:53.064,00:12:55.900,And don't think I don't see what you were doing here.
00:12:59.362,00:13:01.698,"God help me, it worked."
00:13:01.780,00:13:05.577,You need help? Hire a paralegal. Stand on your own two feet.
00:13:05.660,00:13:08.079,Yeah. Sure. I'll do that.
00:13:08.162,00:13:09.497,You're not even listening to me.
00:13:09.581,00:13:11.832,"No. I hear you, Chuck, okay?"
00:13:14.835,00:13:16.296,What did I just say?
00:13:16.379,00:13:19.633,"Take a look, okay? Just right here."
00:13:21.426,00:13:24.178,All I'm asking is for you to take a look. Please?
00:13:24.262,00:13:26.598,Sandpiper Crossing.
00:13:26.681,00:13:28.891,"It's a retirement home, assisted living."
00:13:28.975,00:13:32.019,This is one of their invoices they send their residents.
00:13:32.103,00:13:34.230,What exactly am I looking for here?
00:13:34.314,00:13:36.149,Nothing earthshaking. Just little things.
00:13:36.232,00:13:38.652,Little things like-- Like this right here.
00:13:38.735,00:13:41.904,Fourteen dollars for code 118-62.
00:13:41.988,00:13:43.490,What's 118-62?
00:13:43.573,00:13:44.741,I wonder.
00:13:47.201,00:13:49.036,How could you even read this?
00:13:49.120,00:13:50.664,It's like microfilm.
00:13:58.045,00:14:02.634,118-62 is facial tissue.
00:14:03.968,00:14:05.512,Fourteen bucks for a box of Kleenex.
00:14:05.595,00:14:06.929,JIMMY: Yeah. And I found others.
00:14:07.013,00:14:11.726,"There's three and half dollars for a single roll of toilet paper, 22 bucks for aspirin."
00:14:11.810,00:14:14.270,It's a clear pattern of overcharging.
00:14:14.354,00:14:16.815,Nothing huge but adds up to real money.
00:14:16.939,00:14:18.566,"I mean, here, look."
00:14:18.650,00:14:21.944,"This woman, she got soaked for, like, 400 bucks last month."
00:14:22.028,00:14:25.114,And there's a pretty solid attempt at concealment of that fact.
00:14:29.786,00:14:32.580,This was in work I did?
00:14:32.664,00:14:34.081,Yeah. You must have missed it.
00:14:34.165,00:14:37.293,"Um... Look, Chuck."
00:14:37.377,00:14:39.546,"I got lucky, right?"
00:14:39.629,00:14:41.798,Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.
00:14:41.881,00:14:44.801,"This is no mom and pop outfit, okay? I dug around a little."
00:14:47.512,00:14:50.557,I'm working on getting more info but this could be big.
00:14:50.640,00:14:54.018,"I mean, this could be a big case, right?"
00:14:54.101,00:15:03.319,"Well, if it's more than a few errant billings, and if it's systematic and you establish a pattern, it could be class action."
00:15:05.029,00:15:06.865,"What do I do now? I mean, what next?"
00:15:06.947,00:15:08.408,"Well, you need more information."
00:15:08.491,00:15:09.992,You don't want to go off half-cocked.
00:15:10.076,00:15:11.828,Full cock.
00:15:11.911,00:15:15.331,"Okay. Now, I'm gonna head back there. Thank you."
00:15:15.415,00:15:17.375,You're the best.
00:15:31.055,00:15:32.973,Back to see Mrs. Landry.
00:15:35.268,00:15:36.895,Okay.
00:15:36.977,00:15:38.145,What gives?
00:15:40.732,00:15:44.068,We're concerned about solicitation on the premises.
00:15:44.151,00:15:46.780,I'm not a gigolo if that's what you're implying.
00:15:46.863,00:15:48.907,Legal solicitation.
00:15:48.989,00:15:52.619,We are obligated to protect our residents from being harassed.
00:15:52.702,00:15:54.954,And we have the right to refuse entry.
00:15:58.374,00:16:00.376,They have a legal right to meet with me.
00:16:00.460,00:16:03.838,"Well, you'll just have to arrange to meet them elsewhere."
00:16:07.508,00:16:09.761,"Oh, come on, guys. Seriously?"
00:16:09.844,00:16:16.183,"What, are you making Soylent Green back there? It's-- All right. Okay. I-- I'm backing away."
00:16:16.267,00:16:17.435,Yeah?
00:16:21.105,00:16:23.441,You know what? Um...
00:16:23.524,00:16:26.986,"Hey, this has gotten me a little bit stirred up down there."
00:16:27.069,00:16:31.449,Can I use your restroom? Please. I've got IBS.
00:16:31.532,00:16:33.409,Go ahead.
00:17:00.019,00:17:02.939,To Sandpiper Crossing.
00:17:02.981,00:17:09.612,"Clients of James M. McGill, this is to inform you-- PAULA: Sir, are you all right in there?"
00:17:09.696,00:17:17.829,"JIMMY: We believe that-- Breach of contract-- Come on now, sir. I've been very patient."
00:17:17.912,00:17:21.499,Clear pattern of malfeasance-- Negligent infliction of emotional distress.
00:17:21.582,00:17:23.501,"Sir, I really need you to finish up and come out."
00:17:23.584,00:17:26.587,Contact by the end of the week or I will be forced to move forward.
00:17:26.671,00:17:33.511,I need you to finish-- This is a demand letter informing Sandpiper Crossing of pending litigation for defrauding my clients through systematic overcharging.
00:17:35.680,00:17:37.724,I can hear you. Stop right now.
00:17:37.807,00:17:39.767,"This here. This makes it official, all right?"
00:17:39.851,00:17:43.103,"If you don't stop shredding now, that's destruction of evidence."
00:17:43.187,00:17:46.148,"Spoliation, that's what it's called. And it's a felony."
00:17:46.232,00:17:49.109,So call your lawyers right now and tell them I said that. Me!
00:17:49.193,00:17:52.030,"James McGill, Esquire."
00:18:17.304,00:18:19.473,Hey. STACEY: Hey.
00:18:19.557,00:18:22.769,Am I calling at a bad time? No. Not at all.
00:18:22.852,00:18:24.228,How you doing?
00:18:24.311,00:18:26.898,"Yeah, pretty good. Getting by."
00:18:26.981,00:18:28.441,How about you?
00:18:28.524,00:18:30.526,Getting by.
00:18:30.610,00:18:32.445,It's good to hear from you.
00:18:32.528,00:18:37.241,Yeah. I've been-- There's been a lot going on. You know how it is.
00:18:37.324,00:18:39.452,Yeah. I know.
00:18:39.535,00:18:43.998,"Uh, listen, I was-- Was hoping maybe you could do me a favor."
00:18:46.375,00:18:49.754,"It'd be during my shift, the day after tomorrow."
00:18:49.837,00:18:55.927,"I hate to ask, but my regular sitter's down-- Anything you need, I'll be there."
00:18:57.470,00:18:59.305,I don't want to impose or anything.
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.181,No. Anytime.
00:19:06.729,00:19:08.898,It's not an imposition.
00:19:08.982,00:19:10.650,Thanks.
00:19:13.111,00:19:14.988,Yeah. No problem.
00:19:15.071,00:19:16.530,At quarter to 2?
00:19:16.614,00:19:18.783,I'll see you then.
00:19:18.866,00:19:20.409,Okay.
00:21:07.725,00:21:09.518,Come on.
00:21:09.602,00:21:11.311,Where is it?
00:21:13.106,00:21:16.067,Oh. Oh...
00:21:16.150,00:21:18.819,Oh. Goddamn it.
00:21:28.412,00:21:31.124,It's not like we're close to being done.
00:21:31.207,00:21:33.751,"I mean, can't you get somebody else to do it?"
00:21:33.834,00:21:37.379,Right. They don't pay any of us enough for this shit.
00:21:37.463,00:21:43.803,And it's going on and on. And so I'm like: Why are you making your problems my problems?
00:21:43.886,00:21:46.055,Right. Like you don't have problems of your own.
00:21:46.139,00:21:48.933,MAN: Exactly. That's exactly what I'm saying. Thank you.
00:22:05.825,00:22:08.035,We're the law firm representing Sandpiper Crossing.
00:22:09.411,00:22:11.497,"Quite well, thank you."
00:22:11.580,00:22:14.250,How are you? Doing fine. Doing fine.
00:22:14.333,00:22:16.794,I'm sorry to call so late. Did I catch you at a bad time?
00:22:16.877,00:22:18.921,No. No. No. It's fine.
00:22:19.005,00:22:21.882,It's just that you're whispering.
00:22:21.966,00:22:23.676,I'm at the opera.
00:22:23.759,00:22:26.428,Oh. What opera?
00:22:26.512,00:22:27.680,Magic Flute.
00:22:27.763,00:22:29.182,Mozart. Lovely.
00:22:29.265,00:22:31.225,"Well, I'll try not to keep you."
00:22:31.309,00:22:36.480,We received something from you today and we're not quite sure what.
00:22:36.563,00:22:38.274,It's a demand letter.
00:22:38.356,00:22:48.617,"Ah. It was a little confusing because it was written on-- Well, I had to write it quickly, because your clients were in the process of destroying evidence."
00:22:48.701,00:22:53.371,"Mr. McGill, if you're talking about shredding documents, that's neither irregular nor illegal."
00:22:53.455,00:22:54.874,Every business in America does it.
00:22:54.957,00:22:57.668,"You say potato, I say spoliation."
00:22:57.751,00:23:00.378,Mm-hm. Maybe walk me through what you're alleging here.
00:23:00.462,00:23:02.422,I believe it's all in the letter.
00:23:02.506,00:23:04.050,I'm not saying it's not.
00:23:04.133,00:23:06.927,But it's a bit hard to read.
00:23:07.011,00:23:09.055,"Next time, I'd use double ply."
00:23:09.138,00:23:13.059,"Let's not fixate on the medium, okay? Let's look at the message."
00:23:13.142,00:23:21.984,"Your clients are facing multiple counts of elder abuse, and fraud, and deceptive and unfair trade practices."
00:23:22.068,00:23:23.903,"And that's just the start, okay?"
00:23:23.986,00:23:26.530,"I'm not a betting man, but I'd bet I'll find more."
00:23:26.613,00:23:29.909,"Mr. McGill, are you related to Charles McGill?"
00:23:29.992,00:23:31.911,He's my brother.
00:23:31.994,00:23:35.206,Yeah? How's he doing these days?
00:23:35.289,00:23:37.833,I fail to see the relevance of this.
00:23:37.917,00:23:43.756,"Frankly, the only reason that I made this phone call was out of respect for Charles on the off chance you might be related to him."
00:23:43.839,00:23:48.094,My partner suggested that the best response would be to send a Rule 11 letter and have you sanctioned.
00:23:48.177,00:23:50.054,But I didn't want to jump to that immediately.
00:23:50.137,00:23:54.892,"How about you stop trying to rattle my cage and just, you know, respond to the merits?"
00:23:54.975,00:23:56.476,"This is my response, Mr. McGill."
00:23:56.560,00:23:59.272,You have no good-faith basis to threaten litigation.
00:23:59.355,00:24:01.982,This is a shakedown and we both know it.
00:24:02.066,00:24:05.861,"Now, if you push this any further, my hands will be tied."
00:24:05.945,00:24:07.654,I'm sorry for interrupting your evening.
00:24:10.032,00:24:12.243,Blow my magic flute.
00:26:19.203,00:26:21.455,"Jimmy, what're you doing here?"
00:26:21.539,00:26:26.419,"Oh, Chuck. I'm sorry to show up like this."
00:26:26.502,00:26:28.921,I just needed space to work.
00:26:29.004,00:26:30.339,What is all this?
00:26:30.423,00:26:32.258,What have you done to my dining room?
00:26:32.341,00:26:34.801,"They were spoliating, the Sandpiper people."
00:26:34.885,00:26:37.346,They wouldn't let me in. I could see they were shredding.
00:26:37.430,00:26:40.724,"I wrote them a demand letter, I gave it-- You broke into a nursing home?"
00:26:40.807,00:26:43.185,Assisted living. And you stole their garbage.
00:26:43.269,00:26:46.021,"No, it was in public. There was no lock, no nothing."
00:26:46.105,00:26:48.190,I just lifted the lid and there it was.
00:26:48.274,00:26:52.319,"There's no reasonable expectation of privacy in that situation, is there?"
00:26:52.403,00:26:55.573,You can't say it's private if a hobo can use it as a wigwam.
00:26:55.655,00:26:58.742,"That's the standard, right, if animals or vagrants can get in?"
00:27:00.618,00:27:02.162,"More or less, yes."
00:27:02.246,00:27:04.622,"Okay, so this is all legal."
00:27:04.706,00:27:07.126,It's completely above-the-belt legal.
00:27:07.209,00:27:10.588,I just need to figure out what they're trying to cover up.
00:27:10.670,00:27:13.715,You don't shred like this unless you got something to hide.
00:27:13.799,00:27:15.675,"Not necessarily. Oh, come on, Chuck."
00:27:19.679,00:27:21.974,"No, it's not a coincidence. It's in here."
00:27:25.603,00:27:27.980,"Look, you won't even know I'm here, okay?"
00:27:28.063,00:27:29.856,I just need some space and some quiet.
00:27:29.940,00:27:33.068,And I'll be out of your hair as soon as-- Stop. Stop. It's okay.
00:27:33.152,00:27:35.488,You can work here. Thanks.
00:27:36.905,00:27:39.450,I don't mind the company.
00:27:39.533,00:27:42.702,You look like you could use a cup of coffee.
00:27:42.786,00:27:45.247,"Good God, yes."
00:28:28.248,00:28:30.459,"Up, up. Up."
00:28:30.543,00:28:32.294,"Shh, shh, shh."
00:28:35.673,00:28:37.216,God's sweet sake.
00:29:23.762,00:29:25.598,"Oh, good. You're up."
00:29:28.183,00:29:32.145,"Well, Jesus, Chuck, how long have I been asleep?"
00:29:32.229,00:29:34.231,"Chuck, how did you--?"
00:29:36.149,00:29:38.360,I can't believe this.
00:29:39.695,00:29:42.781,"Uh, thank you. This is a huge help."
00:29:45.701,00:29:48.287,"Well, it gets better."
00:29:48.370,00:29:50.122,What's this?
00:29:50.205,00:29:51.998,It's your smoking gun.
00:29:52.082,00:29:54.960,It's an invoice for syringes.
00:29:55.043,00:29:56.795,Yes. From?
00:29:56.878,00:30:00.006,"Morrissey Medical Supply. Lincoln, Nebraska."
00:30:00.090,00:30:02.551,So? Trust me.
00:30:02.635,00:30:05.137,"Meanwhile, we need to start pulling case law."
00:30:05.220,00:30:10.643,Any precedent dealing with 18 U.S.C. 1961 to '68.
00:30:10.726,00:30:17.399,"Probably not a bad idea to pull 30-47-1 from NMSA. Uh, 1978."
00:30:17.483,00:30:20.319,"I don't think that's gonna play, really."
00:30:20.402,00:30:22.488,But it's a good opening salvo for us.
00:30:22.571,00:30:23.905,Wait. Us?
00:30:25.741,00:30:27.242,We're working together on this?
00:30:27.326,00:30:30.162,"Mm. That's up to you, Jimmy."
00:30:36.669,00:30:39.212,All right. All right.
00:30:39.296,00:30:41.131,All right. Let's get to work.
00:30:58.440,00:31:00.317,"Kim Wexler. JIMMY: Hey, gorgeous."
00:31:00.400,00:31:03.487,"Oh, man. Sweet talking right out of the gate."
00:31:03.570,00:31:06.657,You want something. Make it fast. I want to go home.
00:31:06.740,00:31:10.243,Okay. Okay. Will you look something up for me on Westlaw?
00:31:10.327,00:31:11.787,Please?
00:31:11.870,00:31:14.456,You're lucky I'm a pushover.
00:31:14.540,00:31:16.583,All right. Hit me. Thank you.
00:31:16.667,00:31:19.712,Anything on Sedima v. Imrex.
00:31:19.795,00:31:22.840,Schlesinger v. Disney. Holmes v. SIPC.
00:31:22.922,00:31:25.050,"Whoa, slow down. Slow down. --v. Disney."
00:31:25.133,00:31:28.554,"Holmes v. SI-- PC, yeah."
00:31:28.637,00:31:34.518,"Anything on 5712, 1 though 24, NMSA, 1978."
00:31:34.601,00:31:38.063,"Ah, okay. It would help if I knew what you were looking for, here."
00:31:38.146,00:31:39.565,Anything. Everything.
00:31:39.648,00:31:41.734,You want me to just read you the headnotes?
00:31:41.817,00:31:43.652,No. No. Print it. Full cases.
00:31:43.736,00:31:45.529,And any cases that cite to those cases.
00:31:45.612,00:31:47.823,Shepardize like the wolf's at the door.
00:31:47.906,00:31:50.576,"Jesus, Jimmy. That's gonna be thousands of pages."
00:31:50.659,00:31:52.703,Pretty please with sugar on top?
00:31:52.786,00:31:54.538,Come on. You owe me one.
00:31:54.621,00:31:57.332,"Yes, I do. But this is gonna take hours."
00:31:57.416,00:31:59.585,And who do I bill it to? Bill it to Howard.
00:31:59.668,00:32:01.837,"I still remember his code, 1933."
00:32:01.920,00:32:03.756,Same year Hitler came to power.
00:32:03.839,00:32:06.842,You're not funny. I'm not billing it to my boss.
00:32:06.925,00:32:09.010,How about yours? I'll pay you back.
00:32:09.094,00:32:11.597,"Jimmy, this is three, four hundred bucks worth of printing."
00:32:11.680,00:32:13.682,"The accountants will find it, and I'll get fired."
00:32:13.766,00:32:15.434,"Which sounds fun, but no."
00:32:15.517,00:32:17.227,Okay. Hold on a sec.
00:32:21.648,00:32:24.735,Hey. Kim can't print without a code.
00:32:24.818,00:32:26.737,"Should I go there, take notes, come back?"
00:32:26.820,00:32:29.782,"No, no. It'd take too long. Use mine, 1868."
00:32:29.865,00:32:31.283,Yeah.
00:32:35.287,00:32:38.665,"1868, use that. It's Chuck's. You're using Chuck's number?"
00:32:38.749,00:32:40.626,Does Chuck know you're using Chuck's number?
00:32:40.709,00:32:41.960,We're working on something.
00:32:42.043,00:32:43.545,Bring it over to his place after.
00:32:43.629,00:32:45.004,You're a lifesaver.
00:32:45.088,00:32:46.840,Wait. You're working a case together?
00:32:46.924,00:32:50.302,Yeah. Keep this under your hat. But it's gonna be huge.
00:32:50.385,00:32:52.011,"Maybe a class action, even."
00:32:52.095,00:32:55.181,"We think it will settle for one, maybe two million."
00:32:55.265,00:32:58.477,How does that work? Chuck's a partner at HHM.
00:32:58.560,00:33:00.896,So what? I know Chuck's partnership agreement.
00:33:00.979,00:33:03.231,He can work with outside parties.
00:33:03.315,00:33:06.610,"That clause is intended for small-time stuff, pro bono cases."
00:33:06.693,00:33:08.695,So I'm bono. I'm very bono.
00:33:08.779,00:33:11.573,Chuck's a rock star. They'll work it out.
00:33:11.657,00:33:16.662,"And Chuck can handle this? Last time I saw him, he was-- Last time you saw him, he wasn't himself, okay?"
00:33:16.745,00:33:18.079,This is good for him.
00:33:19.915,00:33:21.291,Okay.
00:33:21.374,00:33:22.709,What?
00:33:22.793,00:33:26.588,I don't know. I'm just-- Whatever. I'll see you in a couple hours.
00:33:26.672,00:33:29.215,Okay. We're ordering a pizza. I'll save you a slice.
00:33:47.818,00:33:51.488,"Hey, you know, if you don't separate those, you're gonna end up with brown."
00:33:53.239,00:33:55.116,STACEY: Hello? Hey.
00:33:56.576,00:33:58.745,We're in here. Oh...
00:33:58.829,00:34:00.497,We're playing sculptor.
00:34:00.580,00:34:03.041,She's Michel-angelina.
00:34:04.710,00:34:08.338,"How's work? Oh, you know. Work."
00:34:08.421,00:34:09.923,How'd it go?
00:34:10.007,00:34:13.635,Kid's a dream. She's easy.
00:34:13.719,00:34:15.846,And you better stay that way.
00:34:18.264,00:34:21.894,"How you doing, sweetie, huh? Huh?"
00:34:21.977,00:34:24.730,Well. I better be going.
00:34:24.813,00:34:26.189,"Oh, wait. Hang on a sec, would you?"
00:34:26.272,00:34:28.942,I wanna talk to you about something.
00:34:29.026,00:34:31.028,What's up?
00:34:35.032,00:34:36.783,I wanna know what I should do with this.
00:34:38.451,00:34:40.579,I've been carrying it around for weeks.
00:34:40.662,00:34:43.415,"Like, holding on to it."
00:34:43.498,00:34:45.959,Every place I put it feels wrong.
00:34:46.043,00:34:52.340,"I thought about putting it in the collection plate, but that seemed, I don't know..."
00:34:52.424,00:34:55.427,"Look, with Matty gone, I have expenses."
00:34:55.510,00:34:58.430,"And the death benefit helped, but..."
00:34:58.513,00:35:04.019,What I wanna ask you is... can I spend this?
00:35:04.102,00:35:06.312,Stace...
00:35:06.396,00:35:13.236,"if this money helps you and Kaylee, if it does a single good thing in this world, then you spend every penny."
00:35:14.947,00:35:17.032,It's a relief.
00:35:17.115,00:35:19.200,It'll help a lot.
00:35:23.830,00:35:25.832,"Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket."
00:35:33.214,00:35:35.801,"I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them."
00:35:35.884,00:35:39.846,"I had one. The computer in the engine, it locked in the middle of the Rockies."
00:35:39.930,00:35:42.975,"Yeah, it decided I was overheating and that was it."
00:35:43.058,00:35:44.851,Yeah. I couldn't get it fixed for 100 miles.
00:35:44.935,00:35:47.270,I had to have it towed to Telluride. It was unbelievable.
00:35:48.605,00:35:50.107,No.
00:35:50.189,00:35:53.401,"No, it's the chip. It's the little..."
00:35:53.485,00:35:57.990,"Yeah. It's, like, 800 bucks, not counting labor..."
00:36:02.243,00:36:04.287,"Hey, Mel, can I call you back?"
00:36:13.713,00:36:16.967,"Chuck, the Sandpiper has landed."
00:36:29.228,00:36:32.607,Rich Schweikart. This is Alvin Reese. Phil Jergens.
00:36:32.691,00:36:34.818,"Thanks for coming. Whoa, I have to ask you."
00:36:34.901,00:36:37.195,Please leave electronics in the car.
00:36:37.278,00:36:39.781,"Laptops, BlackBerries, PalmPilots, watches."
00:36:39.865,00:36:42.200,"If you lick it and it goes bzzt, leave it here."
00:36:42.283,00:36:43.869,Why?
00:36:43.952,00:36:46.371,My brother Chuck has a certain sensitivity.
00:36:46.454,00:36:49.833,It's a medical condition. This is the price of admission.
00:36:49.916,00:36:53.003,"Yeah, I heard about this. Go ahead. It's fine."
00:37:02.679,00:37:05.306,"Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen. I'll be right back."
00:37:13.690,00:37:16.902,"Chuck, come on, buddy."
00:37:18.153,00:37:21.990,I'm-- I don't know if I can do this.
00:37:22.074,00:37:24.492,"You can do this, all right?"
00:37:24.576,00:37:28.830,"These guys-- Those guys, they're nothing, okay?"
00:37:28.914,00:37:32.125,They're the Pistons and you're the Bulls.
00:37:32.209,00:37:37.964,All right? All you gotta do is sit there and look intimidating.
00:37:38.048,00:37:41.426,They're scared of you already. And they should be.
00:37:41.509,00:37:43.887,You're Charles McGill.
00:37:43.970,00:37:46.556,Let's go. Let's go get 'em.
00:37:52.687,00:37:55.398,Oh. Hey.
00:37:55.481,00:37:57.525,"Do you remember me, Charles?"
00:38:01.071,00:38:05.200,"It was, Jesus, nine, ten years ago. Heh, yeah."
00:38:05.283,00:38:07.702,Our guys were suing the other guys.
00:38:07.786,00:38:09.370,They were suing us right back.
00:38:09.454,00:38:11.790,The city had some grievance with everyone.
00:38:11.873,00:38:14.793,"So we had to bundle, like, four actions together."
00:38:19.714,00:38:22.968,Huh? Addyston Pipe and Steel.
00:38:23.051,00:38:26.721,You turned it all antitrust and the whole thing went away in summary judgment.
00:38:28.890,00:38:32.351,I figured you'd be arguing in front of the Supreme Court someday.
00:38:34.312,00:38:37.356,"Well, it's good to see you. SCHWEIKART: Yeah."
00:38:41.111,00:38:44.823,"SCHWEIKART: All right. Well, let's get started. Um..."
00:38:44.906,00:38:46.699,We've read your revised demand.
00:38:46.783,00:38:49.202,It's quite a laundry list. Very creative.
00:38:49.286,00:38:53.456,"JIMMY: Yeah, creative. Like the way your clients have been billing my clients."
00:38:56.293,00:38:58.461,"Cute. You know, you're not gonna make this stick."
00:38:58.544,00:39:01.339,Setting aside evidentiary concerns-- Whoa.
00:39:01.422,00:39:03.716,Your guys couldn't afford 10 bucks for a padlock?
00:39:03.800,00:39:07.095,That's on them. Public property.
00:39:07.179,00:39:09.973,Maybe a judge sees that your way. Maybe he doesn't.
00:39:10.056,00:39:11.933,But the damages for elder abuse?
00:39:12.017,00:39:15.854,The statute requires proof that there was some undue influence.
00:39:15.937,00:39:18.439,Someone threatening the residents of Sandpiper Crossing.
00:39:18.523,00:39:23.195,No one has claimed there was a guy with a knife telling them to hand over lunch money.
00:39:23.278,00:39:26.906,There are a lot of assisted living facilities out there that may be disreputable.
00:39:26.990,00:39:28.658,But that's not the case with our client.
00:39:28.741,00:39:33.288,"All their facilities, all 12 of them, every single one, five-star rated."
00:39:33.371,00:39:37.542,"You go to any one of them right now, you'll see happy, healthy residents."
00:39:37.625,00:39:40.419,Sandpiper takes care of these people. They don't bilk them.
00:39:40.503,00:39:42.630,But we looked into it.
00:39:42.714,00:39:46.676,"And some of your clients have, in fact, been overbilled."
00:39:48.594,00:39:50.805,"It doesn't rise to the level of fraud, not even close."
00:39:50.889,00:39:55.227,"We've calculated the damages. All told, it's $46,320."
00:39:55.310,00:39:59.356,Mm-hm. So here's what we're prepared to do.
00:39:59.438,00:40:01.858,We're gonna make your clients whole.
00:40:01.941,00:40:04.861,A check for the 46 and change right now.
00:40:04.944,00:40:10.033,"And on top of that, we'll give you another 46K to cover your expenses."
00:40:10.116,00:40:14.204,"So what's that, 92? Let's call it $100,000 even."
00:40:14.287,00:40:15.830,We admit to no wrongdoing.
00:40:15.914,00:40:18.416,And your clients release all claims.
00:40:25.382,00:40:28.218,JIMMY: I think you're gonna need to do better than that.
00:40:31.304,00:40:33.431,SCHWEIKART: This was in your demand letter.
00:40:33.514,00:40:35.600,They're syringes. So?
00:40:35.683,00:40:39.854,"I don't know if you know this, but that's a standard item in an assisted living facility."
00:40:39.938,00:40:41.898,Correct. It's not what it is that matters.
00:40:41.981,00:40:43.149,It's where it's from.
00:40:44.692,00:40:46.403,"Lincoln, Nebraska."
00:40:46.485,00:40:48.738,"Go, Cornhuskers."
00:40:52.533,00:40:57.080,"Since you're not picking up what I'm putting down, I'll explain it to you."
00:40:57.163,00:41:04.629,"Nebraska, although they both begin with the letter N, actually turns out to be a different state than New Mexico."
00:41:04.712,00:41:10.885,So your client accepted shipments across state lines for its enterprise.
00:41:10.969,00:41:13.930,"In the U.S. mail, no less."
00:41:15.932,00:41:17.850,Are you trying to make this a RICO case?
00:41:17.934,00:41:19.978,Like our client is John Gotti or something?
00:41:20.061,00:41:23.731,"You know as well as I do, RICO's used mostly for business beefs."
00:41:23.815,00:41:28.027,Sedima establishes a pretty low threshold for RICO provisions to kick in.
00:41:29.362,00:41:32.073,"Interstate commerce is a bitch, huh?"
00:41:32.157,00:41:36.744,Soon as we establish a pattern to-- What was your word? Overbillings?
00:41:40.081,00:41:45.962,"You're looking at treble damages, so your 100 grand, I think you know where you can stick it."
00:41:51.926,00:41:53.803,Will you give us a moment?
00:42:06.483,00:42:10.236,"Well, what number exactly did you have in mind?"
00:42:11.904,00:42:13.114,Twenty million.
00:42:13.198,00:42:15.825,SCHWEIKART: Excuse me? You heard me.
00:42:21.622,00:42:23.541,Or we'll see you in court.
00:42:33.592,00:42:34.760,Hm.
00:42:37.138,00:42:39.932,JIMMY: Twenty million? CHUCK: Didn't you hear them?
00:42:40.016,00:42:44.312,This is a big company. Twelve separate facilities.
00:42:44.396,00:42:46.856,They can't possibly all be in New Mexico.
00:42:46.939,00:42:53.238,This is potentially a multi-state federal class action lawsuit with a RICO kicker at the penalty phase.
00:42:53.321,00:42:55.240,"Twenty million, that's conservative."
00:42:55.323,00:42:58.784,"Now, class cert, that's where we start."
00:42:58.868,00:43:01.787,I'll draft our complaint. Try to get us a conditional one.
00:43:01.871,00:43:03.289,They'll try to pierce it.
00:43:03.373,00:43:05.291,It should hold long enough to start discovery.
00:43:05.375,00:43:07.001,We need to get you back on the grounds.
00:43:07.085,00:43:09.504,Quash this prohibition against you.
00:43:09.587,00:43:12.631,Some injunctive relief. Maybe a TRO.
00:43:14.967,00:43:18.804,"Jimmy, do you want to get started on the TRO?"
00:43:18.888,00:43:20.098,Yeah. Yes.
00:43:46.874,00:43:50.587,It looks good. No heartworm. No mange.
00:43:50.669,00:43:53.714,Where'd you get her? Shelter.
00:43:53.798,00:43:57.260,Good. There's too many puppy mills out there.
00:43:57.343,00:43:59.220,I had a dachsie in the other day.
00:43:59.304,00:44:02.098,"Some douche bred her so much, poor thing."
00:44:02.181,00:44:06.978,She just had one giant hernia for a belly. Couldn't even walk.
00:44:07.061,00:44:10.273,Those people can go straight to hell as far as I'm concerned.
00:44:13.651,00:44:15.736,Anything else I can do for you?
00:44:17.238,00:44:19.282,You still in touch with your people?
00:44:19.365,00:44:22.076,Depends on the type of work you're looking for.
00:44:22.160,00:44:25.497,"Your do's, your don'ts Your wills, your won'ts."
00:44:25.580,00:44:29.584,"Well, you tell me what you got, I'll tell you what I'll do."
00:44:44.974,00:44:48.686,"Jesus, those mall walkers, those geezers are faster than you think."
00:44:51.105,00:44:53.399,I could sleep for a decade.
00:45:00.532,00:45:02.408,Did you get what I asked?
00:45:02.492,00:45:05.495,The code provisions. Oh...
00:45:05.578,00:45:07.121,Shit. Unh...
00:45:08.456,00:45:10.625,It's in the car.
00:45:12.502,00:45:16.172,"Just give me a minute. I'll, uh..."
00:45:16.255,00:45:17.840,I'll go.
00:45:24.389,00:45:25.848,Where's the--?
00:45:59.131,00:46:00.550,Chuck?
00:46:15.772,00:46:16.982,Chuck?
00:46:18.025,00:46:19.569,Yeah?
00:00:44.294,00:00:46.714,"Don't worry about that, all right?"
00:00:46.797,00:00:49.424,Look down. Look at the grass.
00:00:51.844,00:00:54.013,Kick off your shoes like this.
00:01:04.231,00:01:06.817,When was the last time you did that?
00:01:06.901,00:01:08.903,"Feels good, right?"
00:01:10.153,00:01:11.655,Yeah.
00:01:11.739,00:01:14.199,Grass between your toes.
00:01:14.282,00:01:17.369,Feels nice.
00:01:17.452,00:01:20.581,Yeah. Yeah.
00:01:20.664,00:01:22.499,Hm.
00:01:24.835,00:01:28.505,"Well, I think maybe-- Maybe it's time we go in."
00:01:28.589,00:01:31.299,We got a lot of work to do. We need to get ready.
00:01:31.383,00:01:33.510,You need to get ready.
00:01:33.594,00:01:36.972,"If I were Schweikart and Cokely, I'd seek a restraining order."
00:01:37.056,00:01:39.558,Turn this into a civil harassment issue.
00:01:39.641,00:01:44.312,Schweikart and Cokely can come after me with a restraining order or anything else they got.
00:01:45.731,00:01:47.733,Confidence is good.
00:01:47.816,00:01:50.861,"Facts on your side, better."
00:01:50.945,00:01:53.113,Know what you're walking into.
00:02:12.883,00:02:14.843,House needs a coat of paint. Yeah.
00:02:36.406,00:02:38.366,MIKE: I got her all her shots.
00:02:38.450,00:02:41.369,Healthy gums. And no worms. No fleas.
00:02:41.453,00:02:46.166,"I promise you, if the little sucker has fleas, I'll kick her butt myself."
00:02:46.249,00:02:49.461,"Yeah, it's just a dog..."
00:02:49.544,00:02:51.880,"Hey, it's good to have a dog around."
00:02:51.964,00:02:56.135,Bad guys think twice about breaking into a house with a dog.
00:02:56.217,00:02:59.304,"STACEY: Yeah, I bet that one's gonna keep a lot of burglars away."
00:02:59.387,00:03:01.222,It's just a thought.
00:03:02.975,00:03:06.311,"You know, you can always keep her over at my place."
00:03:06.394,00:03:08.856,Kaylee can visit her any time she wants.
00:03:12.067,00:03:16.780,"Well, if you decide to keep her, I got a giant bag of puppy chow out in the car for you."
00:03:16.864,00:03:19.825,All the supplies. Everything you need.
00:03:25.039,00:03:27.124,All right.
00:03:27.206,00:03:29.043,KAYLEE: Aw... What's that?
00:03:30.251,00:03:32.546,The dog can stay here.
00:03:32.629,00:03:34.255,You sure?
00:03:34.339,00:03:36.133,Yes.
00:03:43.223,00:03:45.225,Excuse me a minute.
00:03:50.939,00:03:52.357,Yeah?
00:04:00.032,00:04:01.533,Yup.
00:04:04.745,00:04:06.538,Got it.
00:04:13.754,00:04:15.923,Is everything okay?
00:04:16.006,00:04:19.134,Yeah. Just a lead on a job opportunity.
00:04:20.802,00:04:25.933,"Your Honor, Mr. Schweikart and his cohorts are attempting to keep me away from their victims."
00:04:26.016,00:04:27.226,Victims? My clients. Yes.
00:04:27.308,00:04:29.103,You're denying me access.
00:04:29.186,00:04:33.941,Even the worst prisoners in this building are allowed access to a lawyer.
00:04:34.024,00:04:38.195,"Are you saying my poor, elderly clients have fewer rights than jail inmates?"
00:04:38.278,00:04:41.364,"Not at all, and no one is denying Mr. McGill access to his clients."
00:04:41.448,00:04:43.033,We're denying access to the property.
00:04:43.117,00:04:47.829,It's semantics. Which is well within Sandpiper Crossing's rights. The building is private property.
00:04:47.913,00:04:49.081,Paid for by the residents.
00:04:49.164,00:04:50.832,But managed by licensed professionals.
00:04:50.916,00:04:52.793,"Okay. One at a time, gentlemen."
00:04:52.876,00:04:57.214,"Mr. Schweikart, you're denying him access on what grounds?"
00:04:57.297,00:05:01.093,These assisted living residents have a daily routine that they're used to.
00:05:01.176,00:05:06.223,"Mr. McGill, who is loud and flamboyant, is a disturbance to these routines."
00:05:06.306,00:05:09.350,"Residents who want to see a lawyer, free to leave whenever they want."
00:05:09.434,00:05:10.936,Leave whenever they want?
00:05:14.231,00:05:16.608,The most common phrase in this place?
00:05:16.691,00:05:18.526,I've fallen and I can't get up.
00:05:18.610,00:05:21.446,"There's phone consultations, mail and messenger services."
00:05:21.529,00:05:23.949,There's plenty of other ways to confer with clients.
00:05:24.032,00:05:29.788,"But for residents who don't want to be afflicted with Mr. McGill's presence, this becomes an issue of civil harassment."
00:05:32.749,00:05:35.502,"And FYI, old people adore me."
00:05:35.585,00:05:37.254,Okay. I've heard enough.
00:05:37.336,00:05:39.881,I have enough here to let me rule on this restraining order.
00:05:42.259,00:05:45.262,"Yeah. Ha-ha-ha. Don't worry, Chuck."
00:05:45.344,00:05:48.347,"That's not smoke you smell. That's me. Heh, heh."
00:05:48.431,00:05:50.684,This mo-fo is on fire.
00:05:50.767,00:05:55.230,Your baby bro kicked some Schweikart ass today.
00:05:55.314,00:05:57.482,What the hell's all this?
00:05:57.565,00:06:02.321,There was a delivery while you were in court.
00:06:02.403,00:06:04.489,Schweikart and Cokely sent this? What is it?
00:06:04.572,00:06:07.868,The served interrogatories on each class representative.
00:06:07.951,00:06:10.620,This box is deposition notices.
00:06:10.704,00:06:15.709,Documents calling into question the mental health of many of our elderly clients.
00:06:15.792,00:06:20.421,Attempting to stop the class from being certified on the grounds they're not competent.
00:06:20.505,00:06:22.924,"Oh, this is just the beginning."
00:06:23.008,00:06:27.054,They're gonna continue this document dump until we're drowning in paperwork.
00:06:27.137,00:06:30.349,All right. We can deal with this.
00:06:30.431,00:06:36.938,"I mean, hey. It's, uh-- It's just paperwork. Right?"
00:06:37.022,00:06:39.691,It's no big deal. Just hit it head on.
00:06:39.774,00:06:41.442,Jimmy. Prioritize.
00:06:41.526,00:06:43.362,The most important stuff first.
00:06:43.444,00:06:46.865,Or is it better to deal with the easy stuff?
00:06:46.948,00:06:49.659,"You know, get that off the decks."
00:06:49.743,00:06:53.538,"You tell me, Chuck. You just point to a box. We can do this."
00:06:53.621,00:06:56.208,"Jimmy, we need to talk. Chuck."
00:06:56.291,00:06:59.253,"Sit down, won't you? No, I'm good."
00:06:59.336,00:07:01.713,I know you're not gonna like what I have to say next.
00:07:03.631,00:07:06.093,And what we're facing here...
00:07:06.176,00:07:09.804,"A case this size, it is not a two man job. We need help."
00:07:09.888,00:07:14.601,"No. And for the good of the clients, we need to refer this case-- Don't say it."
00:07:14.684,00:07:16.519,Refer it out to HHM.
00:07:16.603,00:07:20.232,"Damn it, Chuck. No. Come on."
00:07:20.315,00:07:25.279,We can do this. We're doing great on our own.
00:07:29.324,00:07:32.535,We can Erin Brockovich the shit out of this case.
00:07:32.619,00:07:34.955,Erin Brockovich didn't do it alone.
00:07:35.038,00:07:40.001,She and Ed Masry brought in heavy hitters from Los Angeles to get that case across the goal line.
00:07:40.085,00:07:43.964,And that's what we need to do. And there's no shame in that.
00:07:44.047,00:07:45.673,This is our case.
00:07:45.757,00:07:47.008,"Yes, it's ours."
00:07:47.092,00:07:49.469,And the task ahead is monumental.
00:07:52.555,00:07:55.976,Could two men alone build the Brooklyn Bridge? Maybe.
00:07:56.059,00:07:58.478,But it would take forever.
00:08:03.191,00:08:09.156,Referring this case to HHM is for the good of the clients.
00:08:09.239,00:08:14.244,"That argument you won today against the restraining order, the judge was never gonna grant that."
00:08:14.328,00:08:16.746,Schweikart is throwing softballs.
00:08:16.830,00:08:19.499,And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.
00:08:19.582,00:08:23.086,"We'll be busy swatting them away, we'll never spend time on the actual case."
00:08:25.880,00:08:29.384,And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.
00:08:29.468,00:08:30.969,We simply don't.
00:08:42.189,00:08:45.442,Fine. So?
00:08:45.525,00:08:47.361,The case goes to HHM?
00:08:49.070,00:08:52.699,Hail Satan. I submit to the dark side.
00:08:54.326,00:08:56.911,I'll call Kim and arrange a meeting.
00:08:56.995,00:09:00.499,"All right. Good, Jimmy. Thank you."
00:09:00.581,00:09:03.460,I know you'll come to see that it's for the best.
00:09:15.930,00:09:19.976,I guess I'll have to get an office right next to yours.
00:09:21.895,00:09:24.689,"Finally out of the mailroom, huh?"
00:10:56.156,00:10:58.533,Yes. Hello.
00:10:58.617,00:11:01.578,No. It's me.
00:11:36.530,00:11:39.866,This the place where we wait? Think so.
00:12:11.772,00:12:13.274,So...
00:12:16.986,00:12:19.447,What'd our guy tell you about the job?
00:12:21.700,00:12:23.493,Not much.
00:12:37.840,00:12:39.133,You been doing this long?
00:12:39.217,00:12:41.469,I just assume we're all heavy hitters.
00:12:41.553,00:12:44.347,And it makes sense. The vet recommends the best of the best.
00:12:44.431,00:12:48.935,"Dealing with some of these ethnic types, blood tends to run a little hotter."
00:12:49.018,00:12:52.564,That's just science. Physiology.
00:12:52.647,00:12:56.234,There's historical precedent. Know what I'm saying?
00:12:57.611,00:13:00.739,"So, what you packing?"
00:13:02.156,00:13:05.326,"A pimento. Sorry, what?"
00:13:05.410,00:13:07.704,Pimento sandwich.
00:13:09.038,00:13:12.125,That's funny. Pimento.
00:13:14.001,00:13:15.754,"No, I mean, what are you carrying?"
00:13:15.836,00:13:18.047,"You know, the piece? What's the make?"
00:13:20.383,00:13:23.052,They call it the caviar of the south.
00:13:23.136,00:13:25.430,"You don't want to tell me what you're carrying, so be it."
00:13:25.513,00:13:28.224,But you don't have to be a douche about it.
00:13:28.308,00:13:30.727,Just told you what I'm carrying.
00:13:36.190,00:13:37.942,Is that what you're saying?
00:13:40.695,00:13:43.281,You have a gun? Yeah.
00:13:43.364,00:13:46.785,Yeah. Of course. He's got a gun.
00:13:46.867,00:13:49.412,I got at least two guns on me that I'll tell you about.
00:13:49.496,00:13:51.790,I go old school with a Wilson Combat 1911.
00:13:51.872,00:13:53.916,I got a Glock 22 Gen 3.
00:13:54.000,00:13:56.127,And those are just the ones I'll tell you about.
00:13:56.210,00:13:58.338,Mm.
00:13:58.421,00:14:01.758,"I mean, what the hell? Really?"
00:14:01.840,00:14:04.051,How do you not pack a gun?
00:14:25.198,00:14:28.117,"Um, actually, that's not my name."
00:14:28.201,00:14:31.037,"But, uh, I have a nephew named Price."
00:14:31.120,00:14:32.913,I've always kind of liked that name.
00:14:32.997,00:14:35.082,"Anyway, we're not dealing with names today."
00:14:35.166,00:14:36.793,You can tell me or not tell me yours.
00:14:36.876,00:14:38.211,Or a fake one is fine.
00:14:38.294,00:14:44.258,"Um, if I need to talk to you, I'd prefer something other than Hey, you."
00:14:44.342,00:14:47.136,"Either way, you all come highly recommended, so thank you."
00:14:47.220,00:14:50.390,"First order of business, we have a long drive ahead of us."
00:14:50.473,00:14:53.476,"Uh, I have a cooler of water in the car, some soft drinks."
00:14:53.560,00:14:57.480,"I don't drink coffee, but there is a diner on the corner."
00:14:57.564,00:15:02.485,Also a bathroom in there in case you need to go before we go.
00:15:02.569,00:15:04.738,"Second order. Uh, money."
00:15:12.829,00:15:14.789,"If that's acceptable-- Yeah, I have a thought."
00:15:14.873,00:15:16.499,Yeah.
00:15:16.583,00:15:20.127,How about you give me and Man Mountain 750 each?
00:15:20.211,00:15:23.631,And send Uncle Fester there home. He's not carrying a gun.
00:15:23.715,00:15:25.925,He's useless.
00:15:26.008,00:15:28.219,Is that true? You didn't bring a gun?
00:15:28.302,00:15:29.970,I didn't think I'd need one.
00:15:31.598,00:15:33.516,It's a protection job.
00:15:33.600,00:15:37.437,"It's basic common sense that you need a gun to protect your employer. I mean, duh."
00:15:37.520,00:15:38.938,You're dead weight.
00:15:39.021,00:15:40.815,He's just a third wheel without a piece.
00:15:40.899,00:15:42.149,I'll tell you what.
00:15:42.233,00:15:44.193,"If I need a gun, I'll use one of his."
00:15:44.277,00:15:45.904,Really? One of my guns?
00:15:45.986,00:15:48.489,How do you picture that happening exactly?
00:15:48.573,00:15:50.450,"Well, I guess I'm gonna take it from you."
00:15:50.533,00:15:54.788,That-- That is just special. Huh?
00:15:54.871,00:15:57.957,Take. How are you gonna take one of my guns?
00:15:58.040,00:16:01.168,"Come on, Billy Jackoff."
00:16:01.252,00:16:03.504,Take my gun from me.
00:16:03.588,00:16:05.256,Let me see it.
00:16:05.339,00:16:08.843,Here. I'll make it easy for you.
00:16:14.056,00:16:16.559,You can make it not so easy.
00:16:16.643,00:16:18.478,Sure thing.
00:16:20.229,00:16:21.731,You got it.
00:16:24.484,00:16:27.528,What the--? Son of a-- Unh!
00:16:29.989,00:16:33.660,Okay. Let's see what you got.
00:16:35.787,00:16:39.916,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A guy like you...
00:16:39.999,00:16:43.586,"I'll bet you'd have an ankle holster, wouldn't you?"
00:16:43.670,00:16:47.381,"You know, that's cute. What else?"
00:16:52.887,00:16:56.933,"Wow, now, that's impressive."
00:16:57.016,00:17:00.227,"So many guns, I don't know which one to use."
00:17:00.311,00:17:04.064,How about you? You want one?
00:17:10.864,00:17:12.239,All right.
00:17:25.252,00:17:26.754,Let's go.
00:17:26.838,00:17:28.297,But we need three guys.
00:17:28.381,00:17:31.467,"No. No, we don't. Come on. Let's go."
00:17:40.100,00:17:42.436,"Oh, he'll be fine."
00:17:42.520,00:17:48.442,"And now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full 1500. We agree upon that?"
00:17:48.526,00:17:49.986,Sure.
00:17:59.954,00:18:01.873,"JIMMY: You got this, okay? No problem."
00:18:01.956,00:18:03.457,Yes.
00:18:03.541,00:18:06.085,The suit okay? Is it too tight or too hot?
00:18:15.553,00:18:17.263,It was a good idea.
00:18:17.346,00:18:22.435,"Yeah. At any point, it's too much, you're uncomfortable, we'll turn around and come home."
00:18:22.518,00:18:24.645,"You want maybe, like, a safe word?"
00:18:24.729,00:18:27.065,How about get me the hell home?
00:18:27.189,00:18:29.525,That'll work. Okay.
00:18:29.609,00:18:31.569,Let's do this.
00:18:31.652,00:18:33.404,Let's do this.
00:18:36.323,00:18:38.743,JIMMY: Okay.
00:18:38.826,00:18:40.620,Looking good.
00:18:40.703,00:18:44.123,We're just going for a little ride.
00:18:46.125,00:18:48.586,Here. Let me get that for you.
00:18:49.712,00:18:51.338,Here you go.
00:19:00.222,00:19:02.934,CHUCK: Jimmy. Just a sec.
00:19:07.021,00:19:08.481,"Oh, crap."
00:19:08.564,00:19:10.190,What is it?
00:19:10.274,00:19:12.944,I must have left my stupid phone on last night. It's dead.
00:19:13.027,00:19:14.779,"Well, could you put it in the trunk?"
00:19:14.862,00:19:16.781,Oh. Yeah.
00:19:30.128,00:19:32.755,Okay. Thanks.
00:19:33.881,00:19:35.883,That everyone?
00:19:35.967,00:19:37.677,They'll be here in one minute.
00:19:41.639,00:19:44.266,Okay. Shut it down. Okay. You got it.
00:20:17.424,00:20:18.926,How you doing? You doing all right?
00:20:19.010,00:20:21.929,Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Great stuff.
00:20:32.106,00:20:34.483,Okay. We're walking.
00:20:34.567,00:20:36.276,"Walking in, Chuck."
00:20:37.611,00:20:39.113,Here we go.
00:21:03.303,00:21:04.805,Good to see you. Welcome home.
00:21:04.889,00:21:06.599,"Howard, you didn't need to do all this."
00:21:06.682,00:21:08.935,"Oh, I couldn't have stopped them if I wanted to."
00:21:09.018,00:21:10.978,"Come on, let's get you upstairs. Yeah. Sure."
00:21:11.062,00:21:13.856,"Francis. Brenda. Jose, you shaved."
00:21:25.118,00:21:34.418,"To date, we have 68 very willing plaintiffs signed to the class action, with the hopes of raising that number to 350 or more."
00:21:34.501,00:21:38.422,"Many more, now that we know Sandpiper has facilities in five states."
00:21:38.505,00:21:43.385,"Fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and racketeering."
00:21:43.469,00:21:45.805,"Jesus. Heh, heh. Guys, this is..."
00:21:47.140,00:21:49.767,"Well, no case is ever a slam dunk."
00:21:49.850,00:21:53.562,But I feel as confident about this as anything that's come through our doors.
00:21:53.646,00:21:56.232,"Francis, start putting together teams to travel out of state."
00:21:56.315,00:21:57.566,Talk to these residents.
00:21:57.650,00:21:59.318,Pair fourths with our best second years.
00:21:59.401,00:22:01.112,Laura will take care of the arrangements.
00:22:01.195,00:22:03.572,"Kim, Daniel. Take the list of clients Jimmy's signed."
00:22:03.656,00:22:05.241,Introduce yourself as the face of HHM.
00:22:05.324,00:22:07.701,Make them feel secure and confident.
00:22:07.785,00:22:09.912,"Hey, Howard. I'm glad you're all excited."
00:22:09.996,00:22:13.749,"But can we slow down a second and discuss terms, maybe?"
00:22:13.833,00:22:16.294,"Oh, of course. Kind of shot out of a cannon with this case."
00:22:16.376,00:22:17.837,It's exciting stuff you have here.
00:22:17.920,00:22:19.255,I get it.
00:22:19.338,00:22:21.174,"Look, Chuck is already an equity partner."
00:22:21.257,00:22:29.765,"You, as the lawyer who brought this case to the firm, we could guarantee you, say, 20 percent of the common fund share of the final settlement."
00:22:29.849,00:22:32.143,That will work.
00:22:32.226,00:22:33.853,That's a few years down the road.
00:22:33.936,00:22:39.108,"As for money for you now, uh, we don't do referral fees. Chuck will agree."
00:22:39.192,00:22:40.776,HHM doesn't view that as ethical.
00:22:40.860,00:22:42.236,As we discussed.
00:22:42.320,00:22:47.074,But what we could do is arrange an of-counsel fee for the time that you've already put in.
00:22:47.158,00:22:49.702,Time that you spent building the case.
00:22:49.785,00:22:51.829,"I think we could go as high as 20,000."
00:22:51.912,00:22:56.792,"That, too, will work. Great."
00:22:56.876,00:22:59.170,Give us an invoice. I'll have Helen cut you a check.
00:22:59.253,00:23:00.713,"Oh, got it right here."
00:23:00.796,00:23:04.508,And I'd like to use 312 as an office.
00:23:04.591,00:23:07.928,It's right next to Chuck's. I'm sorry?
00:23:08.012,00:23:12.058,"Three-twelve. I know, it's got that view that clients love, but you know what?"
00:23:12.141,00:23:13.559,That's a waste of space.
00:23:13.642,00:23:17.104,The waiting area by the kitchen is just as good.
00:23:18.396,00:23:19.815,Um...
00:23:19.899,00:23:22.902,"Well, come on, guys. I mean, I need an office."
00:23:25.363,00:23:27.698,"Can I have the room? Everybody, please."
00:23:27.781,00:23:29.200,Just give us a few.
00:23:33.371,00:23:36.582,"Um, Howard-- When the room's clear, Chuck."
00:23:45.925,00:23:49.511,"Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it."
00:23:49.595,00:23:52.639,You're not working here. What are you talking about?
00:23:52.723,00:23:54.225,You said this case is a slam dunk.
00:23:54.308,00:23:56.643,Yes. We want the case.
00:23:59.355,00:24:00.856,Uh...
00:24:00.940,00:24:04.151,The case is all we want.
00:24:09.282,00:24:10.699,You're serious?
00:24:10.783,00:24:19.499,I walk in here with a multi-million dollar class action lawsuit on a damn platinum platter.
00:24:19.583,00:24:23.837,"A case that I found, that I made happen."
00:24:23.921,00:24:28.675,And you don't want me? Why in Christ not?
00:24:30.552,00:24:34.640,"You better believe, feeling goes both ways."
00:24:34.723,00:24:38.476,But I'm willing to set that aside to work with you on this.
00:24:38.560,00:24:40.562,Why can't you do the same for me?
00:24:40.646,00:24:44.317,What is it that you can't let go of? Huh?
00:24:44.400,00:24:49.780,"What slight did I make to your fine, upstanding character that you can't forgive?"
00:24:49.863,00:24:52.866,A majority decision has been made by myself and the partners.
00:24:52.950,00:24:57.495,"All due respect to you, Chuck, we are not taking in any new associates into the firm."
00:24:57.579,00:24:59.415,Bullshit! New associates?
00:24:59.497,00:25:04.295,"Someone walks in with a case like this, you beg them to be partner."
00:25:04.378,00:25:06.297,Tell me why.
00:25:06.380,00:25:08.757,You didn't want me then. Okay.
00:25:10.134,00:25:11.885,Explain it.
00:25:13.429,00:25:14.763,CHUCK: Howard.
00:25:16.307,00:25:19.143,I don't know what to say.
00:25:19.226,00:25:21.228,I am very disappointed.
00:25:21.312,00:25:23.105,I really think you should reconsider.
00:25:23.189,00:25:28.027,"I'm sorry, but no. I think it's best if Jimmy takes the of-counsel fee."
00:25:28.110,00:25:29.820,We could probably up it a bit. Keep in mind.
00:25:29.903,00:25:31.780,You will be well-compensated in the back end.
00:25:31.864,00:25:33.324,"It's easy money, Jimmy."
00:25:33.407,00:25:35.909,No reason not to take it.
00:25:38.829,00:25:40.956,I'm not giving you my case.
00:25:41.040,00:25:48.339,And I'm gonna tell every one of those clients what a lying miserable pig fucker you are.
00:25:48.422,00:25:53.677,I will burn the whole thing to the ground before I give it to you.
00:25:55.846,00:25:59.725,"Okay, then, if that's your decision."
00:26:08.984,00:26:10.152,Oh...
00:26:13.072,00:26:15.366,What the hell just happened?
00:26:19.953,00:26:21.205,Yeah. Come.
00:26:22.831,00:26:24.375,Hi.
00:26:24.458,00:26:28.546,Was wondering if you had a moment?
00:26:28.628,00:26:31.507,Sure. Just give me a second.
00:26:43.977,00:26:45.438,What's up?
00:26:45.521,00:26:48.482,I wanted to talk about what happened today.
00:26:48.566,00:26:51.193,"With Sandpiper Crossing, things didn't work out."
00:26:51.277,00:26:52.861,It was unfortunate. It was a good case.
00:26:52.945,00:26:55.448,But... things happen.
00:26:55.531,00:26:57.741,KIM: I'm just trying to understand why.
00:26:57.824,00:27:00.369,Jimmy found that case. He built it.
00:27:00.453,00:27:03.080,Did all of the leg work.
00:27:03.163,00:27:05.124,The class action doesn't exist without him.
00:27:05.207,00:27:07.084,He deserves a seat at the table.
00:27:07.167,00:27:08.919,I understand.
00:27:09.002,00:27:11.505,"But the decision has been made, Kim."
00:27:11.589,00:27:15.842,So... thank you for your input.
00:27:21.265,00:27:23.892,But... why?
00:27:27.187,00:27:32.901,The partners have made a decision and the why is not your concern.
00:27:32.985,00:27:35.362,I think it is my concern.
00:27:35.446,00:27:37.281,And why is that?
00:27:39.408,00:27:42.244,Because he's my friend.
00:27:42.328,00:27:45.456,"And the way I see it, you're not treating him fairly."
00:27:45.539,00:27:47.583,The way you see it?
00:27:47.665,00:27:58.385,"I don't know what image you have of him, past or present, or whatever he did or said, but Jimmy is a good lawyer."
00:27:58.469,00:28:00.220,And he works very hard.
00:28:00.304,00:28:03.390,Did your friend send you in here to say that?
00:28:04.850,00:28:06.768,No.
00:28:11.273,00:28:14.276,"Well, duly noted."
00:28:14.360,00:28:16.903,Want to know what I believe?
00:28:16.987,00:28:21.200,I believe that you're way out of your depth in this matter.
00:28:21.283,00:28:28.748,"So the next time that you want to come in here and tell me what I'm doing wrong, you are welcome to keep it to yourself."
00:28:28.832,00:28:31.293,Because I don't care.
00:28:42.137,00:28:43.347,Stop.
00:28:48.352,00:28:50.312,Close the door.
00:29:00.822,00:29:02.741,They're late.
00:29:02.824,00:29:04.784,Must be traffic.
00:29:08.664,00:29:10.957,I wonder how this is supposed to work.
00:29:11.041,00:29:16.422,"I mean, who goes first? Do I hand over the pills first?"
00:29:16.505,00:29:20.800,Or do they give me the money and then I hand over the pills?
00:29:20.884,00:29:28.141,"I mean, I guess it makes sense if we just exchanged at the same time, right? I mean, that's fair."
00:29:28.225,00:29:31.186,Maybe we just count to three.
00:29:31.270,00:29:33.564,"Probably the less talk, the better."
00:29:33.647,00:29:35.357,Right.
00:29:35.441,00:29:39.945,Yeah. I suppose you could really overthink something like this.
00:29:40.028,00:29:41.363,Yeah.
00:29:41.447,00:29:44.866,"Well, in any case-- Here is what is going to happen."
00:29:44.950,00:29:47.869,You're gonna take the money. You're going to count it.
00:29:47.953,00:29:51.164,"If it's all there, you hand them the pills."
00:29:51.248,00:29:53.166,Easy peasy.
00:30:07.598,00:30:12.269,I knew we needed three guys. I knew it. It's a three-man job.
00:30:12.352,00:30:13.937,God.
00:30:30.954,00:30:33.666,Hello. Hi.
00:30:36.084,00:30:38.962,Do you have it? I do.
00:30:41.173,00:30:43.133,Do you have the money?
00:31:15.749,00:31:17.167,Is it all there?
00:31:18.669,00:31:20.754,Um...
00:31:20.838,00:31:25.258,We're short 20. Twenty dollars.
00:31:25.342,00:31:27.010,That's fine.
00:31:28.595,00:31:31.765,Agreed amount or no deal.
00:31:33.183,00:31:34.601,You serious?
00:31:34.685,00:31:37.688,You saying I intentionally shorted you?
00:31:37.771,00:31:41.233,No. Mistakes happen.
00:31:41.316,00:31:44.444,You really willing to blow up this deal over 20 bucks?
00:31:45.612,00:31:47.865,Are you?
00:32:13.306,00:32:16.602,"It's all there. Eighty milligram pills, still factory sealed."
00:33:00.604,00:33:02.606,You can pay me now.
00:33:02.689,00:33:04.357,Huh?
00:33:04.441,00:33:05.818,Oh.
00:33:16.536,00:33:19.539,How did you know? Huh?
00:33:19.623,00:33:22.668,How did you know not to bring a gun?
00:33:22.751,00:33:26.922,"This 1500, I'll just say you're getting a bargain."
00:33:27.005,00:33:29.967,I put in a lot of leg work before coming here.
00:33:30.049,00:33:33.971,"Now, that fella you just met with, name is Ignacio Varga."
00:33:34.053,00:33:36.932,He runs with a connected crew of drug dealers.
00:33:37.015,00:33:39.643,"This deal he's doing with you, he's doing outside his crew."
00:33:45.899,00:33:49.152,Wow. Hm.
00:33:49.235,00:33:52.155,"The lesson is, if you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework."
00:33:52.238,00:33:54.574,Wait. I'm not a bad guy.
00:33:54.658,00:33:57.577,I didn't say you were a bad guy. I said you're a criminal.
00:33:58.871,00:34:00.789,What's the difference?
00:34:00.873,00:34:03.416,I've known good criminals and bad cops.
00:34:03.500,00:34:05.210,Bad priests. Honorable thieves.
00:34:05.293,00:34:08.964,You can be on one side of the law or the other.
00:34:09.047,00:34:13.301,"But if you make a deal with somebody, you keep your word."
00:34:13.385,00:34:18.223,You can go home today with your money and never do this again.
00:34:21.142,00:34:23.520,And you sold it for a profit.
00:34:23.603,00:34:26.398,"You're now a criminal. Good one, bad one?"
00:34:26.481,00:34:28.441,That's up to you.
00:34:30.861,00:34:33.154,I can get more pills.
00:34:33.238,00:34:36.992,And I am sure that fella will keep buying.
00:34:40.286,00:34:41.538,Why don't you get us home?
00:34:41.621,00:34:44.249,You can sleep on it before you decide.
00:35:27.960,00:35:30.712,Hey. Hey.
00:35:30.796,00:35:32.505,I was worried about you.
00:35:32.589,00:35:34.758,I must have called a dozen times.
00:35:34.841,00:35:36.635,Sorry. My phone died.
00:35:36.718,00:35:38.595,It's one of the perks of living in Chuckland.
00:35:38.678,00:35:39.888,Nowhere to plug in.
00:35:43.516,00:35:47.145,I've got gin. I've got tequila. I've got good Kentucky bourbon.
00:35:47.228,00:35:51.190,And you may partake with me in any beverage of your choice on one condition.
00:35:51.274,00:35:55.695,You have to listen to me rant about what an absolute unwashed asshole your boss is.
00:35:55.779,00:35:58.239,Jimmy-- No. It's true.
00:35:58.323,00:36:03.787,Don't deny it. He has reached a level of douche baggery that will live on for generations.
00:36:03.870,00:36:07.624,Passed down by windtalkers and the like.
00:36:07.707,00:36:11.169,He'd rather tank a multi-million dollar case than work with me.
00:36:11.252,00:36:14.297,That's sick. He has a sickness.
00:36:14.380,00:36:17.634,He hates me that much? I hate him more.
00:36:17.717,00:36:19.886,What you drinking? Jimmy.
00:36:19.970,00:36:24.474,"Yeah, I wanna grab him by that stupid knit tie of his and swing him around."
00:36:24.557,00:36:26.184,Jimmy-- Hamlindigo blue.
00:36:26.267,00:36:29.437,How about hamlindigo blow me? Jimmy!
00:36:29.521,00:36:31.815,I think you should take the deal.
00:36:33.900,00:36:35.318,What?
00:36:35.401,00:36:39.865,I think you should slow down and think about it.
00:36:39.948,00:36:44.953,Because taking the deal really is the best thing for you.
00:36:45.037,00:36:49.415,"You'll find yourself a proper office, your office."
00:36:49.499,00:36:50.834,You'll build your practice.
00:36:50.917,00:36:54.713,You'll leave Hamlin and HHM behind.
00:36:54.796,00:36:57.049,Be your own man.
00:36:59.134,00:37:01.887,You want me to give up the case?
00:37:01.970,00:37:03.138,My case?
00:37:03.221,00:37:04.848,I want you...
00:37:04.931,00:37:06.683,to be happy.
00:37:06.766,00:37:09.895,"And I know you want to stay with the case, but..."
00:37:09.978,00:37:13.773,you'll get all the financial reward without the risk.
00:37:13.857,00:37:15.358,How can that be bad?
00:37:15.441,00:37:18.904,You come here peddling that horseshit on me?
00:37:18.987,00:37:20.655,"God, you?"
00:37:20.739,00:37:22.699,"You sure know where your bread is buttered, huh?"
00:37:22.782,00:37:24.576,"Don't wanna go up against the boss, that it?"
00:37:24.659,00:37:28.496,You're like a-- You're like a damn pod person.
00:37:29.789,00:37:31.124,What did Hamlin promise you?
00:37:31.208,00:37:34.044,Please tell me he didn't buy you off cheap.
00:37:34.127,00:37:36.337,Did he promise you the office I asked for?
00:37:36.421,00:37:39.382,Or did he just swear never to move you back downstairs?
00:37:41.801,00:37:43.845,Take the deal.
00:38:17.796,00:38:20.339,"Oh, son of a bitch."
00:39:22.861,00:39:25.655,Oh. Jimmy.
00:39:25.738,00:39:28.200,"Hey. Jesus, when did you come in?"
00:39:28.283,00:39:32.578,I don't know. I left my watch outside.
00:39:32.662,00:39:36.499,Maybe an hour ago. You doing some ironing?
00:39:36.582,00:39:37.959,Yeah.
00:39:40.128,00:39:44.549,"Hey, I know things didn't go well for us yesterday."
00:39:52.015,00:39:56.644,"And the space blanket lining in the suit, what a fantastic idea."
00:39:56.728,00:40:00.732,It really made being outside much more tolerable.
00:40:00.815,00:40:04.944,"I'm thinking about taking a little walk around the block later on. Ha, ha."
00:40:05.028,00:40:07.864,"That's great, Chuck. You should do that."
00:40:10.658,00:40:14.162,"Jimmy, are you all right?"
00:40:14.246,00:40:17.749,"Well, I didn't sleep last night, so..."
00:40:17.832,00:40:23.046,"I was doing some soul searching, and I came to a decision."
00:40:23.129,00:40:25.882,I'm gonna take that deal.
00:40:25.965,00:40:30.011,You're sure? This is what you want?
00:40:32.347,00:40:34.515,Kim talked to me.
00:40:34.599,00:40:37.227,I got pretty nasty. I'm not proud.
00:40:37.310,00:40:43.275,"But thinking about what she said, I'd be a fool to pass up that money."
00:40:43.358,00:40:45.526,It is a lot of money.
00:40:47.404,00:40:50.073,And I have zero interest in working with Howard.
00:40:50.156,00:40:54.577,So it's probably best that we keep to our separate sandboxes.
00:40:54.660,00:40:58.290,"Wish it could have worked out. Yeah. Imagine that, huh?"
00:40:59.958,00:41:03.836,The two McGill boys side by side storming the gates.
00:41:03.920,00:41:06.547,"Righting wrongs, taking down the bad guys."
00:41:06.631,00:41:08.466,And making a boatload of money to boot.
00:41:08.549,00:41:10.176,That would have been great.
00:41:10.260,00:41:13.221,Right? The very best.
00:41:13.305,00:41:16.141,Yeah. Yeah. Heh.
00:41:17.600,00:41:21.020,I'll keep on Howard. Um...
00:41:21.104,00:41:25.191,"Won't badger him, but maybe I can gradually wear him down."
00:41:25.275,00:41:29.404,Get him to come around. That's-- Thanks.
00:41:29.487,00:41:33.325,Wow. I'm so lucky to have you looking out for me.
00:41:33.408,00:41:35.868,I'll do what I can. I'm not promising anything.
00:41:35.952,00:41:38.455,I get it. It's a long shot.
00:41:38.537,00:41:40.290,"Hey, he might change his mind."
00:41:40.373,00:41:42.125,Yeah?
00:41:42.208,00:41:48.673,"Hey, maybe there is a way that you could get Howard to change his mind."
00:41:48.756,00:41:50.925,How? Quit.
00:41:56.555,00:41:58.057,We've already been through all this.
00:41:58.141,00:42:00.352,The reasons I'm never gonna leave HHM.
00:42:00.435,00:42:02.812,But you don't have to really quit.
00:42:02.895,00:42:05.523,"Okay? You just threaten to quit, right?"
00:42:05.606,00:42:08.901,You get in a game of chicken with Howard.
00:42:11.529,00:42:13.531,It's a perfect plan. Heh.
00:42:13.614,00:42:17.160,Jimmy-- If you want us working together.
00:42:17.243,00:42:20.621,Ahem. You can make it happen easily.
00:42:20.705,00:42:28.587,"I mean, hey, that reception you got yesterday at HHM, how about that, right? The whole lobby of HHM applauding for you."
00:42:28.671,00:42:30.673,They love you.
00:42:30.756,00:42:35.553,"Now, you threaten to pull out, Hamlin would be insane to screw with you."
00:42:35.636,00:42:39.098,You've got the nuclear option. Launch the doomsday device.
00:42:39.182,00:42:45.897,"Game over. If working with me is what you really want, right, Chuck?"
00:42:48.358,00:42:50.693,You called him.
00:42:50.776,00:42:53.654,You called Hamlin.
00:42:53.738,00:42:57.575,I always turn my phone off before I put it in your mailbox.
00:42:57.658,00:43:02.038,"Two nights ago, it was left on. Battery drained."
00:43:02.121,00:43:05.750,"I was so damn sure that I turned it off, you know."
00:43:05.833,00:43:08.169,"Because I always do. It's a habit, right? Heh."
00:43:08.253,00:43:10.171,So it was nagging me. It was nagging me.
00:43:10.255,00:43:12.340,So I called the phone company.
00:43:12.424,00:43:16.635,Turns out there was a deleted call at 2 a.m.
00:43:16.719,00:43:18.888,when I was asleep right there.
00:43:20.639,00:43:23.768,And you know whose number? Hamlin's.
00:43:25.644,00:43:31.692,"The only person who could have made that call and deleted it is you, Chuck."
00:43:33.736,00:43:35.988,"Boy, that phone, huh?"
00:43:36.072,00:43:38.991,Phone must have felt like a blowtorch in your ear.
00:43:39.075,00:43:40.826,All that electricity.
00:43:40.910,00:43:43.746,All those radio waves right up against the side of your head.
00:43:43.829,00:43:46.165,My God.
00:43:46.249,00:43:50.545,What was so important that you had to call Howard before our meeting?
00:43:50.628,00:43:58.010,The only thing I can think-- The only thing that makes sense is you told him not to hire me.
00:43:58.094,00:44:01.306,"It was always you, right?"
00:44:01.389,00:44:08.313,Right back to when I passed the bar and tried to join the firm. You didn't want me.
00:44:08.396,00:44:09.939,Speak up.
00:44:10.022,00:44:13.067,Tell me why.
00:44:13.151,00:44:15.111,It's the least you can do for me now.
00:44:15.194,00:44:16.613,I'm your brother.
00:44:16.695,00:44:19.324,We're supposed to look out for each other.
00:44:19.407,00:44:22.743,"Why were you working against me, Chuck?"
00:44:24.829,00:44:27.915,You're not a real lawyer.
00:44:27.999,00:44:29.250,I'm what?
00:44:29.334,00:44:32.504,You're not a real lawyer.
00:44:32.587,00:44:35.756,"University of American Samoa, for Christ's sake."
00:44:35.840,00:44:38.717,An online course? What a joke.
00:44:38.801,00:44:41.137,I worked my ass off to get where I am.
00:44:41.220,00:44:44.516,And you take these shortcuts and you think suddenly you're my peer?
00:44:44.599,00:44:47.477,You do what I do because you're funny and you can make people laugh?
00:44:47.560,00:44:50.980,I committed my life to this!
00:44:51.063,00:44:56.319,You don't slide into it like a cheap pair of slippers and reap all the rewards.
00:44:56.402,00:44:58.070,I thought you were proud of me.
00:44:58.154,00:44:59.947,I was.
00:45:00.031,00:45:03.700,"When you straightened out and got a job in the mailroom, I was very proud."
00:45:03.784,00:45:05.453,"So that's it then, right?"
00:45:05.537,00:45:07.163,Keep old Jimmy down in the mailroom.
00:45:07.246,00:45:10.166,He's not good enough to be a lawyer.
00:45:10.249,00:45:12.544,I know you.
00:45:12.627,00:45:14.587,"I know what you were, what you are."
00:45:14.671,00:45:17.507,People don't change. You're Slippin' Jimmy.
00:45:17.590,00:45:19.551,And Slippin' Jimmy I can handle just fine.
00:45:19.634,00:45:23.262,But Slippin' Jimmy with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun.
00:45:23.346,00:45:25.764,The law is sacred!
00:45:25.848,00:45:28.309,"If you abuse that power, people get hurt."
00:45:28.393,00:45:30.811,This is not a game.
00:45:30.895,00:45:34.899,"You have to know-- On some level, I know you know I'm right."
00:45:34.982,00:45:36.484,You know I'm right.
00:45:44.701,00:45:47.412,I...
00:45:47.495,00:45:50.415,I got you a 20-pound bag of ice.
00:45:50.498,00:45:56.379,"And some bacon, and some eggs, and a couple of those steaks that you like."
00:45:56.462,00:45:59.424,Some fuel canisters. It's enough for three or four days.
00:45:59.507,00:46:03.760,"After that, you're on your own."
00:46:04.929,00:46:06.889,I am done.
00:46:08.266,00:46:10.851,Jimmy.
00:46:10.935,00:46:12.562,Jimmy.
00:46:22.154,00:46:23.740,Jimmy.
00:46:25.157,00:46:27.326,"Jimmy, come back inside."
00:46:31.788,00:46:34.375,Jimmy.
00:46:34.459,00:46:36.168,Jimmy.
00:00:26.234,00:00:28.570,Jesus.
00:00:30.113,00:00:32.240,MAN: You sure about that?
00:00:32.324,00:00:35.870,"Ah. There's a trick, huh? There's gotta be."
00:00:35.953,00:00:38.372,This guy wouldn't put money on it unless there's a trick.
00:00:38.455,00:00:41.542,"PIERCE: I'm telling you, it can't be done."
00:00:41.625,00:00:43.377,So you give up?
00:00:45.128,00:00:47.297,Yeah. All right.
00:00:51.050,00:00:52.928,Let's see it.
00:00:58.017,00:01:00.644,"Oh, oh-- Wait, what? No way."
00:01:00.728,00:01:02.604,Show me that again.
00:01:02.688,00:01:05.774,Sure. You got another 20? Ahh.
00:01:05.858,00:01:07.026,Screw this.
00:01:08.527,00:01:10.696,"MAN: Ah, don't go away mad."
00:01:10.779,00:01:13.782,"Oh, hey, guys. You wanna buy a Rolex?"
00:01:17.118,00:01:18.996,Look what the wind blew in. Hey.
00:01:19.079,00:01:23.458,"Holy crap. Jimmy, my man. I said you would beat the rap."
00:01:23.542,00:01:25.627,"Hey, Merna. Set him up. No thanks. I'm good."
00:01:25.711,00:01:26.962,"No, go on. He don't mean it."
00:01:27.046,00:01:28.756,You just got out of jail. Come on.
00:01:28.839,00:01:31.216,You're not gonna have a drink? That'll be the day.
00:01:31.299,00:01:34.093,Settle down. I'm in a rush. My brother's outside in a taxi.
00:01:34.177,00:01:36.304,"The meter's running. What, Chuck's outside?"
00:01:36.388,00:01:39.433,Tell him to pull that broomstick out of his ass and get in here.
00:01:39.516,00:01:41.643,No. We got no time. We're catching a plane.
00:01:41.727,00:01:43.437,I came here to say goodbye.
00:01:43.520,00:01:46.690,"I'm moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico."
00:01:46.774,00:01:48.442,Mexico? You skip bail?
00:01:48.525,00:01:52.195,"New Mexico. You know, like Bugs Bunny and the Road Runner."
00:01:52.279,00:01:53.948,"Okay, yeah. What are you gonna do there?"
00:01:54.031,00:01:56.241,"I'm gonna work at his law firm, like, in the mailroom."
00:01:58.118,00:02:00.662,Now you're talking crazy. You just got out of jail.
00:02:00.746,00:02:02.122,Now you wanna go back?
00:02:02.205,00:02:04.499,"Working for him, that's all that is."
00:02:04.583,00:02:06.126,Marco.
00:02:06.209,00:02:08.963,"I was done, you understand? I didn't beat the rap."
00:02:09.046,00:02:13.258,Chuck flew in and saved my ass. It's time to make some changes.
00:02:13.341,00:02:16.637,Hey. Listen to me. You're Slippin' Jimmy.
00:02:18.472,00:02:21.683,Everything. It's time to grow up.
00:02:21.767,00:02:25.186,"Yeah, according to who? Chuck? The same goes for you, man."
00:02:25.270,00:02:28.565,You want to spend the rest of your life on that stool?
00:02:28.649,00:02:30.525,"I mean, come on, Marco. Look at yourself."
00:02:31.944,00:02:35.030,"All right, that's him. I gotta hit it."
00:02:35.114,00:02:38.033,Jeez. His master's voice. Really?
00:02:38.117,00:02:39.743,Come on. Go outside.
00:02:39.827,00:02:42.579,Tell Chuckles that you got some business you forgot.
00:02:42.663,00:02:43.831,Marco. Come on.
00:02:43.914,00:02:46.041,You gotta have one last blowout.
00:02:46.125,00:02:47.751,We'll do the watch thing again.
00:02:47.835,00:02:52.506,But maybe we'll pull that tar-money scam you were talking about. Get some girls.
00:02:52.589,00:02:54.716,"I made a promise. Yeah, you made a promise."
00:02:54.800,00:02:57.636,But it was-- What do you call it? --under duress.
00:02:57.719,00:03:01.306,"Look, he got you out of jail, okay? But he's your brother."
00:03:01.389,00:03:02.975,"I mean, what else is he gonna do?"
00:03:03.058,00:03:04.518,"Marco. Listen to me, all right?"
00:03:04.601,00:03:06.227,Chuck's not making me do this.
00:03:06.311,00:03:10.398,He's giving me an opportunity and I'm grabbing it.
00:03:10.482,00:03:14.820,"Gee, it's like watching Miles Davis give up the trumpet."
00:03:14.903,00:03:17.614,What? What does that even mean?
00:03:17.698,00:03:19.240,"It's just a waste, is all I'm saying."
00:03:20.951,00:03:23.328,"Look, I'm gonna fly out there. I'm gonna get settled."
00:03:23.411,00:03:25.956,"And I'll call you, okay?"
00:03:26.040,00:03:28.042,"MARCO: All right, Jimmy."
00:03:28.125,00:03:32.379,"Hey, have a safe flight, all right?"
00:04:31.105,00:04:32.856,Hey.
00:04:32.940,00:04:34.816,Hey.
00:04:34.900,00:04:37.402,What's up?
00:04:37.485,00:04:39.780,Just waiting to talk to Howard.
00:04:39.863,00:04:43.117,Can I ask about what?
00:04:43.200,00:04:48.122,I'm taking your advice. I'm giving the case to HHM.
00:04:48.205,00:04:50.540,Why?
00:04:50.624,00:04:54.753,The fact that Chuck doesn't want me here has something to do with it.
00:04:57.965,00:04:59.258,I'm so sorry.
00:05:01.135,00:05:03.511,Why didn't you just tell me? I just...
00:05:05.305,00:05:07.933,I didn't want you hating your own brother.
00:05:11.561,00:05:15.607,HOWARD: How'd you find out? Did Kim tell you?
00:05:15.690,00:05:18.318,I figured it out on my own.
00:05:18.401,00:05:21.238,"It's about time, right?"
00:05:21.321,00:05:25.242,I brought the Sandpiper stuff with me. It's down in my car.
00:05:25.325,00:05:27.995,I figure your guys could do the outreach.
00:05:28.078,00:05:34.042,"If any of those geezers don't wanna sign with you, just give me their names, I'll talk them into it."
00:05:34.126,00:05:38.797,"You know, Jimmy, I never wanted it to go this way."
00:05:38.880,00:05:42.592,"If it had been up to me, we would have-- Howard, I get it."
00:05:44.303,00:05:47.222,Your brother's very important to the firm.
00:05:47.306,00:05:49.141,Sorry I called you a pig fucker.
00:05:49.224,00:05:51.350,Well...
00:05:52.936,00:05:56.023,"We owe you some money, don't we?"
00:05:56.106,00:05:58.275,The of-counsel fee.
00:05:58.357,00:06:00.861,"I think we discussed 20,000."
00:06:00.944,00:06:06.616,"That and whatever the common-fund proceeds of Sandpiper ultimately adds up to, you'll receive 20 percent of that."
00:06:06.700,00:06:09.328,Should be a very nice payday for you when it comes.
00:06:09.410,00:06:11.330,Yep.
00:06:11.412,00:06:13.874,I've got something for you too.
00:06:13.957,00:06:16.710,It's a shopping list for Chuck.
00:06:16.793,00:06:19.587,"He's doing better, but he still needs deliveries every day."
00:06:19.671,00:06:23.091,I think he'd be more comfortable with someone else doing it.
00:06:23.175,00:06:24.509,I see.
00:06:24.592,00:06:25.969,You don't have to do it personally.
00:06:26.053,00:06:28.013,It just needs to get done.
00:06:28.096,00:06:31.350,It's pretty straightforward. The ice is a pain in the ass.
00:06:31.432,00:06:33.352,But he needs it.
00:06:33.434,00:06:35.812,I usually sneak into a motel and fill a garbage bag.
00:06:35.896,00:06:39.900,But you can have whoever you hire just buy it.
00:06:39.983,00:06:42.319,Most important thing is the newspapers.
00:06:42.401,00:06:45.364,The New York Times. The Wall Street Journal. They're a must.
00:06:45.446,00:06:48.783,There's a newsstand on Eubank that has both of them at 6 a.m.
00:06:48.867,00:06:50.285,Which is good. He's an early riser.
00:06:50.369,00:06:52.246,The Albuquerque Journal gets delivered.
00:06:54.915,00:06:58.335,You've been doing all of this every day?
00:06:58.417,00:07:01.546,For over a year?
00:07:05.300,00:07:07.302,I'll get it done and done right.
00:07:15.018,00:07:18.646,Remember? I used to call you Charlie Hustle.
00:07:18.730,00:07:22.234,"Yeah, I remember that."
00:07:33.536,00:07:36.539,JIMMY: I'm sorry I yelled at you.
00:07:44.464,00:07:47.175,That was nice.
00:07:47.259,00:07:49.303,You sure you're all right?
00:07:49.386,00:07:53.014,It's not a crime to let it out. There's nothing to let out.
00:07:53.098,00:07:55.392,Chuck's a sick man.
00:07:55.475,00:07:57.685,That's no excuse.
00:07:57.769,00:08:00.605,He's my brother. He thinks I'm a scumbag.
00:08:03.442,00:08:06.778,What else is there to say?
00:08:06.861,00:08:09.239,"Wow, that's mature."
00:08:09.323,00:08:11.532,Dalai Lama's got nothing on me.
00:08:29.509,00:08:31.928,O-64.
00:08:32.012,00:08:37.934,"All right. Next up, we got N-32."
00:08:38.018,00:08:43.648,"N as in Nancy Reagan, First Lady with a lot of style."
00:08:43.731,00:08:46.067,Anybody else seen Hellcats of the Navy?
00:08:46.151,00:08:49.863,All right. No winners yet?
00:08:49.946,00:08:54.575,Okay. Here's B-2.
00:08:57.578,00:09:00.415,Probably one taking off over at Kirtland right now.
00:09:00.499,00:09:04.336,We would never know because it's stealthy.
00:09:04.419,00:09:06.671,Still no winners?
00:09:06.754,00:09:08.589,No?
00:09:08.673,00:09:11.009,Here we have...
00:09:11.092,00:09:20.477,"B-4. Another B. How about that. As in: Before too long, we're gonna have another winner."
00:09:21.769,00:09:24.022,No? Nobody? Okay.
00:09:25.606,00:09:27.108,All right. Ahem.
00:09:27.192,00:09:36.826,"And here comes-- Hey, it's our old friend B. Heh. B-12."
00:09:39.079,00:09:42.749,"B as in, uh..."
00:09:42.832,00:09:45.960,B as in...
00:09:46.044,00:09:48.046,betrayal.
00:09:48.129,00:09:53.260,Benedict Arnold betrayed the United States.
00:09:54.386,00:09:55.554,Still no winners?
00:09:56.888,00:09:58.681,No?
00:09:58.765,00:10:01.393,Okay.
00:10:01.476,00:10:03.770,Here it is.
00:10:06.606,00:10:09.067,"Oh, what are the odds?"
00:10:09.150,00:10:13.696,Four B's in a row. That's... Heh.
00:10:13.780,00:10:16.616,B-7.
00:10:16.699,00:10:18.701,B as in...
00:10:20.537,00:10:22.663,B as in...
00:10:22.747,00:10:24.749,brother.
00:10:24.832,00:10:26.626,Brother.
00:10:28.462,00:10:31.756,B-7. Seven brides for seven brothers.
00:10:31.839,00:10:33.592,I'm sure a lot of you have brothers.
00:10:33.674,00:10:35.302,It's not like mine though.
00:10:35.385,00:10:40.265,"Any winners yet? Take another look, okay? I'll wait."
00:10:40.348,00:10:44.811,"I'm gonna say if it's another B, we could have a real problem here."
00:10:52.277,00:10:53.987,And...
00:10:54.070,00:10:57.365,"Hey, it is another B."
00:10:58.575,00:11:05.540,"B-5, as in: Boy, this B thing is really starting to tick me off."
00:11:05.624,00:11:10.211,B as in battleship. B as in bourbon. B as in Belize.
00:11:10.295,00:11:13.173,"Beautiful place, so I've heard."
00:11:13.256,00:11:18.637,"I would love to go there, but let's face it, that's never gonna happen."
00:11:18.719,00:11:23.016,None of us is ever leaving this godforsaken wasteland.
00:11:27.686,00:11:29.564,Sorry.
00:11:29.648,00:11:31.525,Scratch that.
00:11:31.608,00:11:32.984,Moving on?
00:11:34.777,00:11:37.155,"I mean, what is it with this place?"
00:11:37.238,00:11:39.991,It's like living inside an Easy Bake Oven.
00:11:40.074,00:11:41.576,"I mean, look out that window."
00:11:41.660,00:11:49.250,"It's like a soulless, radioactive Georgia O'Keeffe hellscape out there, crawling with coral snakes and scorpions, and..."
00:11:49.334,00:11:51.670,You ever see the movie The Hills Have Eyes?
00:11:51.752,00:11:53.463,It's a documentary.
00:11:53.547,00:11:57.050,"God forbid, your car breaks down, you have to walk 10 steps."
00:11:57.133,00:12:02.096,You got a melanoma the size of a pineapple where your head used to be.
00:12:02.180,00:12:03.722,"So you ask, Why?"
00:12:03.806,00:12:08.687,"Why, if that's how I feel, why do I live here? Why?"
00:12:08.769,00:12:10.938,MAN: Excuse me.
00:12:11.022,00:12:12.273,Are you gonna read that number?
00:12:12.357,00:12:15.776,Yeah. I'm gonna read your number.
00:12:15.860,00:12:18.613,It's another B. Ha.
00:12:18.697,00:12:25.203,It's another freaking B. Of course. Why not? Why not?!
00:12:48.643,00:12:51.104,"Now, Chet was a real asshole."
00:12:51.187,00:12:53.273,He might have owed me some money.
00:12:53.356,00:13:00.697,He might have slept with my wife before she became my ex-wife. The details don't matter.
00:13:04.743,00:13:10.707,"All right. So one summer evening, I was out having a few drinks, one or two, maybe three. Ha."
00:13:10.789,00:13:16.003,You get the picture. And who do I see? Chet.
00:13:16.087,00:13:26.889,"He drove up and he double-parked outside a Dairy Queen and went in to get some soft serve. Now, Chet drove-- And this will give you an idea of exactly what kind of a douchebag this guy was."
00:13:26.973,00:13:32.562,Drove a white pearlescent BMW 7 Series with white leather interior.
00:13:32.646,00:13:37.984,"Heh. So I saw that thing and I had had a few, like I said."
00:13:38.067,00:13:40.695,"And, uh..."
00:13:40.779,00:13:44.823,I climbed up top and I may have...
00:13:47.034,00:13:50.037,"defecated, uh..."
00:13:50.121,00:13:51.665,through the sunroof.
00:14:00.298,00:14:04.177,"Not my finest hour, I'll grant you that."
00:14:04.260,00:14:08.264,But that's what a Chicago Sunroof is. Now you know. Heh.
00:14:08.348,00:14:12.018,It's a real thing. I didn't make it up.
00:14:12.101,00:14:15.814,I'm not the first person to do it. There's a name for it.
00:14:17.607,00:14:21.986,"Guy wanted some soft serve, I gave him some soft serve."
00:14:22.069,00:14:26.073,I did not know that his children were in the backseat.
00:14:26.157,00:14:34.749,There was a level of tint on the windows that I'll maintain to this day was not legal in an Illinois licensed vehicle.
00:14:34.833,00:14:37.918,"But somehow, that's on me, I guess."
00:14:39.671,00:14:45.468,Who leaves two Cub Scouts in a double-parked car with the engine running?
00:14:45.552,00:14:48.346,Come on.
00:14:48.429,00:14:53.518,"Now, Chet was connected, see? Like Cicero, connected."
00:14:53.601,00:15:00.024,"So usually I'd be looking at malicious mischief, public intoxication, disorderly conduct, maybe."
00:15:04.320,00:15:06.573,Calling me a sex offender. What?
00:15:06.656,00:15:11.994,"One little Chicago Sunroof, and suddenly I'm Charles Manson?!"
00:15:12.078,00:15:15.164,And that's where it all went off the rails.
00:15:23.631,00:15:25.759,I don't...
00:15:30.054,00:15:32.682,You know what?
00:15:32.766,00:15:36.143,"Any of this stuff you want, come get it."
00:15:36.227,00:15:39.898,Kitty-cat notebooks for everybody.
00:16:52.428,00:16:55.473,What can I get you? Old Style.
00:16:55.556,00:16:58.935,Make it two. You got it.
00:16:59.018,00:17:01.061,What happened to Merna? Merna?
00:17:01.145,00:17:04.148,She's doing all right. She's my stepmom.
00:17:04.231,00:17:07.443,She don't come in much anymore.
00:17:07.527,00:17:10.655,Tell her Slippin' Jimmy says hello.
00:17:10.738,00:17:13.240,Slippin' Jimmy? She'll know.
00:17:13.324,00:17:16.494,I'll tell her. That'll be 5.50.
00:17:40.434,00:17:42.353,Marco.
00:17:42.436,00:17:45.690,You gorgeous hunk of a man.
00:17:45.773,00:17:50.194,How long will you keep me waiting?
00:17:53.990,00:17:56.200,Bought you a beer.
00:17:57.785,00:17:59.078,Jimmy?
00:17:59.161,00:18:01.288,In the flesh.
00:18:01.372,00:18:02.832,Come here. Hey.
00:18:04.458,00:18:07.045,"JIMMY: So I'm not dark enough for you, huh?"
00:18:07.127,00:18:10.089,"MARCO: No, I'm just saying, I don't see any color."
00:18:10.172,00:18:16.136,"I mean, 10 years in a desert, you should look like Anthony Quinn in Lawrence of Arabia."
00:18:16.220,00:18:18.973,"Turks, they paid me in golden treasure."
00:18:19.057,00:18:23.269,"BOTH: Yet, I am poor. Because I am a river to my people."
00:18:23.352,00:18:25.563,"Hey, I'm Irish, okay?"
00:18:25.646,00:18:28.148,I spend my time staying out of the sun.
00:18:28.232,00:18:31.485,"Speaking of pale sons of bitches, how's your brother doing?"
00:18:31.569,00:18:33.821,Chuck's fine.
00:18:33.905,00:18:35.322,Still working for him?
00:18:39.285,00:18:45.374,"What about you? I mean, besides falling asleep on a bar at 4:00 on a Wednesday afternoon."
00:18:49.629,00:18:51.589,My brother-in-law owns the company.
00:18:51.672,00:18:53.173,Hold it. You got married?
00:18:56.010,00:18:59.388,"So, what the hell's a standpipe? You know what a standpipe is."
00:18:59.472,00:19:01.724,I don't think so. The fire department comes.
00:19:01.808,00:19:05.185,"Stick one end of the hose on the hydrant, the other on the standpipe."
00:19:05.269,00:19:07.772,"Water goes out the standpipe, through the sprinklers."
00:19:07.855,00:19:10.566,And then douses the flames. It's important stuff.
00:19:10.650,00:19:12.819,"So that's what a standpipe is, huh?"
00:19:12.902,00:19:14.821,"Well, it's a dry standpipe."
00:19:14.904,00:19:17.991,There's also the wet standpipe. What's the difference?
00:19:18.074,00:19:20.827,I don't know if I could explain it to a layman.
00:19:24.747,00:19:28.459,Ahem. Excuse me. How's your mom?
00:19:28.542,00:19:33.547,She passed away about three years ago.
00:19:33.631,00:19:36.759,That's too bad. A great lady.
00:19:36.843,00:19:38.594,"Yeah. From Wisconsin, right?"
00:19:38.678,00:19:40.220,Yeah.
00:19:40.304,00:19:42.056,The funeral out there?
00:19:43.349,00:19:45.518,"No, it was here."
00:19:45.601,00:19:47.353,Here?
00:19:48.896,00:19:52.566,"Yeah, well, we were only in town for a few days, so..."
00:19:55.277,00:19:57.697,"You're in town, you didn't look me up?"
00:19:57.780,00:20:00.491,Chuck was in the middle of a big case.
00:20:00.574,00:20:03.619,And we couldn't stay around. So...
00:20:07.331,00:20:09.249,BARTENDER: Can I get you guys anything else?
00:20:09.333,00:20:11.502,I'm good. Want anything? Nuh-uh.
00:20:11.585,00:20:13.337,BARTENDER: Your change here for you.
00:20:13.420,00:20:17.133,Hey. Thank you.
00:20:27.852,00:20:29.770,How's my Cutlass running?
00:20:29.854,00:20:32.190,Gets me around.
00:20:32.272,00:20:34.358,"Well, it's a classic."
00:20:42.449,00:20:44.785,"So, what you gonna do while you're here?"
00:20:44.869,00:20:47.580,"I don't know. See the sights, you know?"
00:20:47.663,00:20:50.499,Catch a Cubbies game from the bleachers.
00:20:50.583,00:20:53.211,Get a hot dog at Henry's.
00:20:54.587,00:21:00.051,MAN: Mm-hm. Yeah. Uh-huh.
00:21:00.134,00:21:01.928,All right.
00:21:03.554,00:21:06.224,I'm gonna see them tomorrow.
00:21:06.306,00:21:08.392,"Yeah, both of them."
00:21:11.062,00:21:12.605,Okay. Bye.
00:21:12.688,00:21:14.232,Is he a regular?
00:21:14.356,00:21:16.358,No.
00:21:19.737,00:21:22.281,You're buying. I'm selling.
00:21:36.545,00:21:38.589,JIMMY: All I'm asking is that you take a look.
00:21:38.672,00:21:42.301,"I'm sorry, buddy. No offense. I'm just-- You know, I'm not interested."
00:21:42.384,00:21:43.594,"Come on, man."
00:21:43.677,00:21:45.096,What's it gonna hurt to take a look?
00:21:45.179,00:21:46.889,It'll take you two seconds.
00:21:49.267,00:21:53.353,All right. All right. Show me what you got.
00:21:57.399,00:22:00.611,Okay.
00:22:00.694,00:22:02.321,You see it?
00:22:02.404,00:22:04.949,I see a Kennedy half-dollar.
00:22:09.996,00:22:12.915,Exactly.
00:22:12.999,00:22:16.502,Which way is he supposed to be facing?
00:22:16.585,00:22:19.588,Right. He's supposed to be facing right.
00:22:19.672,00:22:23.217,Okay. So why is this one facing left?
00:22:23.301,00:22:27.805,"Heh. November 22nd, 1963."
00:22:27.888,00:22:30.141,"Kennedy is assassinated, right?"
00:22:30.224,00:22:32.310,The whole nation goes into mourning.
00:22:32.392,00:22:34.937,They start naming everything in sight after him.
00:22:35.021,00:22:36.897,The mint wants in on the act.
00:22:36.981,00:22:41.861,"So in '64, they decide to change the Lincoln half-dollar into the Kennedy half-dollar."
00:22:41.944,00:22:45.739,"When they design it, they put Kennedy facing right, facing east."
00:22:45.823,00:22:48.701,Just the way they had Lincoln. You know why?
00:22:48.784,00:22:50.536,East symbolizes the dawn.
00:22:50.619,00:22:53.331,That's why pretty much every grave everywhere faces east.
00:22:53.413,00:22:56.292,So the spirit of the dead person faces the rising sun.
00:22:56.374,00:22:58.460,So that thing. It's a burial thing.
00:22:58.544,00:23:01.047,"But there's one technician in the Denver mint, right?"
00:23:01.130,00:23:05.926,"This guy, he believed in the New Frontier, Camelot, the whole deal."
00:23:06.010,00:23:08.512,"So the assassination, it just destroyed him."
00:23:08.595,00:23:14.143,"When he sees that coin with Kennedy facing east, facing the American past, it pissed him off."
00:23:14.227,00:23:16.062,And so he went rogue.
00:23:16.145,00:23:23.236,"Without telling anybody, he flipped things around so that Kennedy was facing west towards the New Frontier, the future."
00:23:23.319,00:23:28.115,"Now, the mint struck about 3000 of these before they figured it out. They canned the guy."
00:23:28.199,00:23:31.285,About 1000 of them made it out into general circulation.
00:23:31.369,00:23:33.662,"They managed to get most of them back, melt them down."
00:23:33.746,00:23:39.377,But there's still 200 plus floating around out there.
00:23:41.128,00:23:43.421,What's that? I didn't catch that.
00:23:43.505,00:23:45.423,I didn't say anything.
00:23:45.507,00:23:48.635,"You mind, buddy? We're having a private conversation here."
00:23:50.846,00:23:53.182,This one's not in perfect condition.
00:23:53.266,00:23:59.437,"But on the open market, I'd say it's worth 6 or 800 bucks."
00:24:07.280,00:24:11.200,You want me to give you $100 for a half-dollar?
00:24:11.284,00:24:15.621,I want you to give me $100 for an $800 coin.
00:24:15.704,00:24:18.540,"Yeah, I don't know, man."
00:24:19.625,00:24:22.753,I'm gonna go drain the snake. Think about it.
00:24:30.677,00:24:32.388,"This guy's playing me, right?"
00:24:32.470,00:24:35.682,Definitely. Slick son of a bitch.
00:24:35.766,00:24:37.475,"You know, I should..."
00:24:42.106,00:24:45.151,"You know, I know this guy on Wabash."
00:24:45.234,00:24:47.278,"Coin dealer, a friend of my uncle's."
00:24:47.361,00:24:50.239,"Hey, Joey, can I use your phone? Local call."
00:24:50.323,00:24:51.865,Keep it short.
00:24:53.075,00:24:56.287,Let's see... Bam.
00:24:56.370,00:24:58.038,I'm gonna call this guy.
00:24:58.122,00:25:00.791,"When he tells me this is a scam, know what I'm gonna do?"
00:25:00.874,00:25:02.251,I'm gonna call the cops.
00:25:02.335,00:25:04.586,And get this scumbag thrown in the can.
00:25:04.670,00:25:05.838,"You're my witness, okay?"
00:25:08.215,00:25:10.217,Facing west.
00:25:10.301,00:25:12.886,My hairy ass.
00:25:15.473,00:25:19.601,"How you doing? Yeah, it's Alvin, Dave Tanner's nephew."
00:25:19.685,00:25:22.313,Yeah. Mm-hm.
00:25:22.396,00:25:24.273,Yeah. That's right.
00:25:24.357,00:25:27.109,"Hey, this is gonna sound like the beginning of a bad joke."
00:25:27.193,00:25:33.407,"But I'm in this bar, and I got this guy spinning this cock-and-bull story about this 50-cent piece he's trying to sell me."
00:25:33.491,00:25:39.955,He says... He says Kennedy's supposed to be facing west or something.
00:25:41.290,00:25:43.167,Yeah?
00:25:45.378,00:25:48.422,Yeah. Ahem.
00:25:50.090,00:25:52.592,Mm-hm.
00:25:56.305,00:25:58.807,Yeah. That's what he said. Denver.
00:25:58.891,00:26:01.768,"Jesus, no kidding?"
00:26:01.852,00:26:03.729,Look. Listen. I gotta go. All right.
00:26:03.812,00:26:07.233,"Thank you. Yeah, I owe you one."
00:26:08.608,00:26:10.610,"Thanks, Joey."
00:26:10.694,00:26:12.196,So what'd he say?
00:26:12.279,00:26:14.614,"Yeah, he didn't really know much."
00:26:19.036,00:26:21.414,I'll tell you what. I'll give you $50 for it.
00:26:28.628,00:26:30.464,"It's an $800 coin, okay?"
00:26:30.548,00:26:32.632,I'm not gonna sell it to you for $64.
00:26:32.716,00:26:34.592,"If you wait for me, I'll get you 100 bucks."
00:26:34.676,00:26:35.844,I don't know.
00:26:37.346,00:26:40.182,"Hey, buddy. I got 75 bucks right here."
00:26:40.266,00:26:42.600,"Hey, I-- Sorry. I need a hundred."
00:26:42.684,00:26:44.353,"Hey, slick, nobody's talking to you."
00:26:44.437,00:26:46.646,"Mind your own business, okay? Come on."
00:26:46.730,00:26:48.899,"Cash money, $80."
00:26:48.982,00:26:52.778,"Look, if you give me a chance, I'll be back with $100-- How long will that be?"
00:26:54.821,00:26:56.907,This guy was getting ready to call the cops.
00:26:56.990,00:26:58.492,"No, I was not. Why would you?"
00:26:58.576,00:27:01.203,"This guy is making shit up. Hey, I got 110 here."
00:27:01.287,00:27:02.662,"Sold. No, no, no."
00:27:02.746,00:27:04.706,This guy's got the cash. Don't do that.
00:27:04.790,00:27:06.417,Take care of that. It's history there.
00:27:06.500,00:27:08.001,"Hey, you can't do that."
00:27:08.085,00:27:10.003,Money talks. You lost. It's over.
00:27:10.087,00:27:11.422,"No, it's not over."
00:27:11.505,00:27:13.382,That's crap. Where do you think you're going?
00:27:13.466,00:27:14.883,"Back off, dude."
00:27:14.967,00:27:17.803,I'll back off when you give me the JFK back.
00:27:17.886,00:27:20.264,Call the cops. This guy just tried to rip me off.
00:27:20.347,00:27:22.266,This guy's a liar. I did not rip anybody off.
00:27:22.349,00:27:25.394,"Yes, you did. You come back in here, your ass is grass."
00:27:26.937,00:27:29.731,You hear me? You double-dealing bastard.
00:27:29.815,00:27:32.485,I got friends!
00:27:36.863,00:27:40.618,You are so beautiful. Mwah! Ha!
00:27:40.700,00:27:44.246,"Hey, everybody. Next round's on us."
00:27:52.254,00:27:54.965,All right. You listening?
00:27:55.048,00:27:56.716,Can you keep a secret?
00:27:56.800,00:27:59.261,Yeah. Absolutely.
00:27:59.345,00:28:02.848,"Okay, his name is Idi Abbassi."
00:28:02.931,00:28:06.352,He's 27 years old. He's a Nigerian prince.
00:28:06.435,00:28:10.606,"He's worth, conservatively, $400 million."
00:28:10.688,00:28:15.653,The dictatorship of Equatorial Uqbar Orbis is detaining him on trumped-up charges.
00:28:20.698,00:28:26.872,"The hitch is the banks have frozen their-- --assets. I'm talking Irish Sweeps tickets, a whole trunk full of them."
00:28:26.955,00:28:30.250,"They're just sitting at O'Hare, impounded in customs."
00:28:30.334,00:28:32.336,"Now, I know what you're saying, So what?"
00:28:32.419,00:28:34.087,I can leave this as security.
00:28:34.171,00:28:36.549,"But you got to understand, this violin is my livelihood."
00:28:36.632,00:28:38.050,It's a valuable antique.
00:28:38.133,00:28:39.801,What do you mean it doesn't belong to you?
00:28:39.885,00:28:42.262,I'll pay 900 bucks for this. Cash on the barrel.
00:28:42.346,00:28:44.390,MARCO: I don't know. I hate to part with it.
00:28:44.473,00:28:46.975,Been in my family for years. JIMMY: You can keep a secret?
00:28:47.059,00:28:49.311,MAN: Yeah. Absolutely. JIMMY: You need a good front.
00:28:49.395,00:28:51.730,So you're gonna have the most return on your dollars.
00:28:51.813,00:28:53.440,But I know this customs officer.
00:28:53.524,00:28:55.775,Make it an investment. If the price is right.
00:28:55.859,00:28:58.571,"JIMMY: I'm all about investments, all about what's coming next."
00:28:58.654,00:29:01.740,"Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car out of this bad neighborhood."
00:29:01.823,00:29:03.450,"Sir, sir, could you help me?"
00:29:03.534,00:29:05.160,"Tell me, are these today's numbers?"
00:29:05.244,00:29:07.580,"Now, none of this was strictly legal, right?"
00:29:07.663,00:29:09.831,And the import taxes would have been a killer.
00:29:09.915,00:29:13.877,He had to find a way to get money into the country without anyone knowing.
00:29:13.960,00:29:17.297,"MARCO: He coated the cash with this black stuff, vectrol paste."
00:29:17.381,00:29:20.967,JIMMY: And the only way to get it off is with this special chemical.
00:29:21.051,00:29:22.761,"MARCO: It's not cheap, but the upside?"
00:29:22.844,00:29:24.555,JIMMY: The upside is huge.
00:29:24.638,00:29:26.390,Can you keep a secret?
00:29:26.473,00:29:28.517,"You know, the guy in Dances With Wolves?"
00:29:30.977,00:29:32.896,"A guy like you, who's got some money."
00:29:32.979,00:29:35.566,"Got some money to throw around. I know, Who cares?"
00:29:35.649,00:29:38.026,"No matter which one wins, we're gonna get a piece."
00:29:38.110,00:29:40.820,He's got a gambling problem. Nobody can come after you.
00:29:40.904,00:29:42.698,You get the profit. The price is right.
00:29:42.781,00:29:44.116,It's a win-win for you.
00:29:44.199,00:29:45.743,It's a lose-lose for everybody else.
00:29:45.825,00:29:47.953,You tell the guy you've got a 14.
00:29:48.036,00:29:50.581,"He checks, realizes... Why we're getting a consortium."
00:29:50.664,00:29:53.250,It's just gonna be a piece of the pie.
00:29:53.333,00:29:56.462,"But you're gonna own a full mountain range, guaranteed."
00:29:58.338,00:29:59.839,Can you keep-- A secret?
00:29:59.923,00:30:03.885,Because I really-- Really shouldn't-- Be telling you this.
00:30:21.111,00:30:22.821,Hey.
00:30:22.904,00:30:24.990,JIMMY: Hey.
00:30:25.073,00:30:28.452,You are not Kevin Costner.
00:30:31.079,00:30:33.499,Jesus.
00:30:35.000,00:30:37.461,Asshole.
00:30:37.544,00:30:40.714,"I mean, seriously?"
00:30:40.798,00:30:43.883,"Oh, Lucianne? Lucianne. LUCIANNE: What?"
00:30:43.967,00:30:45.927,WOMAN: He's not Kevin Costner.
00:30:46.011,00:30:47.429,LUCIANNE: What? So who's this guy?
00:30:47.513,00:30:50.307,WOMAN: Not Kevin Costner's manager.
00:30:50.390,00:30:52.476,"Come on. Let's go. LUCIANNE: Okay, okay."
00:30:52.559,00:30:53.727,WOMAN: Come on.
00:30:53.811,00:30:56.896,Get the hell out of this dump.
00:30:59.899,00:31:02.110,"WOMAN: Yes, Luci, I am sure."
00:31:02.194,00:31:04.070,He said he was gonna give me his card.
00:31:04.154,00:31:06.198,WOMAN: Does this look like a manager's place?
00:31:06.281,00:31:09.493,Can I interest you ladies in some mimosas?
00:31:12.496,00:31:15.541,"Screw you. If you build it, I will come."
00:31:15.624,00:31:18.836,"Luci, come on. Okay."
00:31:18.918,00:31:20.337,Bye.
00:31:20.420,00:31:23.590,WOMAN: Come on. That door sticks.
00:31:23.674,00:31:25.342,"Yeah, okay. I got it. Okay."
00:31:26.343,00:31:29.346,Go. Go. Okay.
00:32:26.236,00:32:29.239,AUTOMATED VOICE: You have 15 messages.

00:32:56.057,00:32:58.727,"Marco, I'm sorry. I gotta go back."
00:32:58.811,00:33:01.187,What?
00:33:01.271,00:33:05.233,It's been great. And I appreciate your hospitality.
00:33:05.317,00:33:10.405,But a week's gonna have to do it. I gotta go home.
00:33:10.489,00:33:13.074,I already called in sick.
00:33:15.744,00:33:18.413,"Come on, man. This is home. You hate it out there."
00:33:21.166,00:33:22.751,My clients.
00:33:22.835,00:33:24.837,What clients?
00:33:24.920,00:33:28.841,"What are you, like a gigolo or something? Heh."
00:33:29.883,00:33:32.803,"Uh, Marco. Ahem."
00:33:34.179,00:33:36.556,I'm a lawyer.
00:33:36.640,00:33:38.350,What?
00:33:38.433,00:33:42.896,"Honest to God. I do elder law, which is like wills and estates."
00:33:42.980,00:33:44.397,So you're ripping off old people?
00:33:44.481,00:33:46.817,"No, I'm not ripping off old people."
00:33:46.900,00:33:49.611,I'm not ripping off anybody.
00:33:49.695,00:33:52.405,Holy crap. Slippin' Jimmy's a lawyer?
00:33:53.782,00:33:55.534,No wonder you wanna go back.
00:33:55.617,00:33:58.244,"I mean, you got to be king of the desert."
00:33:58.328,00:34:00.873,"Driving around town in a white Caddy, making bank."
00:34:00.956,00:34:04.125,"I'm not making bank. I'm making a living, more or less."
00:34:04.209,00:34:10.173,"A living? All due respect, you're a lawyer and you're not making bank, you're doing it wrong."
00:34:10.256,00:34:12.509,I'm building something. Takes time.
00:34:12.592,00:34:14.469,"You're gonna build something, build it here."
00:34:14.553,00:34:16.638,Lawyers in Chicago make plenty.
00:34:16.722,00:34:19.766,"I don't know what to tell you, Marco."
00:34:19.850,00:34:24.521,"Chuck's in Albuquerque. Again, all due respect, Chuck's a stuck-up douchebag."
00:34:24.604,00:34:27.900,"I hate to break it to you, but he doesn't even like you."
00:34:30.402,00:34:33.071,He's my brother.
00:34:35.365,00:34:38.869,Okay. I get it.
00:34:38.952,00:34:41.705,Family. You gotta go back.
00:34:41.788,00:34:43.331,But...
00:34:50.589,00:34:52.716,Remember this?
00:34:52.799,00:34:56.720,The Rolex thing. Whatever happened to the guy who used to sell us those?
00:34:56.803,00:35:01.892,Jin Kang? He got deported. This is the last one.
00:35:01.975,00:35:03.351,I say we go for it.
00:35:03.435,00:35:04.644,No.
00:35:04.728,00:35:06.479,"Come on. Last time, we did what, 600?"
00:35:06.563,00:35:09.232,"The hot streak we're on, I bet we'd break a grand."
00:35:09.315,00:35:13.111,"I could lend you some cash. I don't need the money, Jimmy."
00:35:14.947,00:35:17.908,Come on. You say you're happy doing wills or whatever.
00:35:17.991,00:35:19.785,"Good for you, man. Seriously."
00:35:19.868,00:35:24.497,"But I gotta tell you, standpipes ain't cutting it for me, man."
00:35:24.581,00:35:27.667,"I got nothing, Jimmy."
00:35:31.838,00:35:33.423,"Give me this, man."
00:35:33.506,00:35:36.051,I can't do it. Come on. Give me this.
00:35:36.134,00:35:37.719,Marco. Give me this. Come on.
00:35:37.803,00:35:39.471,Listen to me. I'm listening.
00:35:39.554,00:35:41.514,Hey. One last time. Come on.
00:35:41.598,00:35:43.182,I'm not being hypnotized.
00:35:43.266,00:35:45.811,Okay. Come on. One more time. I can't do it.
00:35:45.894,00:35:48.772,"Just one more. One more. Hey, listen to me."
00:35:48.855,00:35:50.273,I'm listening. Come on.
00:36:56.339,00:36:58.508,JIMMY: Yeah.
00:36:59.926,00:37:01.803,It's gotta come from the gut. KEVIN: Yeah.
00:37:04.639,00:37:07.059,"KEVIN: Oh, that's crazy."
00:37:07.142,00:37:08.768,JIMMY: Just like a wolf. Go ahead.
00:37:16.151,00:37:18.153,Yeah. And it will escalate it...
00:37:19.863,00:37:22.574,ten times. There's something-- Hey.
00:37:22.657,00:37:24.951,It's prehistoric. Hey. Hey. Look.
00:37:38.090,00:37:40.508,Whose is it? I don't know.
00:37:40.592,00:37:45.346,There's gotta be 1000 bucks in here. Somebody must have...
00:37:45.430,00:37:47.640,Oh.
00:37:47.724,00:37:50.018,"Oh, damn."
00:38:00.528,00:38:03.115,"JIMMY: Is he, uh...? KEVIN: I don't know."
00:38:35.396,00:38:39.943,"Hey, buddy, you with us?"
00:38:40.026,00:38:45.782,"Look, the guy's just had too many. I say we move on."
00:38:45.865,00:38:47.700,You wanna split this?
00:38:47.784,00:38:49.786,"Marco, you okay?"
00:38:49.869,00:38:52.122,Marco?
00:38:52.205,00:38:56.001,"What, do you know this guy? Hey, call 911."
00:38:56.084,00:38:58.753,Call 911.
00:39:01.131,00:39:03.216,Hey.
00:39:08.805,00:39:12.100,I need an ambulance. My friend's having a heart attack.
00:39:12.184,00:39:15.478,We're in an alley southeast of LaSalle and Shermer.
00:39:15.561,00:39:19.107,"No, I don't know. He was like this when I found him."
00:39:19.191,00:39:23.153,"Hey, hold. Marco? Marco you with me? You with me?"
00:39:23.236,00:39:25.905,"I screwed up. No, you did good, buddy."
00:39:25.989,00:39:28.407,"Just hold on, all right? They're on their way."
00:39:28.491,00:39:30.910,"They'll be here in a minute. Jimmy, you know what?"
00:39:30.994,00:39:33.371,Save your breath. You're gonna be fine.
00:39:33.454,00:39:37.083,This was the greatest week of my life.
00:39:45.508,00:39:48.803,"Hey, hey, hey. Hang in there. Hey."
00:39:48.887,00:39:52.515,"Hey, hey. Hey, wake up, man."
00:39:52.598,00:39:55.601,"Come on. Marco, buddy."
00:39:57.729,00:39:59.731,Help!
00:40:01.566,00:40:03.360,Anybody.
00:40:06.321,00:40:07.488,Marco.
00:40:17.957,00:40:20.418,"Hey, Jimmy. Oh, hey, Bud."
00:40:20.501,00:40:22.795,Can I bum one?
00:40:33.431,00:40:34.849,Is that his?
00:40:34.933,00:40:37.102,Yeah.
00:40:37.185,00:40:40.479,His mom gave it to me. I thought it looked familiar.
00:40:40.563,00:40:42.815,I figured I'd wear it today.
00:40:42.899,00:40:45.944,"But I don't know. I'm not a big ring guy, so..."
00:40:48.238,00:40:51.283,Still. Could be worth couple of bucks.
00:41:05.046,00:41:07.048,Better head back.
00:41:07.132,00:41:09.467,See you inside.
00:41:32.240,00:41:35.243,Hey. KIM: Is this Ferris Bueller?
00:41:35.327,00:41:36.911,Speaking. Heh.
00:41:36.995,00:41:38.746,I don't want to interrupt your big day off.
00:41:38.830,00:41:40.915,Just checking in. What are you up to?
00:41:40.999,00:41:43.668,"You know, burning down the place."
00:41:43.751,00:41:45.378,I wouldn't expect any less.
00:41:45.462,00:41:51.134,"So whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?"
00:41:51.217,00:41:53.970,"Yep, all gone. Good."
00:41:54.053,00:41:55.763,I want to run something by you.
00:41:55.847,00:41:58.975,"The Sandpiper case, it's getting too big for HHM."
00:41:59.058,00:42:01.269,Howard's decided to partner with another firm.
00:42:01.353,00:42:03.313,"Davis and Main, you heard of them?"
00:42:03.396,00:42:04.814,"Sure, up in Santa Fe."
00:42:04.897,00:42:08.151,"Right. Well, they've heard of you too."
00:42:08.234,00:42:10.028,And they're interested.
00:42:10.111,00:42:12.322,They want to make an offer contingent on an interview.
00:42:12.405,00:42:14.324,They've got a partner-track position.
00:42:14.407,00:42:17.535,Wait. What? Partner track? What are you talking about?
00:42:17.618,00:42:20.455,There's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.
00:42:20.538,00:42:24.667,Or there could be. And you'd be working on your case.
00:42:26.961,00:42:30.631,"Well, I-- I don't even, uh..."
00:42:32.800,00:42:35.970,Chuck wouldn't like it. Chuck has no say in this.
00:42:36.054,00:42:37.596,You wouldn't be working for HHM.
00:42:37.680,00:42:40.392,And Chuck can't tell Davis and Main who to hire.
00:42:40.475,00:42:43.520,Why me? Is this like a tax write-off or a charity thing?
00:42:43.602,00:42:44.896,"What's the angle, huh?"
00:42:48.983,00:42:51.110,And they ask about you every chance they get.
00:42:51.194,00:42:54.030,"I don't know what it is, but you have a way with them."
00:42:56.908,00:43:00.953,So... sounds good?
00:43:04.207,00:43:07.126,"Kim, I can't imagine what you did to make this happen."
00:43:07.210,00:43:08.669,Thank you.
00:43:08.753,00:43:11.214,I didn't do anything much.
00:43:11.297,00:43:14.967,"And believe it or not, Howard's been pushing this too."
00:43:15.051,00:43:16.719,Good old Howard.
00:43:16.802,00:43:20.723,"Listen, we're gonna be down in Judge Murray's court on Thursday at 11."
00:43:20.806,00:43:22.725,The Davis and Main people will be there.
00:43:22.808,00:43:24.810,It'd be the perfect chance for you to meet them.
00:43:24.894,00:43:28.606,"Thursday at 11. All right. I'll be there. Thanks, Kim. Really."
00:43:28.689,00:43:30.483,I'll see you then.
00:43:41.702,00:43:44.539,CHUCK: All the originals need to be copied and filed.
00:43:44.622,00:43:47.417,"See, I've written right here on the box, copy and file."
00:43:47.500,00:43:49.085,That's to make it as clear as possible.
00:43:49.168,00:43:51.087,"Got it, Mr. McGill. Anything else?"
00:43:51.170,00:43:54.299,"Well, on the grocery front, almost everything was right this time."
00:43:54.382,00:43:56.259,Great. Almost.
00:43:56.342,00:44:00.930,"It's a small thing, but to my taste, the Granny Smith apples are a bit too tart."
00:44:01.013,00:44:04.016,"Those are the green ones, right? Right. I prefer the red ones."
00:44:04.100,00:44:07.562,But not Red Delicious. Those are generally tasteless.
00:44:07.645,00:44:12.191,"Fujis should be in season. It's not a major issue, but..."
00:44:12.275,00:44:14.319,Fuji apples. Okay.
00:44:14.402,00:44:16.070,"Oh, and I'd like to try soy milk."
00:44:16.154,00:44:17.572,So maybe a half gallon of that.
00:44:17.655,00:44:19.449,You got it.
00:44:19.532,00:44:21.075,"Well, thank you, Ernesto."
00:44:21.159,00:44:24.036,I appreciate your attention to detail.
00:44:25.413,00:44:28.625,Do you need to write any of this down?
00:44:28.707,00:44:30.460,Because it's okay if you do.
00:44:30.543,00:44:34.172,"You know, just to be sure."
00:44:34.255,00:44:36.424,So Fuji apples.
00:44:54.942,00:44:57.736,"Hey, Ernie. Hey, how you doing, man?"
00:44:57.820,00:45:01.324,"Good. Good. So Howard's got you looking after Chuck, huh?"
00:45:01.407,00:45:03.409,"Yeah. It's a few extra bucks, you know?"
00:45:03.493,00:45:04.701,How's he doing?
00:45:04.785,00:45:06.954,"Seems okay, like usual."
00:45:07.038,00:45:11.334,"I'd say we could grab a beer, but they're waiting on paperwork at the office."
00:45:11.417,00:45:13.961,You know how it is. Don't I though? Heh.
00:45:14.045,00:45:15.754,"See you, Jimmy."
00:45:15.838,00:45:18.049,"See you around, Ernie."
00:45:56.504,00:45:59.173,You done business with him before?
00:46:00.508,00:46:02.301,Right.
00:46:02.385,00:46:05.971,Yeah. I'll be there.
00:46:33.291,00:46:37.836,Davis and Main and McGill. Heh.
00:46:37.920,00:46:42.634,"Great to meet you. Ahem. Nice to meet you, gentlemen."
00:46:42.717,00:46:44.302,It's good to meet you.
00:46:44.385,00:46:46.262,Nice.
00:47:12.789,00:47:14.290,"MIKE: Well, that was quick."
00:47:14.373,00:47:17.126,No charge. Help me out here.
00:47:17.209,00:47:23.341,"Did I dream it or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?"
00:47:23.424,00:47:26.177,"When I close my eyes, I can still see it."
00:47:26.260,00:47:29.430,It's burned into my retinas like I was staring into the sun.
00:47:29.514,00:47:32.183,No one on God's green Earth knew we had it.
00:47:32.266,00:47:33.934,We could have split it 50-50.
00:47:34.018,00:47:40.107,"We could have gone home with $800,000 each, tax free."
00:47:40.191,00:47:42.234,Your point being?
00:47:42.318,00:47:44.903,Why didn't we? What stopped us?
00:47:44.987,00:47:49.908,I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.
00:47:49.992,00:47:52.537,I don't even know what that means.
00:47:52.620,00:47:54.789,You want to know why I didn't take that money?
00:47:54.871,00:47:56.957,Is that what you're asking?
00:47:57.041,00:47:58.751,"Yeah, that's what I'm asking."
00:47:58.835,00:48:03.172,"Me, personally, I was hired to do a job. I did it."
00:48:03.255,00:48:05.174,That's as far as it goes.
00:48:05.257,00:48:09.387,"Yeah. Well, I know what stopped me."
00:48:09.470,00:48:11.055,And you know what?
00:48:11.138,00:48:13.850,It's never stopping me again.
