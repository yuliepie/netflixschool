00:01:05.440,00:01:07.275,Hope you got your beauty sleep.
00:01:10.278,00:01:12.697,"Please, let me go on a crusade!"
00:01:12.781,00:01:15.200,Anything's safer than guarding that princess.
00:01:22.040,00:01:23.541,All in.
00:01:29.631,00:01:31.174,Two pair.
00:01:31.257,00:01:32.425,Not so fast.
00:01:33.093,00:01:34.803,Three me's.
00:01:34.886,00:01:36.554,That's only two.
00:01:36.638,00:01:39.432,"One, two, me."
00:01:40.016,00:01:40.892,Money's mine.
00:01:42.811,00:01:44.562,Not when I got the knife.
00:02:41.244,00:02:42.745,See you guys tomorrow.
00:02:44.539,00:02:47.792,You've had your fun. Now it's time to get married.
00:02:48.585,00:02:51.212,Would Your Highness care to get in?
00:02:54.924,00:02:56.801,"-Morning, Princess! -Lovely day, miss!"
00:02:56.885,00:02:58.052,"How's it hanging, Princess?"
00:02:58.136,00:03:01.389,-Sorry I can't make your wedding. -You wanna switch places?
00:03:01.472,00:03:02.515,"No, I'm good."
00:03:03.892,00:03:06.144,"-Enjoy your special day. -You, too."
00:03:07.145,00:03:10.064,"Morning, Princess. Care to try my new cure-all?"
00:03:10.148,00:03:11.733,It wards off deadly plague.
00:03:11.816,00:03:14.986,"I'm actually hoping for death. Thanks, though."
00:03:17.655,00:03:19.657,"Gah! Quit judging me, Dad."
00:03:39.677,00:03:43.681,"This one needs royaling up. More columns, more frosting."
00:03:43.765,00:03:46.184,And neither of these looks like me.
00:03:46.267,00:03:49.437,"Make them both look like me. Then, get rid of one!"
00:03:58.529,00:03:59.864,Ugh. Cakes.
00:04:00.531,00:04:02.659,Did you make sure to add extra frosting?
00:04:02.742,00:04:05.787,"Of course, I... Hey! Where were you?"
00:04:05.870,00:04:07.330,"Oh, I understand, darling."
00:04:07.413,00:04:10.625,"On my wedding day, I also had butterflies in stomach."
00:04:10.708,00:04:12.627,I shouldn't have eaten so many.
00:04:13.211,00:04:17.882,I just wanted to have a last bit of fun before the happiest day of my life.
00:04:17.966,00:04:22.262,Silence! The delegation from Bentwood arrives any moment.
00:04:22.345,00:04:26.015,Take off those common clothes and come down looking like a princess!
00:04:26.099,00:04:27.600,"As you wish, Father."
00:04:31.521,00:04:35.275,"Anybody looks at her, they get their head chopped off."
00:04:38.027,00:04:40.822,"Oh, boy, did I look at her!"
00:04:43.283,00:04:44.200,What?
00:04:55.586,00:04:59.299,Great. I have to wear this crazy veil and pretend I'm a virgin?
00:04:59.382,00:05:02.760,"It's not a veil, ma'am. It's your corset."
00:05:02.844,00:05:06.639,See? It pushes all the mincemeat to the top of the pie.
00:05:06.723,00:05:10.018,All this wedding hassle for a stupid political alliance?
00:05:10.101,00:05:13.313,"I thought that I'd get married for true love, or because I was wasted."
00:05:13.396,00:05:15.690,"Lots of reasons to get married, ma'am."
00:05:15.773,00:05:17.692,I got married for a goat.
00:05:17.775,00:05:23.740,"Now, let's hurry. The prince will be here any minute to marry you and, time permitting, meet you."
00:05:26.326,00:05:27.493,Eh? Huh?
00:05:27.577,00:05:29.620,"How do I look? Spiffy, right?"
00:05:29.704,00:05:32.248,I had the dogs lick me clean twice.
00:05:46.054,00:05:52.560,"Announcing the King and Queen of Bentwood, Lorenzo the First and Bunny."
00:05:54.103,00:05:56.439,"Welcome, Your Highnesses."
00:05:58.983,00:06:02.487,Or should I just call you brother and sister?
00:06:02.570,00:06:05.031,We are brother and sister. What of it?
00:06:05.114,00:06:15.249,"And their son-slash-nephew, hero of the Battle Against That Bird That Flew Into The Room One Time, groom-to-be, Prince Guysbert of Bentwood."
00:06:17.210,00:06:19.087,Va-va-voom!
00:06:20.046,00:06:22.048,You never do that for me.
00:06:28.388,00:06:32.350,"No, I just feel like my life is ending. I can't even smile."
00:06:33.768,00:06:37.355,Don't worry. We'll make your cheeks look nice and rosy.
00:06:37.438,00:06:40.983,Remember: Whores rouge. Ladies leech.
00:06:41.692,00:06:46.322,"You ever wish you could live in a place where people are really, truly happy?"
00:07:31.242,00:07:35.037,"Kissy, save your lips for the prepackaged candy assortments."
00:07:35.121,00:07:39.333,"And, Elfo, it's like you don't appreciate your assembly-line job."
00:07:39.417,00:07:42.128,"Yeah, uh, it's kinda not the one I wanted."
00:07:42.211,00:07:45.882,I'm kinda not always... happy?
00:07:47.175,00:07:48.676,But we're singing.
00:07:48.759,00:07:53.347,"Yeah, singing while you work's not happiness. It's mental illness."
00:07:53.431,00:07:54.682,Wha...
00:07:54.765,00:07:57.935,Ugh! I'm sick of being happy all the time.
00:07:58.019,00:07:59.729,"Just once, I wish..."
00:07:59.812,00:08:03.649,I wish I could go somewhere where people are miserable.
00:08:14.577,00:08:15.411,Hmm.
00:08:18.289,00:08:19.832,What is going on with this gift?
00:08:28.174,00:08:34.347,"Princess Tiabeanie, you are hereby cursed from the deepest depths of the underworld!"
00:08:34.430,00:08:35.431,Oh! What?
00:08:35.973,00:08:38.851,"You look great, though. Nice to meet you. They call me Luci."
00:08:40.645,00:08:42.104,-Guards! Guards! -Shh! Shh!
00:08:42.188,00:08:44.982,A weird ghost guy is attacking and complimenting me.
00:08:45.066,00:08:46.567,Shut up! Silenzio!
00:08:48.736,00:08:50.154,"First up, not a ghost."
00:08:50.238,00:08:51.822,Ghosts are losers that got murdered.
00:08:54.951,00:08:57.662,"That's right. In fact, your personal demon."
00:08:57.745,00:09:01.666,"Get used to it, 'cause you are stuck with me for all eter..."
00:09:08.297,00:09:09.507,...nity.
00:09:14.303,00:09:17.139,And so the demonic binding begins.
00:09:17.223,00:09:20.768,"Yes, our emissary will steer her towards the darkness."
00:09:20.851,00:09:22.853,"It may take months, even years."
00:09:22.937,00:09:24.522,"So, we'll need chairs."
00:09:24.605,00:09:26.315,Dark chairs.
00:09:37.368,00:09:41.038,Just because I'm not jolly all the time doesn't make me a weirdo.
00:09:41.122,00:09:43.457,"Hey! Get outta here, Weirdo!"
00:09:53.301,00:09:56.762,-Your whining really turns me on. -There's more where that came from.
00:09:56.846,00:09:59.849,We spend all day making candy to earn candy.
00:09:59.932,00:10:01.559,It doesn't make any sense!
00:10:01.642,00:10:04.562,You're so sad. You're a sad little elf!
00:10:04.645,00:10:07.481,Kissy! What in humping heavens is going on?
00:10:07.565,00:10:08.899,"Nothing, Father!"
00:10:08.983,00:10:11.944,Weirdo doesn't take his pants off for nothing. Elfo?
00:10:12.028,00:10:13.112,Oh! Ow.
00:10:13.195,00:10:16.115,This is the last straw. You're going to be punished.
00:10:16.198,00:10:19.035,What are you gonna do? Give me a paddling with a big wollypop?
00:10:19.118,00:10:22.788,This is serious. You'll be hanged from the Gumdrop Tree.
00:10:27.960,00:10:32.214,"Oh, this is all me fault, my boy. I got something to tell ya."
00:10:32.298,00:10:33.633,Oh! Pops!
00:10:33.716,00:10:37.136,"Well, it's gonna take a while, so let me pull up this chair."
00:10:37.219,00:10:38.095,Hey.
00:10:40.139,00:10:43.267,"Oh, yeah, it all started when I first laid eyes on your mother."
00:10:43.351,00:10:44.310,"I mean, hands."
00:10:44.393,00:10:49.190,"I couldn't keep them to myself, and all of a sudden, she gave me a right hook, -and I was in love. -Pops!"
00:10:53.402,00:10:54.236,Whoa!
00:10:55.946,00:10:56.781,Olé!
00:10:59.075,00:11:00.451,I'm already cursed enough.
00:11:00.534,00:11:03.204,I don't need some demon making my life worse.
00:11:03.829,00:11:04.664,Oh!
00:11:04.747,00:11:06.207,That's no ladies' mace.
00:11:09.543,00:11:17.343,"Yeah, look, you're stuck with me forever, so just take a deep breath and-- Ow! Ow! Ow!"
00:11:20.012,00:11:23.933,"And that, my friend, is how one returns a gift."
00:11:24.016,00:11:27.395,"If you don't calm down, this is gonna be a long forever."
00:11:28.646,00:11:30.231,"Okay, you win."
00:11:36.195,00:11:38.656,I told you elves are too light to hang.
00:11:38.739,00:11:40.991,The last guy we hanged died of old age.
00:11:41.075,00:11:42.535,Fine. Stab him!
00:11:43.828,00:11:44.995,"Father, stop!"
00:11:45.079,00:11:47.498,You can't just kill every guy that kisses me.
00:11:47.581,00:11:48.874,Sure I can.
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.010,"Run, Elfo! Run far away!"
00:12:00.094,00:12:01.053,Come with me!
00:12:37.256,00:12:41.051,"Kissy, you've come this far. Don't you want to see the outside world?"
00:12:41.135,00:12:44.889,"Elfo, I've never said this before, but I can't go all the way."
00:12:47.433,00:12:49.810,"Elfo, no! It is forbidden."
00:12:49.894,00:12:52.021,I don't know why we keep that lever there.
00:12:53.856,00:12:57.151,"For centuries, no elf has ever left Elfwood."
00:12:57.234,00:13:00.029,"-Except Leavo. -Speak no more of Leavo, Speako!"
00:13:00.112,00:13:02.323,Please don't open it.
00:13:02.406,00:13:07.077,All will be forgiven as long as you obey the Jolly Code.
00:13:07.161,00:13:10.331,Ugh... Scribeldy-scrobeldy-screw the Jolly Code!
00:13:11.791,00:13:14.502,I wanna taste something other than sweetness.
00:13:14.585,00:13:18.589,"I want to cry salty tears, learn bitter truths."
00:13:18.672,00:13:23.135,"I want to take a big, meaty bite out of life and dip it in mustard."
00:13:23.219,00:13:28.057,"Mustard, vinegar, anchovies? These are the ravings of fools."
00:13:47.910,00:13:51.288,"Take one step further, you're on your own."
00:13:51.372,00:13:55.000,"No elf has ever returned, not even Returno."
00:13:55.084,00:13:57.253,"Elfo, you'll die out there."
00:13:57.962,00:14:01.799,I'd rather die a big death than live a small life.
00:14:21.902,00:14:22.736,Wow.
00:14:22.820,00:14:37.585,"For the first time in my life, I feel completely calm and-- Personal demon."
00:14:37.668,00:14:39.670,"-So, you'll do my bidding? -Uh, no."
00:14:39.753,00:14:44.133,I'm a princess. I can't do my own bidding. How are you even useful?
00:14:44.216,00:14:45.467,Okay. Hmm.
00:14:45.551,00:14:48.387,You know that voice in your head that says to do the right thing?
00:14:48.470,00:14:50.139,I'm the guy yelling over it.
00:14:50.222,00:14:54.560,"Yeah, I'm the guy that makes you feel good about doing bad things."
00:14:54.643,00:14:57.521,-You're like a terrible friend? -I never said I'm your friend.
00:14:59.189,00:15:02.026,It's not even about me. It's about the stupid alliance.
00:15:02.109,00:15:05.321,Shame you're a princess and too dainty to do anything about it.
00:15:10.534,00:15:14.204,"I think you'll be very pleased with the revised cake, Your Highness."
00:15:15.956,00:15:19.168,Nice likeness. Competent latticework.
00:15:19.251,00:15:23.088,"Moving down, sugar columns seem structurally sound."
00:15:23.172,00:15:27.968,Back looks good. And just a cursory glance at the bottom tier.
00:15:28.052,00:15:29.219,And it says...
00:15:29.303,00:15:31.221,"Get Bent, Dad."
00:15:31.305,00:15:33.057,Isn't that... What?
00:15:33.641,00:15:35.017,Bean!
00:15:44.068,00:16:01.627,"Now, a cousin to caramel is nougat, which essentially is-- Oh. Hi, I'm Elfo. And you are?"
00:16:01.710,00:16:03.504,Busy. We're at war here.
00:16:03.587,00:16:04.505,What's war?
00:16:13.055,00:16:14.431,Wee!
00:16:20.229,00:16:21.397,Yikes.
00:16:22.356,00:16:23.190,Huh?
00:16:44.378,00:16:45.796,"Hi, I'm Elfo."
00:16:50.300,00:16:51.677,Yeow!
00:16:57.266,00:17:01.270,"Well, I like war, but I wouldn't say I love it."
00:17:21.290,00:17:22.124,Wha...
00:17:23.542,00:17:25.961,-I'm glad you can't see this. Bye! -Huh?
00:17:31.967,00:17:33.260,-Oh! -Ah!
00:17:33.343,00:17:36.430,"Tonight is wedding night, so is time we had talk."
00:17:36.513,00:17:39.516,-I know I am not your mother. -Please don't.
00:17:39.600,00:17:42.895,"-But I do have sex with your father. -God, Oona. Ew."
00:17:42.978,00:17:45.898,I do not need a sex talk from my stepmother.
00:17:45.981,00:17:49.777,"Tonight, you will be expect to perform your wifely duties."
00:17:49.860,00:17:53.197,I mention because it was difficult for me with the tentacles.
00:17:53.280,00:17:54.615,I don't have tentacles.
00:17:54.698,00:17:56.950,Your husband will have tentacles.
00:17:57.034,00:17:59.119,Are you trying to say testicles?
00:17:59.203,00:18:03.290,I don't know. Just leave your eggs on the nightstand and get out of there.
00:18:07.419,00:18:08.462,Hmm.
00:18:22.309,00:18:24.061,"Man, I'm starving."
00:18:24.144,00:18:27.231,I should've grabbed one of those gumdrops when they were hanging me.
00:18:32.820,00:18:35.364,"I'm Elfo, by the way. What's your name?"
00:18:35.447,00:18:37.032,We are but humble people.
00:18:37.116,00:18:39.493,"We have no names, but you can call me Farmer."
00:18:39.576,00:18:43.664,"Our food is not flavorful, but we humbly offer it for your sustenance."
00:18:43.747,00:18:46.208,Are you kidding me? This stuff looks amazing.
00:18:46.291,00:18:47.835,All I've ever eaten is candy.
00:18:47.918,00:18:50.003,Candy? Are you a king?
00:18:51.922,00:18:53.757,Mmm. Mmm! Oh!
00:18:53.841,00:18:56.510,I am sorry our food will bring you no joy.
00:18:56.593,00:18:57.678,This is delicious!
00:18:57.761,00:19:01.014,"I beg you, sir. We are far too humble to receive praise."
00:19:01.098,00:19:03.475,I can't help it. You deserve praise.
00:19:07.187,00:19:11.525,-It's so incredibly good! -Now you've praised us too far.
00:19:11.608,00:19:14.361,"-You must leave our humble home! -Get out, praiser."
00:19:15.779,00:19:18.157,Thanks again! It was delicious!
00:19:18.240,00:19:20.159,You're ruining our lives!
00:19:37.050,00:19:38.427,What do you see?
00:19:38.510,00:19:41.054,Ooh! Everybody got shoes.
00:19:50.647,00:19:52.107,That's communion wine.
00:19:54.526,00:19:56.987,"-You could use some, though. -I really shouldn't."
00:19:57.070,00:20:01.033,Times when you really shouldn't are exactly when you really should.
00:20:04.620,00:20:09.082,Drinking wine with a demon. Not exactly the wedding day I wished for.
00:20:16.632,00:20:17.466,Hmm!
00:20:22.721,00:20:24.932,I'm supposed to be surrounded by people I like.
00:20:25.015,00:20:26.600,I don't even have my real mother.
00:20:28.936,00:20:31.271,Who needs a mother when you've got bridesmaids?
00:20:31.772,00:20:33.315,-No bridesmaids? -No.
00:20:33.398,00:20:34.858,-How about friends? -Uh-uh.
00:20:34.942,00:20:36.276,Only drinking buddies.
00:20:37.110,00:20:38.278,To drinking buddies.
00:20:38.362,00:20:40.948,Better than bridesmaids. Better than mothers.
00:20:41.031,00:20:43.951,I was raised by a pack of drinking buddies.
00:20:45.744,00:20:47.454,And I came out perfect.
00:20:49.790,00:21:07.766,"Dearly beloved, as we stand here in this overly large building, designed to make us feel small and inadequate, we ask the invisible God we think is up there, to watch over us if He, She, or It is even capable of things like watching over us..."
00:21:07.849,00:21:10.394,This religion is still in its early stages.
00:21:10.477,00:21:17.651,"Nobody knows anything for sure, but if I talk with confidence, you dopes will believe anything I say."
00:21:20.279,00:21:21.321,Whoa! Pops.
00:21:25.617,00:21:28.620,"Me? Ow. Meow. That's what cats say, right?"
00:21:28.704,00:21:30.455,I'm not here to answer cat questions.
00:21:31.456,00:21:34.001,"Now get up and make your dad proud, you drunk."
00:21:36.628,00:21:38.880,-Are you trying to make a jerk out of me? -Yes.
00:21:46.638,00:21:48.098,Wow!
00:21:48.181,00:21:49.975,It's so small.
00:21:58.817,00:22:08.118,"Do you, Guysbert, most Exalted Prince of Bentwood, Slayer of Metallica, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
00:22:08.201,00:22:09.786,Duh...
00:22:09.870,00:22:10.912,Okay.
00:22:10.996,00:22:17.836,"And do you, Princess Tiabeanie, a single woman, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?"
00:22:27.637,00:22:28.930,No!
00:22:34.936,00:22:35.771,Ah.
00:22:42.611,00:22:44.279,He's dead.
00:22:44.363,00:22:48.658,"Uh, I think I'm still alive. No, wait. Nevermind."
00:22:48.742,00:22:50.327,I want my gift back.
00:22:56.666,00:22:59.461,-This wedding is all messed up. -We've got to save the alliance.
00:22:59.544,00:23:01.338,-What are we gonna do? -We've got another son.
00:23:01.421,00:23:03.173,Why didn't you say so? What's his name?
00:23:06.259,00:23:08.303,"Okay, watch this. Here we go."
00:23:16.561,00:23:19.356,we've decided the princess can still marry.
00:23:19.439,00:23:20.357,What?
00:23:20.440,00:23:27.406,"Presenting Guysbert's younger brother, the new heir to the throne of Bentwood, Prince Merkimer."
00:23:27.489,00:23:28.615,Don't be sad.
00:23:28.698,00:23:30.659,She would have left him for me anyway.
00:23:30.742,00:23:35.205,"Uh... Actually, I'd be fine if someone could just slide my head up a bit."
00:23:35.288,00:23:37.707,Hush! There's a wedding in progress.
00:23:38.792,00:23:46.216,"Do you, Prince Merkimer of Bentwood-- You gotta be kidding me. Father, you can't make me-- The king can make anyone!"
00:23:46.299,00:23:48.301,You do. You do.
00:23:48.969,00:23:50.303,Say man and wife.
00:23:50.387,00:24:00.021,I now pronounce you man and-- What are all your names?
00:24:00.105,00:24:01.273,What the hell is that?
00:24:01.356,00:24:03.191,-An elf. -A magical elf.
00:24:03.275,00:24:05.694,Elves haven't been seen in centuries.
00:24:05.777,00:24:07.571,Imagine the possibilities.
00:24:07.654,00:24:11.241,"With elf magic, I could progress far beyond card tricks."
00:24:12.701,00:24:16.163,A shiny gold Zog to whoever seizes the elf.
00:24:20.709,00:24:22.669,"Oh, I'll get you, wee elf!"
00:24:23.879,00:24:24.713,Oh!
00:24:25.630,00:24:26.465,Ah!
00:24:52.449,00:24:53.408,So how'd it go?
00:24:56.161,00:24:57.621,"That good, huh?"
00:24:59.414,00:25:03.460,The wedding is ruined. The demon is performing exquisitely.
00:25:03.543,00:25:08.507,But look. There's a complication. They've been joined by a tiny dork.
00:25:08.590,00:25:09.424,Ow.
00:25:09.508,00:25:11.801,"It's fire, Cloyd. It's hot."
00:25:11.885,00:25:14.346,I know. I was there.
00:25:17.265,00:25:20.393,Elfo has left the building with Bean.
00:25:20.477,00:25:24.356,"No worry. I'm an expert hunter, and I'll track down the woman I love."
00:25:24.439,00:25:25.899,Keep the champagne chilled.
00:25:25.982,00:25:28.735,I shall return before the last uncle passes out.
00:25:28.818,00:25:32.405,My Knights of the Zog Table will aid you. Knights!
00:25:33.907,00:25:36.576,"Pendergast, who are your best trackers?"
00:25:36.660,00:25:38.954,"That would be Stryker and Bolt, sire."
00:25:39.037,00:25:42.040,"But they're lost, so, it'll be Turbish and Mertz."
00:25:43.124,00:25:45.377,We won't get tired this time.
00:26:06.147,00:26:09.859,"It was sweet of you to wreck my wedding, but you're kind of slowing us down."
00:26:09.943,00:26:11.278,Mind if I give you a ride?
00:26:11.361,00:26:13.405,Mind? I don't mind at all.
00:26:24.124,00:26:42.434,"Well, it took all day, but I finally got my winnings-- Stand back, chumps."
00:26:42.517,00:26:45.145,Watch as a non-chump chumps these chumps.
00:27:04.623,00:27:07.375,"Before today, we had neither riches nor magic."
00:27:07.459,00:27:12.130,"Then today, for one blessed second, we almost had both."
00:27:12.213,00:27:13.882,And now you got bupkis!
00:27:15.425,00:27:16.885,"Oh, no."
00:27:31.399,00:27:32.901,"Ow, ow, ow!"
00:27:34.486,00:27:35.487,Why me?
00:28:01.221,00:28:04.683,I've never had a nightmare. Is this one?
00:28:15.694,00:28:18.613,-Where did they go? -Only one place they could have gone.
00:28:18.697,00:28:19.864,Start digging.
00:28:22.283,00:28:25.495,I won't even dignify that with an upward glance.
00:28:32.752,00:28:36.339,I haven't seen you in this tree before. You looking for a good time?
00:28:36.423,00:28:39.676,A fairy? Maybe she can help us. Do you do magic?
00:28:39.759,00:28:43.179,"Sure, I've done a trick or two. What do you have in mind?"
00:28:43.263,00:28:48.601,"I was forced into a wedding, and I wish I had my freedom to-- Hey, I'm gonna stop you right there."
00:28:48.685,00:28:51.354,Wishes sound free. I don't do free.
00:28:51.438,00:28:55.024,But you look like sweet kids. You ever heard of the Wishmaster?
00:28:55.108,00:28:56.735,I've never heard of anything.
00:28:56.818,00:28:59.028,It's true. He just thinks you're a real friendly lady.
00:28:59.112,00:29:01.614,An old girlfriend of mine used to work the mountain.
00:29:01.698,00:29:05.785,She said this Wishmaster guy was the real deal. Thataway.
00:29:05.869,00:29:09.122,This is so helpful. How can we ever repay you?
00:29:09.205,00:29:11.374,Cash. Leave it on the branch.
00:29:23.762,00:29:26.806,"Cool night air, sky full of stars..."
00:29:27.390,00:29:29.225,This sucks. How much further?
00:29:32.103,00:29:34.230,"It's getting late, boys. We'd better stay here."
00:29:41.237,00:29:49.704,"Okay, so if we get three wishes, I want to be in charge of my own destiny, to have my mom back, obviously, and to find a boyfriend who's a great listener."
00:29:49.788,00:29:51.122,"What do you wish for, Elfo?"
00:29:51.206,00:29:52.415,To be a great listener.
00:29:52.499,00:29:55.418,And whatever that thing is you said about your mom.
00:29:55.502,00:30:01.007,"I would get rid of all the diseases plaguing mankind, and replace them with worse ones."
00:30:01.090,00:30:02.842,Ooh! And make Elfo die alone.
00:30:02.926,00:30:06.221,"Hey, he's making fun of my dreams."
00:30:06.304,00:30:08.097,That's what friends do.
00:30:08.181,00:30:11.601,We got a long journey in the morning. Let's get some shut-eye.
00:30:11.684,00:30:14.687,You two sleep down by my feet. I call it the friend zone.
00:30:14.771,00:30:17.315,Get comfortable. You ain't never getting outta here.
00:30:18.441,00:30:21.486,What's this weird feeling I don't want to drink away?
00:30:21.569,00:30:23.446,That's hope. That's hope!
00:30:23.530,00:30:26.241,You know what we say in Hell? Hope's for dopes.
00:30:28.993,00:30:32.247,I'll be entering your dreams tonight in the form of a laughing skull.
00:30:44.467,00:30:47.971,An elf with a human girl? That ain't right.
00:31:01.609,00:31:02.443,Ah...
00:31:08.700,00:31:11.494,"Mmm... Guys, hey! Wake up."
00:31:11.578,00:31:15.039,Come on. We've got a long way to go to the Wishmaster's lair.
00:31:16.624,00:31:17.458,Oh.
00:31:23.214,00:31:24.799,I wish you guys would help.
00:31:24.883,00:31:26.259,Save it for the Wishmaster.
00:31:51.117,00:31:52.368,Seek ye me?
00:31:52.452,00:31:55.622,"Yes, are you-- The Washmaster."
00:31:55.705,00:31:57.457,"Wait, the what-master?"
00:31:57.540,00:31:59.250,You heard me. The Washmaster.
00:31:59.334,00:32:03.087,People far and wide seek me out to wash their clothes.
00:32:06.549,00:32:07.717,No!
00:32:07.800,00:32:11.220,"Well, now we know something we didn't know yesterday."
00:32:15.808,00:32:20.146,"Ah, there you are, my love. I've come to take you back to our wedding."
00:32:59.894,00:33:00.728,Ah!
00:33:04.941,00:33:13.700,I might as well give up and accept that I'll never be anything more than a wealthy queen It's my destiny.
00:33:13.783,00:33:15.284,"Bean, no!"
00:33:15.368,00:33:21.791,"You are beautiful, and your skin is so soft, and your hair smells like butterscotch, but you're wrong!"
00:33:21.874,00:33:25.378,"Pardon my language, but destiny is baloney!"
00:33:25.461,00:33:28.715,Your future is not foretold. It's what you make of it.
00:33:30.383,00:33:31.884,Let's make a future together.
00:33:31.968,00:33:35.096,I've loved you since the moment you killed my brother.
00:33:38.891,00:33:41.436,"Give me your hand in marriage, Bean."
00:33:52.447,00:33:53.448,Ah...
00:33:53.531,00:33:55.742,"-You're magic, right? -Yep."
00:33:56.826,00:33:58.453,"Not that kind of magic, though."
00:33:58.536,00:34:01.289,-What about you? -Maybe I am.
00:34:02.206,00:34:03.041,Nope.
00:00:25.525,00:00:26.651,Bean! No!
00:00:26.735,00:00:28.528,She forgot her glove!
00:00:28.611,00:00:30.864,My poor Princess Tiabeanie.
00:00:30.947,00:00:33.283,She never had a chance to say she loved me.
00:00:34.617,00:00:35.744,Now what? Whoa!
00:00:37.579,00:00:39.664,Me smell fear.
00:00:41.499,00:00:45.295,"You don't scare me! I was born scared. Get him, men!"
00:00:57.849,00:01:00.185,There's no conflict here.
00:01:00.810,00:01:03.313,This is a plateau of peace.
00:01:17.243,00:01:21.748,I can get married or I can die. This should be a harder decision.
00:01:21.831,00:01:23.708,Hey! Death is the easy way out!
00:01:23.792,00:01:26.795,"So I say do it. Do it! Do it, do it, do it!"
00:01:26.878,00:01:29.756,"No! Your cruddy life is worth living, Bean."
00:01:29.839,00:01:32.383,"And so is mine, if you live."
00:01:32.467,00:01:34.719,Ugh. Geez. Do it.
00:01:34.803,00:01:35.804,"Hey, guys?"
00:01:36.805,00:01:38.807,"Uh, while you were talking, the stick broke."
00:01:43.228,00:01:46.564,Leaving when the ogre looked away was an excellent strategy.
00:01:46.648,00:01:50.902,"Now, by my reckoning, the bodies should have landed right here."
00:01:51.402,00:01:52.237,Whoa!
00:01:54.364,00:01:57.992,"Dear God, you've mangled my exquisite face!"
00:01:58.076,00:02:00.078,"Wait, no, that's your face."
00:02:00.161,00:02:01.246,What's wrong with my face?
00:02:01.329,00:02:04.791,"It looks like a foot. I mean, if you're happy with it..."
00:02:04.874,00:02:05.875,Whoa!
00:02:22.684,00:02:27.105,And that's when I discovered that the dragon could shoot fire from both ends.
00:02:27.188,00:02:29.607,"Anyway, enough about every detail of my life."
00:02:29.691,00:02:31.234,Tell me something about you.
00:02:40.577,00:02:47.584,"Your Majesty, it is with much heroism that I now return Princess Bean, along with this priceless sack of elf."
00:02:47.667,00:02:48.835,Ah! Uh.
00:02:48.918,00:02:51.838,This cold floor feels good on my concussion.
00:02:51.921,00:02:53.381,"Hi, I'm Elfo!"
00:02:53.464,00:02:56.968,"But more importantly, I am the one and only Luci."
00:02:57.051,00:02:59.220,Who cares what a cat has to say?
00:03:00.471,00:03:01.431,I'm not a cat!
00:03:01.514,00:03:03.641,"Ah, whatever. I'm gonna go lay down in the window."
00:03:03.725,00:03:06.895,"All I care about is this sweet, precious elf."
00:03:06.978,00:03:08.271,Cram him in a cage!
00:03:08.938,00:03:12.192,"Dad, you can't just cage him. Elves are jolly by nature."
00:03:12.275,00:03:14.402,They need to prance and dance.
00:03:14.485,00:03:17.155,"Lucky for you, I'm a patron of the arts."
00:03:21.201,00:03:25.205,But all frolicking stays within castle walls.
00:03:25.288,00:03:27.123,"Well, get to it!"
00:03:44.557,00:03:47.268,"It's still rolling, but he has stopped screaming."
00:03:47.352,00:03:50.688,"Someone jab him with a sword, make sure he's okay."
00:03:50.772,00:03:53.816,"Speaking of things getting poked, we've got a wedding to plan."
00:03:53.900,00:03:59.948,"Ew. Dad, think out the words before they come out. It's-- I know. It felt weird when I said it."
00:04:05.912,00:04:10.250,"We'll scrub you right up, as clean as a child on his funeral day."
00:04:10.333,00:04:11.251,Arms up!
00:04:11.751,00:04:16.089,Oh. How my Charlie sparkled this morning when they heaved him into the burial pit.
00:04:16.172,00:04:17.674,He's in a better place now.
00:04:17.757,00:04:20.802,"Oh, yes, down there with all his little friends."
00:04:20.885,00:04:22.387,Ah. Not so hard!
00:04:22.470,00:04:23.888,"I'm sorry, Bunty."
00:04:23.972,00:04:26.849,I don't mean to be insensitive about your dead whatever.
00:04:26.933,00:04:29.102,I just really don't want to marry this wealthy prince.
00:04:29.185,00:04:30.186,You understand.
00:04:30.270,00:04:32.480,But it is your duty as a princess.
00:04:32.563,00:04:35.566,We need this marriage to cement our alliance with Bentwood.
00:04:35.650,00:04:41.155,"For our kingdom is rich in tradition, but their kingdom is rich in... Well, riches."
00:04:41.239,00:04:45.243,"Plus, I don't see anyone else storming your castle, princess."
00:04:46.119,00:04:47.287,Rawr.
00:04:58.047,00:04:59.716,-Your Highness. -Eh?
00:04:59.799,00:05:03.219,The elf may have value far beyond what we expected.
00:05:03.303,00:05:04.137,Uh...
00:05:04.220,00:05:08.016,It appears there may be truth to the old legends regarding the elves.
00:05:08.099,00:05:13.438,It seems certain secrets were set down in the ancient writings of Mephismo.
00:05:15.982,00:05:17.942,I should dust in here more often.
00:05:18.026,00:05:19.569,"Anyway, I've read it before."
00:05:19.652,00:05:24.490,The essence is that there is enormously potent magic in elves' blood.
00:05:26.200,00:05:29.412,Could this elf's blood be the key to my wildest dream?
00:05:29.495,00:05:34.083,Might we finally create the Elixir of Life?
00:05:34.167,00:05:36.252,I don't want to raise your hopes.
00:05:36.336,00:05:38.755,"But yes, definitely."
00:05:44.761,00:05:47.180,"Hey, Elfo, what are you lookin' at?"
00:05:49.015,00:05:53.144,I was just admiring the towel. My people don't have terrycloth.
00:05:56.939,00:05:59.233,I'm gonna have to kill him or something.
00:05:59.317,00:06:00.902,"Do it. Do it, do it, do it!"
00:06:00.985,00:06:02.987,And after you kill him we can hide the body.
00:06:03.071,00:06:06.741,Then we could join the search party and you and I can look at each other and try not to laugh.
00:06:07.325,00:06:11.871,"No! You're not a murderer, Bean! Well, I mean, you did kill that one guy."
00:06:11.954,00:06:16.000,"Nope. Still alive, but suffering greatly."
00:06:16.084,00:06:17.835,You're a sweet person.
00:06:17.919,00:06:21.422,"Sure, you're a violent alcoholic, but you're not a killer."
00:06:21.506,00:06:24.509,You're right. I'll go have a few drinks and we'll figure something out.
00:06:26.928,00:06:28.137,Oh.
00:06:28.221,00:06:30.181,"Hey, I'm still naked."
00:06:30.264,00:06:32.100,I'm naked all the time. You just didn't know it.
00:06:32.183,00:06:33.726,And now you're never gonna un-know it.
00:06:35.686,00:06:38.856,"Uh, might we borrow this little man for a moment?"
00:06:38.940,00:06:40.650,I just need to pick his brain.
00:06:41.275,00:06:43.277,Through his nostrils.
00:06:43.861,00:06:45.947,"So, how we gonna kill your fiancé?"
00:06:46.030,00:06:48.616,Candlestick in the conservatory? Candlestick in the face?
00:06:48.699,00:06:50.993,I think we need to be a little bit more discreet.
00:06:51.077,00:06:53.371,Oh. Poison could be perfect!
00:06:56.082,00:06:58.501,"This one causes slow, painful death."
00:06:58.584,00:07:01.879,This one kills you with kindness and some belladonna.
00:07:05.550,00:07:06.884,Oh. Excuse me.
00:07:10.888,00:07:12.181,Have you folks been helped?
00:07:12.265,00:07:13.516,We're still browsing.
00:07:13.599,00:07:16.561,"Uh, you know what? I'm just not comfortable with murder."
00:07:16.644,00:07:18.688,There's got to be another way to get rid of him.
00:07:18.771,00:07:21.691,You could just marry him and drive him mad with your indecisiveness.
00:07:21.774,00:07:22.608,Hmm.
00:07:22.692,00:07:23.776,I don't know.
00:07:30.950,00:07:34.120,What if I rub a sick chicken all over his face and hope for the best?
00:07:41.627,00:07:43.546,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
00:07:51.888,00:07:56.017,"Behold, sire, as I extract a small quantity of blood."
00:07:56.100,00:07:58.436,I only have a small quantity of blood.
00:08:06.611,00:08:11.657,Excellent. I've asked the eminent Lord Lingonberry to take part in the experiment.
00:08:11.741,00:08:17.288,And may I say what a deep honor it is to assist His Majesty in this most-- Strap him down!
00:08:17.872,00:08:21.292,This is the first interesting thing that's ever happened to me.
00:08:21.375,00:08:30.468,"To test the revitalizing influence of the blood, I shall apply a small measure to the scalp to regrow his Lordship's once-lavish hair."
00:08:30.551,00:08:33.095,And... doink.
00:08:36.974,00:08:38.267,Nothing's happening.
00:08:38.351,00:08:41.020,"But, ho! Some hair has sprouted in his ear."
00:08:41.103,00:08:43.231,His ears were always like that!
00:08:43.314,00:08:45.608,It's like he keeps paintbrushes in there.
00:08:45.691,00:08:49.487,"Yes, well, I suppose the life-giving magic may take a while."
00:08:49.570,00:08:52.323,"Uh, come back in a few days, Lord Lingonberry."
00:08:54.367,00:08:55.368,He's dead.
00:08:55.451,00:08:59.205,Pity. He was a good man. A family man.
00:09:04.669,00:09:07.380,"Clearly, the volume of blood was inadequate."
00:09:07.463,00:09:11.801,"To extract greater quantities, we'll need more sophisticated methods."
00:09:11.884,00:09:13.594,"Mop Girl, milk him."
00:09:16.681,00:09:19.433,My brain feels dry.
00:09:24.355,00:09:28.651,Now we hope Merkimer's a big enough idiot to fall for this mermaid plan.
00:09:28.734,00:09:30.278,I'm feeling optimistic.
00:09:37.034,00:09:41.622,and some would say overflowing with revulsion-- That's okay. I don't listen to women.
00:09:41.706,00:09:46.210,But before we marry and I enter a state of semi-permanent pregnancy...
00:09:48.546,00:09:51.340,I just wanted to make sure you have some fun.
00:09:51.424,00:09:55.595,That's why I insist you have a bachelor party.
00:09:55.678,00:10:01.392,It'll be way out on the open seas where the only law is the law of no laws.
00:10:02.310,00:10:03.978,Anything goes.
00:10:04.687,00:10:08.024,Anything... goes.
00:10:09.859,00:10:12.945,Anything goes!
00:10:13.029,00:10:13.863,Whoa!
00:10:13.946,00:10:19.118,"They call it a party barge, and it's charting a course for Mermaid Island."
00:10:19.201,00:10:20.995,This island has real mermaids?
00:10:21.078,00:10:23.497,It's not just named after Gerald K. Mermaid?
00:10:23.581,00:10:26.834,"It was named after him, but it also has mermaids."
00:10:26.917,00:10:31.339,Intriguing. But don't mermaids use their mesmo-songs to lure men to their deaths?
00:10:31.422,00:10:34.133,"Ah, only weak-minded men fall for that."
00:10:34.216,00:10:36.093,So you'll be pretty much fine.
00:10:36.177,00:10:38.721,Very well. I'm in.
00:10:38.804,00:10:40.681,What a gullible idiot.
00:10:40.765,00:10:41.974,"Can I go, too?"
00:10:44.852,00:10:48.481,Our first experiment with the elf blood was inconclusive.
00:10:48.564,00:10:52.652,But these new tests shall reveal its restorative powers.
00:10:59.575,00:11:00.409,Hmm.
00:11:02.578,00:11:03.579,Fly!
00:11:06.040,00:11:06.874,Oh.
00:11:24.725,00:11:26.811,"Elfo, that's not possible."
00:11:27.395,00:11:31.023,Why don't you pick on someone your own size? Like a barn!
00:11:31.107,00:11:33.484,"First of all, sweetie, shut up."
00:11:33.567,00:11:37.655,I'm not gonna hurt this little guy. I'm gonna leech the magic out of him.
00:11:37.738,00:11:39.865,Don't you want a magic daddy?
00:11:39.949,00:11:45.413,"No! Gosh. I don't want a magic daddy, and I would never call you that even if you were!"
00:11:45.496,00:11:50.584,You just want your stupid Elixir of Life so you can be immortal and rule forever.
00:11:50.668,00:11:52.586,"God, you're selfish and cruel."
00:11:52.670,00:11:55.631,Selfish? Maybe. But cruel?
00:11:55.715,00:11:57.049,"Ah, also maybe."
00:11:57.133,00:12:00.219,"Sire, harnessing the blood's power has proven difficult."
00:12:00.302,00:12:02.471,Perhaps if I had more to work with...
00:12:06.392,00:12:12.857,"If this flask isn't filled with elf blood by morning, we'll grind him to a paste and see if that works better."
00:12:13.691,00:12:17.445,"Oh! If that paste doesn't work, I'm in real trouble."
00:12:23.993,00:12:27.788,I'm an optimist. I say the flask is half-full.
00:12:27.872,00:12:29.790,-It's not. -Don't be so negative.
00:12:29.874,00:12:32.293,"-Where there's a will, there's a way. -There's not."
00:12:42.470,00:12:46.849,"Shut your snouts, you dumb pigs, or I'm gonna... Oh, wait."
00:12:58.110,00:13:00.738,Did you know that pigs are 80% blood?
00:13:00.821,00:13:03.240,-Really? -Not anymore.
00:13:08.746,00:13:13.834,"I must admit, the quantity of blood exceeded my expectations."
00:13:13.918,00:13:17.213,So Elfo is free to go?
00:13:17.296,00:13:18.255,Hmm.
00:13:18.339,00:13:19.423,For now.
00:13:19.507,00:13:22.134,Looks like I picked the wrong day to wear sandals.
00:13:27.848,00:13:30.184,Was I the only one hoping for more blood?
00:13:30.267,00:13:32.144,I feel weak and queasy.
00:13:32.228,00:13:35.523,"What you need is a nice, long boat ride."
00:13:45.658,00:13:50.704,All aboard the party barge! I hope you like fun and soggy pretzels.
00:13:53.332,00:13:55.960,I hope you like me yelling!
00:13:56.043,00:13:57.795,"Stop right there, Your Ladyness."
00:13:57.878,00:14:03.425,A delicate flower like yourself has no place aboard-- Good point.
00:14:05.845,00:14:07.847,"I'm so glad you're coming along, Bean."
00:14:07.930,00:14:13.686,"You'll get to know the crazy, fun me, before spending the rest of your life with the boring, bossy me."
00:14:13.769,00:14:15.771,I'm lucky in so many ways.
00:14:20.526,00:14:25.281,"This may be a party barge, but the dangers of Mermaid Island be all too real."
00:14:25.364,00:14:27.449,So drink responsibly!
00:14:42.464,00:14:45.009,Attention on the party barge!
00:14:45.092,00:14:48.178,We be sailing now into treacherous waters.
00:14:48.262,00:14:51.015,"To starboard, man-eating sharks."
00:14:51.098,00:14:56.312,"To port, a sunset so beautiful the rest of your life will seem anticlimactic."
00:14:56.395,00:14:58.272,But the worst lies ahead!
00:14:58.355,00:15:03.068,For there lurk the twin shores of Mermaid Island and Walrus Island.
00:15:03.152,00:15:06.447,"And you don't want to mix those up, believe me."
00:15:06.530,00:15:08.949,"Let's get this underway, shall we?"
00:15:09.033,00:15:12.494,Everyone line up single file to get lashed to the masts.
00:15:12.578,00:15:14.580,God forbid you lose control and jump overboard.
00:15:14.663,00:15:15.497,We don't want that.
00:15:22.004,00:15:24.924,Anyone not tied down better plug your ears.
00:15:25.007,00:15:28.177,Ear wax? Does it mean it's for ears or from ears?
00:15:28.260,00:15:31.722,"Arr, you'll want to put the wax in before you hear me answer."
00:15:35.893,00:15:39.647,"Tighter, man, tighter! I have poor impulse control."
00:15:42.066,00:15:43.609,"You remembered to use a slipknot, right?"
00:15:43.692,00:15:47.363,I can't hear you! I've got wax in my ears!
00:15:47.446,00:15:51.116,"You rigged it so he'll break free and leap overboard, right?"
00:15:51.200,00:15:52.117,The plan?
00:15:52.201,00:15:54.203,"Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:54.286,00:15:57.164,"Well, no. I couldn't do it."
00:15:57.247,00:15:58.082,Ugh.
00:15:58.165,00:16:00.751,Elf defense? Try self-defense.
00:16:00.834,00:16:01.919,Just go cut the ropes.
00:16:04.588,00:16:07.091,-I can't jump that high. -Do it! Elfo...
00:16:07.174,00:16:09.176,-That's not fair. -Don't listen to Elfo.
00:16:09.259,00:16:11.261,"You're playing to your strengths, and not mine."
00:16:16.976,00:16:20.020,Then they shouldn't have given me these big bad buck teeth.
00:16:21.772,00:16:26.402,"My prince, may I give you one last kiss for good luck?"
00:16:26.485,00:16:28.904,"On the forearm, for whatever reason?"
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.699,"That's kind of Mother's thing, but sure."
00:16:37.246,00:16:38.080,Did it work?
00:16:39.331,00:16:44.378,"All hands, brace fer mermaids! And their irresistible song."
00:16:45.129,00:16:47.715,"If it's smooth jazz, I will destroy this place."
00:16:57.057,00:16:59.435,-Oh. -Oh.
00:16:59.977,00:17:03.397,It's beautiful. Such angelic voices.
00:17:03.480,00:17:06.775,I've never heard a song so sweet and delicate.
00:17:06.859,00:17:09.278,I must have sex with its origin.
00:17:18.162,00:17:21.040,"Ha! I'm free! Lead the way, loins."
00:17:29.048,00:17:33.594,"I'm Merkimer. I can't wait to meet you. I don't need your names, though."
00:17:38.849,00:17:41.685,"Ladies, the legends do not do you justice."
00:17:41.769,00:17:46.148,Not one mention of your fuzzy muzzles. Climb aboard.
00:17:49.860,00:17:51.528,Yes!
00:17:51.612,00:17:54.198,Uh... Should we be doing something?
00:17:54.281,00:17:56.825,I'm already smoking and laughing. What more do you want?
00:18:01.914,00:18:03.791,Listen. They've stopped singing.
00:18:05.000,00:18:08.420,"Aye, their siren song is done for now."
00:18:08.504,00:18:11.882,And we only lost one man. That's actually not bad.
00:18:26.188,00:18:30.109,"As Merkimer's fiancée, I'd like to say a few words."
00:18:30.901,00:18:32.486,Let's head back.
00:18:37.116,00:18:40.494,Chowder? It doesn't always have to be nautical references with me.
00:18:40.577,00:18:45.124,"There are plenty of other thick soups. Cream of potato, that's one."
00:18:45.207,00:18:48.418,Uh... Chili... I guess that's not a soup.
00:18:48.502,00:18:52.131,"Uh... Ham chowder. No, that's a chowder. Uh..."
00:18:52.214,00:18:53.715,What's the one with the salt?
00:18:57.928,00:18:58.762,Bah!
00:18:58.846,00:19:01.640,"Look, in the distance! The lights of the kingdom!"
00:19:05.978,00:19:07.062,That's no land.
00:19:07.146,00:19:11.066,"It's a ship of war, flying the dread flag of the Borcs!"
00:19:15.320,00:19:20.993,Don't panic. We can slip away unnoticed as long as everyone remains absolutely silent.
00:19:29.168,00:19:32.963,They've spotted us. Defend the barge or risk losing your deposit.
00:19:33.964,00:19:35.299,Fire the cannon!
00:19:38.594,00:19:40.721,Don't look at that. You didn't pay for it.
00:19:48.687,00:19:51.690,"I'm sorry, guys. We're gonna die and it's all my fault."
00:19:51.773,00:19:55.068,"No, it was me with my incessant do it, do it, do it, do its."
00:19:55.152,00:19:56.445,That's what made you do it.
00:19:56.528,00:20:00.824,Neither one of you was to blame. It was both of you. You both killed us.
00:20:02.159,00:20:04.369,The barge is falling apart!
00:20:04.453,00:20:07.664,"Aye, 'twas held together mainly by stains."
00:20:17.758,00:20:21.637,All the confetti cannons in the world couldn't save us now.
00:20:26.350,00:20:28.143,"Mermaids, attack!"
00:20:54.461,00:20:57.589,Didn't you always want a husband that screwed 30 walruses?
00:20:57.673,00:20:59.091,"Yeah. Yeah, I did."
00:21:07.766,00:21:13.814,"King Zog, you're giving me your daughter, so it's only fair I give you something of equal value."
00:21:13.897,00:21:16.275,The head of the Borc admiral!
00:21:17.025,00:21:22.406,"That's not a Borc, it's a Bozak! They're our closest allies!"
00:21:22.489,00:21:24.950,The Bozak wedding delegation never arrived.
00:21:25.033,00:21:27.661,No wonder all those presents have been washing ashore.
00:21:31.248,00:21:34.835,Then let this be a warning to your other allies.
00:21:45.220,00:21:48.181,This is the dress my mom wore when she married my dad.
00:21:48.765,00:21:52.269,"I thought when it was my turn to wear it, I'd be as happy as she was."
00:21:52.352,00:21:55.355,"Somehow, I don't think my portrait's gonna be nearly as happy."
00:21:56.023,00:21:57.858,"If you no like, I fix."
00:21:57.941,00:22:01.486,"No, no, that's okay, Giuseppe. We hired you for your emotional realism."
00:22:04.656,00:22:05.907,It's time.
00:22:05.991,00:22:08.952,"Well, free will was fun while it lasted."
00:22:09.036,00:22:12.748,"Just doing the stuff I wanted to do, going places I wanted to go."
00:22:12.831,00:22:16.001,That time I stole a baby walrus. You guys were there.
00:22:16.084,00:22:19.880,"So, anyway, here comes the bride."
00:22:28.847,00:22:32.100,I can't bear to watch. I'll be in my cage.
00:22:53.121,00:22:54.623,Anyone seen Sorcerio?
00:22:54.706,00:22:57.959,"Ugh. No, he's at a wedding. Your wedding."
00:22:58.043,00:23:01.546,"Well, if it isn't my little barge buddy, Elmo."
00:23:01.630,00:23:06.510,"Ugh, I told you, my name is Elfo. Elmo was my house. I lived in an elm."
00:23:06.593,00:23:09.137,"I'm feeling a tad nervous, my tiny friend."
00:23:09.221,00:23:12.516,"Those mermaids worked me over pretty hard, sexually."
00:23:12.599,00:23:16.103,I may not be able to perform tonight on the marital mattress.
00:23:18.647,00:23:20.440,"I mean, I'm drained."
00:23:20.524,00:23:25.946,Haha! Here it is. Legend has it that elf blood contains the mystical essence of life itself.
00:23:26.029,00:23:29.282,"Perhaps it could perk up my poor, tuckered dong."
00:23:29.366,00:23:33.537,Please stop! There's no place like Elmo. There's no place like Elmo...
00:23:33.620,00:23:36.331,Mind if I have a little sip of you juice?
00:23:36.415,00:23:50.929,"Hold up. That's not elf's blood, that's pig's-- Enough rigmarole. Bring in the blushing groom."
00:23:55.600,00:23:58.061,I've never felt such vigor.
00:24:09.281,00:24:10.615,"Well, this is odd."
00:24:24.129,00:24:25.046,Hey.
00:24:29.718,00:24:32.345,You think this arranged marriage will solve your problems?
00:24:34.264,00:24:37.184,"You're just thinking about yourself, what you want."
00:24:37.267,00:24:38.852,You don't care about me.
00:24:38.935,00:24:44.524,"Isn't there a point in everyone's life where they need to, like, go and figure out who they are?"
00:24:44.608,00:24:48.570,Are we standing in that moment right now? Maybe.
00:24:48.653,00:25:01.124,"But I know one thing, and I know it real good, I know it really, really intensely, Or that one either."
00:25:01.208,00:25:05.545,"Ah, to hell with it. Bean may be crazy, but she's right."
00:25:05.629,00:25:07.881,This whole cursed wedding is canceled.
00:25:09.090,00:25:10.425,And the bar is closed.
00:25:11.801,00:25:15.013,"If you're calling off the wedding, I'm calling off the alliance!"
00:25:15.096,00:25:20.101,"Oh, yeah? My knuckles'll make an alliance with your pig-fathering face!"
00:25:23.772,00:25:25.524,-King fight! King fight! -Come on.
00:25:31.571,00:25:35.033,"Guys, thanks for making my wedding a day I'll always remember."
00:25:35.116,00:25:37.202,Now let's see how fast we can forget it.
00:00:27.360,00:00:30.405,"Actually, well is a bit of an overstatement."
00:00:30.488,00:00:37.120,"Acceptable is more like it, if you consider death, disease and rampant poverty acceptable."
00:00:37.203,00:00:39.873,Shut up! Do you know what time it is?
00:00:39.956,00:00:43.126,4:01 and all is well!
00:00:43.209,00:00:45.045,"Actually, well is an overstatement."
00:00:54.429,00:00:56.973,What a naughty night we had.
00:00:57.057,00:01:00.852,"I drank so much, I can't even remember if I drank anything."
00:01:00.935,00:01:02.020,I might not have.
00:01:02.103,00:01:05.106,You know it's a great night when we're still up to see the plague patrol.
00:01:05.190,00:01:07.233,"Mornin', Princess."
00:01:07.317,00:01:10.153,I just got winked at by a corpse shoveler.
00:01:10.236,00:01:12.822,I don't want this night to ever end.
00:01:12.906,00:01:15.408,"Well, then, madame, I have just the thing."
00:01:18.536,00:01:19.746,Joyride?
00:01:19.829,00:01:24.334,Is that like a jolly trolley or a fun run or a tingle mingle?
00:01:24.417,00:01:27.587,"Oh, he means that we steal it and that it's a bad idea."
00:01:27.670,00:01:29.964,"If my dad found out, he'd kill me."
00:01:30.048,00:01:31.800,"Ooh, boo-hoo."
00:01:31.883,00:01:34.677,Baby doesn't wanna get killed by her daddy.
00:01:34.761,00:01:35.970,I'm a chicken.
00:01:38.056,00:01:41.267,"Hop on, boys. Unless you're chickens."
00:01:46.898,00:01:51.027,"Hey, that's Lady Lingonberry's carriage! I was stealing it!"
00:01:53.196,00:01:55.365,Not on my watch.
00:02:03.081,00:02:06.835,I'm actually a more way careful driver when I'm drunk.
00:02:06.918,00:02:11.673,"I assume that, just 'cause I've never... I've never driven before."
00:02:14.676,00:02:16.553,"Get ready. Next week, we're gonna try arson."
00:02:24.018,00:02:26.312,Suspects headed west on the royal highway.
00:02:40.702,00:02:43.454,"Oh, foo. We're gonna to get arrested."
00:02:43.538,00:02:45.373,You know they prey on the weak in prison?
00:02:52.463,00:02:54.132,Ahh!
00:02:58.219,00:03:00.388,Please do not feed my vehicle.
00:03:07.312,00:03:09.856,Hang on. I've got a bad idea.
00:03:30.293,00:03:32.003,I'm drowning!
00:03:32.086,00:03:33.254,I'm Elfo!
00:03:47.143,00:03:51.773,"Some might say her cries for help were a cry for help, but I think she was just being an attention hog."
00:03:51.856,00:03:54.150,"Oh, no. We're locked out."
00:03:57.570,00:04:02.116,"Okay, the trick to not getting swept over the waterfall is swimming upstream."
00:04:02.200,00:04:04.244,"Got it. Now, what's swimming?"
00:04:11.125,00:04:15.505,"Okay, Elfo. You can do anything if you believe in yourself."
00:04:21.427,00:04:25.515,It was so nice of that swarm of crabs to drag me ashore.
00:04:27.475,00:04:30.937,Anyone want this meat? I only eat it for the shells.
00:04:31.020,00:04:34.274,The perfect end to a night of grand theft carriage.
00:04:34.983,00:04:39.028,Whoa. That looks damn delicious. What the hell is it?
00:04:39.112,00:04:42.991,It's a super-rare fruit the knights brought back from their crusades.
00:04:43.074,00:04:45.118,A lot of people died for it.
00:04:45.201,00:04:47.078,It's like my dad's prized possession.
00:04:47.161,00:04:51.165,Sometimes he just stares at it longingly while he drinks vodka sodas.
00:04:53.751,00:04:55.420,It's what we feed children in Hell.
00:04:55.503,00:04:56.963,"Come on, I dare you to try it."
00:04:59.590,00:05:02.677,Have they no respect for the Lemon Crusades?
00:05:02.760,00:05:07.473,Civilizations were decimated. History rewritten. Maps redrawn.
00:05:07.557,00:05:10.518,"To be fair, sire, you were never going to eat it."
00:05:10.601,00:05:13.354,"Yeah, I heard it was sour. I don't care for sour stuff."
00:05:13.438,00:05:14.522,I care about Bean.
00:05:14.605,00:05:17.442,She's out of control and I've tried everything.
00:05:17.525,00:05:20.069,"Yelling, screaming, everything."
00:05:20.153,00:05:24.866,"Ah, to think all the classy old bats in this family led right to Bean."
00:05:24.949,00:05:28.202,"Carousing, taking her clothes off every chance she gets."
00:05:28.286,00:05:30.788,Doing God knows what with that elf.
00:05:31.914,00:05:34.917,Bean hasn't been the same since she lost her mom.
00:05:35.001,00:05:38.421,"Ah, Dagmar, you were my perfect queen."
00:05:38.504,00:05:41.924,Regal. Kind. Talk all good and stuff.
00:05:42.008,00:05:43.468,Not like Reptilicus.
00:05:43.551,00:05:46.429,Huh. He thinks I am reptile?
00:05:48.806,00:05:51.934,I need some snakeroot to soothe my nerves.
00:06:05.740,00:06:06.866,No more curtains.
00:06:06.949,00:06:10.953,"You know, if you don't sleep for 72 hours, you become clinically insane."
00:06:12.580,00:06:15.750,"Fine, but I'll need a little something to put the edge on."
00:06:27.136,00:06:28.888,I need Oona's Little Helper.
00:06:28.971,00:06:30.681,"Oh, does she have a friend like me?"
00:06:32.183,00:06:34.977,She has nothing in her life except a drug that makes her happy.
00:06:35.061,00:06:36.145,"Now, let's go steal it."
00:06:41.984,00:06:44.695,Stealing from my stepmother's purse.
00:06:46.030,00:06:47.156,It's exactly who you are.
00:06:47.240,00:06:49.158,You're the type to steal enough for your friends.
00:07:00.628,00:07:04.257,I'm kinda scared to try this. Will you guys peer pressure me?
00:07:04.340,00:07:05.633,"Sure thing, buddy."
00:07:07.468,00:07:12.682,Seems our little emissary Luci is successfully corrupting Tiabeanie's mind and soul.
00:07:12.765,00:07:16.686,"Oh, is this the one where the cat and the elf are friends?"
00:07:16.769,00:07:21.107,"Jerry, leave the highballs and, I don't know, feed the peacocks."
00:07:21.190,00:07:23.109,But they don't like me.
00:07:27.530,00:07:30.825,I don't know. I'm not really feeling anything.
00:07:30.908,00:07:32.910,"-Me, either. -Me, either."
00:07:35.580,00:07:36.914,Meither. Meither.
00:07:40.334,00:07:43.129,Meither. What's happening?
00:07:43.754,00:07:46.591,"Wow! My God, you guys. We should start a band."
00:07:50.595,00:07:52.180,Yes! We sound amazing.
00:07:58.519,00:08:00.646,"-Elfo, you're out of the band! -What the hell?"
00:08:00.730,00:08:03.399,We're a duo now. The fans didn't even notice.
00:08:03.483,00:08:05.318,"Luci, you fell off a balcony. Were you pushed?"
00:08:05.401,00:08:06.736,We'll never find out.
00:08:06.819,00:08:09.947,"Dreams come true, 'cause I am a solo act now."
00:08:10.031,00:08:13.117,The fans love my voice. I have dreadlocks.
00:08:13.201,00:08:16.120,But then I shave my head like a true artist.
00:08:16.204,00:08:20.041,"Why is the crowd booing? Oh, no. I'm the talentless one!"
00:08:20.124,00:08:21.459,"Elfo, you came back."
00:08:21.542,00:08:23.544,"Luci, thought I pushed you-- We're together again."
00:08:23.628,00:08:25.671,Let's get out there. We're back on top.
00:08:25.755,00:08:29.050,"Nothing can stop us now. Oh, no. I have cancer. What?"
00:09:14.512,00:09:20.351,Wow. That is the most fun I've ever had without remembering a single moment of it.
00:09:22.353,00:09:25.773,"You'll have to take me, too, 'cause I live here now."
00:09:27.900,00:09:29.318,We've heard about you.
00:09:29.402,00:09:32.154,Word 'round the gutter is you're a right proper villain.
00:09:32.238,00:09:35.408,"'Course, I'm not threatened by that. Women gotta support women."
00:09:35.491,00:09:37.326,"Crime is male-dominated, innit?"
00:09:37.410,00:09:41.497,"If this world were run by women, there wouldn't be so much crime."
00:09:41.581,00:09:44.375,"So our crime, yeah, is one for the ages."
00:09:44.458,00:09:47.753,A real legendary caper. We could use your help.
00:09:47.837,00:09:51.632,"Well, I'll have to confer with my associates first."
00:09:54.260,00:09:56.345,I've never done anything bad before.
00:09:56.429,00:09:58.222,I've never done anything good before.
00:09:58.306,00:10:01.809,I want to be bad. I always admired Bad Elfo.
00:10:01.892,00:10:04.020,Bad Elfo doesn't really exist.
00:10:04.103,00:10:06.272,I would rather hang out with Bad Elfo.
00:10:08.983,00:10:10.026,Yes.
00:10:13.154,00:10:16.324,"Daddy Elfo, um, slapped me on the bum-bum."
00:10:20.328,00:10:22.413,"So, uh, what exactly are we heisting?"
00:10:23.706,00:10:24.832,Potatoes.
00:10:25.916,00:10:28.127,Whoa. Hardcore.
00:10:28.210,00:10:29.503,Hardcore is right.
00:10:33.716,00:10:36.427,"So, actual potatoes. Like from a garden."
00:10:36.510,00:10:38.471,"Yeah, that's where they hide 'em."
00:10:38.554,00:10:40.723,Have you considered stealing things of value?
00:10:40.806,00:10:43.351,'Cause Bean here knows where real treasures are buried.
00:10:43.434,00:10:46.145,I know exactly what he's talking about.
00:10:46.228,00:10:47.980,So what exactly are you talking about?
00:10:48.064,00:10:50.941,Trust me. I haven't led you astray in minutes.
00:11:10.544,00:11:14.965,"Okay, I guess I'm gonna do this, unless someone talks me out of it."
00:11:15.049,00:11:18.135,Hoodlums? Bad friend? Ignorant elf?
00:11:18.761,00:11:21.138,There's a lot of sexual tension between us.
00:11:22.264,00:11:23.683,All right. Wish me luck.
00:11:30.106,00:11:31.732,The family crypt.
00:11:31.816,00:11:36.529,So this is where I'll end up one day. Buried. Forgotten. Worm food.
00:11:36.612,00:11:40.408,"Oh, this is a bad time to be coming down off of that high."
00:11:41.075,00:11:43.536,"Oh, my sweet Bee-Baw."
00:11:43.619,00:11:46.831,Remember when you used to sit me on your lap and tell me stories?
00:11:46.914,00:11:50.000,"Well, I'm in a gang now, and I gotta take your crown."
00:11:50.084,00:11:51.669,And your necklace. And didn't you have...
00:11:55.214,00:12:03.597,"Sometimes when you pull off your grandma's jaw, it really makes you stop and wonder. Am I doing the right-- Come on! This is a burglary, not a family reunion."
00:12:05.850,00:12:07.768,"Okay, that's everything!"
00:12:11.355,00:12:15.359,Whoa. Think of how many potatoes we could get with this.
00:12:15.443,00:12:19.363,If I spend any more time with my family they'll start asking why I'm not married.
00:12:19.447,00:12:21.365,So you wanna drop me that rope?
00:12:39.925,00:12:43.804,"Hear ye, hear ye. Royal court is now in session."
00:12:43.888,00:12:48.225,Ah. Let's have a look at this no-good pile of scum.
00:12:48.309,00:12:49.643,Starting at the feet.
00:12:49.727,00:12:51.645,Mud-covered crime boots.
00:12:51.729,00:12:54.273,Legs muscled by years on the run.
00:12:54.356,00:12:57.860,Obviously stolen belt. Nondescript torso.
00:12:57.943,00:13:00.321,Moving up to the face area.
00:13:00.404,00:13:04.366,"Uh, weak chin, buck teeth, and... Whoa!"
00:13:04.950,00:13:06.076,"Hi, Dad."
00:13:06.160,00:13:09.830,What the... You tryin' to tell me my little girl is this guy?
00:13:09.914,00:13:14.668,There is no way you're gonna convince me my daughter is a criminal.
00:13:14.752,00:13:17.671,Presenting victims one through nine.
00:13:18.297,00:13:19.965,God damn it!
00:13:23.302,00:13:29.433,"Look, I know I went a tad wild, but what do you expect from someone who's got no control over her own destiny?"
00:13:29.517,00:13:32.561,"So I turned to booze, drugs and my evil little friend."
00:13:34.730,00:13:37.316,Your weird cat? I'll pulverize him.
00:13:37.399,00:13:40.861,I'll pet him in the wrong direction. I'll put a cucumber beside him.
00:13:40.945,00:13:42.446,That drives them crazy.
00:13:42.530,00:13:49.078,"No, no, no, not him. I meant-- She meant me. I'm so bad. Oh, I'm bad."
00:13:49.161,00:13:52.706,"No, you're not. You're a marshmallow with legs."
00:14:02.633,00:14:04.510,but my mom never lost her head.
00:14:04.593,00:14:05.845,We recovered this.
00:14:08.681,00:14:12.852,Your daughter was caught ransacking the royal tomb.
00:14:12.935,00:14:15.938,You stole stuff from our dead family?
00:14:16.021,00:14:19.608,"Oh, I don't even know what to yell at you. You take it."
00:14:19.692,00:14:26.073,"Why you... I oughta... If I weren't so fat, I'd-- Shut up! She gets the point."
00:14:26.156,00:14:29.743,"Bean, go to your room while we decide what to do with you."
00:14:29.827,00:14:32.997,"And take Elfo, so I know you're not having any fun."
00:14:39.712,00:14:41.380,This has got to stop.
00:14:45.175,00:14:47.136,Yeah. But it's gotta stop.
00:14:47.219,00:14:50.097,"What? Nuh-uh. I'm your demon, baby."
00:14:50.180,00:14:53.475,"We're magically linked, like lollipops and rug fuzz."
00:14:56.186,00:14:58.772,"Listen, just stay away from me for a while, okay?"
00:14:58.856,00:15:00.900,Go ruin someone else's life.
00:15:10.034,00:15:12.119,What the hell's wrong with my daughter?
00:15:12.202,00:15:14.538,She's like a one-man wrecking woman.
00:15:14.622,00:15:17.958,"According to the holy books, your first mistake was educating her."
00:15:18.042,00:15:24.882,The sheer defiance of reason and decorum leads me to believe that Tiabeanie is what they now call a teenager.
00:15:24.965,00:15:29.470,That don't exactly explain why she desecrated sacred remains.
00:15:29.553,00:15:32.389,"Don't worry, Ma. I won't let her get away with it."
00:15:33.223,00:15:42.441,"Oh, we can spout crazy theories all day, but science suggests a more logical explanation: That Bean is possessed by a demon!"
00:15:43.317,00:15:45.027,"Oh, no, they're on to us."
00:15:45.110,00:15:48.030,They'll know exactly what we're up to.
00:15:48.113,00:15:50.115,You don't even know what we're up to.
00:15:50.199,00:15:55.287,"Oh, every day you say you'll tell me and you never do."
00:16:00.668,00:16:04.630,"A real nice place with ponies, or whatever crap you like."
00:16:06.048,00:16:07.800,"Oh, come in. Come in."
00:16:07.883,00:16:10.886,Make yourself comfortable on the dissection table.
00:16:10.970,00:16:13.847,What are you talking about? And why are you here?
00:16:13.931,00:16:16.350,"Having a cookie, making blood."
00:16:16.433,00:16:19.895,"You'll be fine, sweetie. Strap her down."
00:16:19.979,00:16:24.733,"Now, don't worry. The straps are just for my safety as I flush out your demon."
00:16:27.236,00:16:31.031,"Of course! With my scientific training, it was rather obvious."
00:16:33.117,00:16:35.536,"Ah, your talking cat's here to keep you company."
00:16:35.619,00:16:38.372,"Now, let's find that demon."
00:16:39.748,00:16:41.917,"That's it, dear. Cough out your demon."
00:16:42.001,00:16:44.044,Cough it out like a demonic loogie.
00:16:45.838,00:16:50.968,This powerful lodestone will extract the demon using magnetraction.
00:16:51.051,00:16:52.761,Ooh. Ah.
00:16:52.845,00:16:53.762,Ow!
00:16:53.846,00:16:56.765,Hey. Look at us hanging out on the floor together.
00:16:57.850,00:17:02.104,No demon could survive this preposterous degree of jiggling.
00:17:02.187,00:17:04.857,This is not good for my hangover.
00:17:04.940,00:17:09.194,"Oh, yeah, that's it! Crank harder. You've got him on the run now. Whoo!"
00:17:09.278,00:17:14.074,Work those scrawny nerd arms. Jiggle that demon back to Hell. Nice.
00:17:17.453,00:17:20.414,even after the application of all three sciences.
00:17:20.497,00:17:22.624,All three? Even smoke?
00:17:22.708,00:17:30.549,"Indeed. We scholars like to think science has all the answers, but in the end, it's just a bunch of unprovable nonsense."
00:17:30.632,00:17:31.842,So now what?
00:17:31.925,00:17:36.305,I suggest something based more in reality. Religious magic.
00:17:40.184,00:17:42.811,"Let's do it, but don't say it out loud again."
00:17:43.771,00:17:44.897,"Shut up, you."
00:17:44.980,00:17:49.610,"As it happens, sire, I am acquainted with the world's foremost exorcist."
00:17:49.693,00:17:51.028,Big Jo.
00:17:51.111,00:17:53.906,His people are the sworn enemies of demons.
00:17:53.989,00:17:56.992,But I must warn you. He creeps even me out.
00:17:57.076,00:17:59.495,"Ah, no one's too creepy for my daughter."
00:18:24.144,00:18:26.146,I get that a lot.
00:18:31.902,00:18:35.489,"Okay, Big Jo, she's asleep in the bed chamber."
00:18:36.657,00:18:38.242,I'm already in here.
00:18:39.993,00:18:42.996,I sense an evil presence.
00:18:50.045,00:18:53.173,"Oh, no. It's that accursed weirdo."
00:18:53.257,00:18:55.759,We must act before our plan is discovered.
00:18:56.760,00:18:59.471,"Conceal thyself, demon."
00:19:03.559,00:19:05.144,"Fear not, Princess."
00:19:05.227,00:19:07.896,I will soon have the demon out of your body.
00:19:11.525,00:19:15.863,"Oh, wait, uh, just one princess. Me, Princess Tia..."
00:19:15.946,00:19:18.991,"Oh, God, what's my full name? Damn it."
00:19:19.074,00:19:23.453,"I shall soon cast thee out, demon, with these sacred tools."
00:19:24.830,00:19:29.376,Jokes are a sign of fear. A fear that is well justified.
00:19:33.463,00:19:36.675,So cool! I didn't even know that the human body could do this.
00:19:38.969,00:19:40.762,Out! Get out!
00:19:40.846,00:19:42.556,"Be gone, damn you!"
00:19:42.639,00:19:45.142,Ooh! Sounds like some quality exorcism.
00:19:45.225,00:19:47.394,I was talking to you!
00:19:47.477,00:19:53.066,"Nobody talks to me like that, except my daughter and my wife. And now you."
00:20:04.912,00:20:06.830,It burns with boredom!
00:20:08.290,00:20:10.167,Come on. Liven it up a little.
00:20:10.250,00:20:11.460,Leave this body!
00:20:11.543,00:20:17.549,Allow this girl to resume her humble life of obedience and sobriety and chastity.
00:20:19.551,00:20:26.892,"O Lord, our only God, brother of the other God, grant me the power to expel this vile spirit."
00:20:37.444,00:20:42.366,"Exactly. Once the flesh is burned away, the demon is revealed."
00:20:42.449,00:20:45.369,"Flesh burn, demon return."
00:20:48.705,00:20:51.124,"Great, you're gonna make me be the good guy?"
00:20:51.208,00:20:52.417,"Ugh, I hate that."
00:21:03.178,00:21:06.056,"I saved your life. Now, I can go back to ruining it."
00:21:08.350,00:21:11.311,"Ah! You can't do this, man. I want my lawyer."
00:21:11.395,00:21:14.648,"Uh, I'm in here. Don't say anything."
00:21:18.402,00:21:21.154,You have been exorcised.
00:21:21.238,00:21:24.324,Don't forget to take it easy today and drink plenty of water.
00:21:29.705,00:21:31.915,So is Luci really gone?
00:21:31.999,00:21:34.209,"Well, it depends what you mean by gone."
00:21:34.293,00:21:37.546,"If you mean carted away, never to return, then, yes."
00:21:37.629,00:21:39.256,"Well, maybe it was for the best."
00:21:39.339,00:21:42.759,"Life with him was fun, but I probably would have been dead in a few weeks."
00:21:42.843,00:21:47.806,I will miss how he always pointed out my foibles and mocked me ruthlessly.
00:21:47.889,00:21:49.099,But we'll be okay.
00:21:49.182,00:21:52.686,You'll be amazed how much fun I am on my own.
00:21:58.483,00:21:59.359,So?
00:21:59.443,00:22:03.280,"So, we're making a daisy chain, not a dandelion chain."
00:22:03.363,00:22:12.164,Why even bother to call it a daisy chain if you're just gonna-- I'm not really fun.
00:22:15.083,00:22:20.505,"And then the pressure to sustain the lie? Oh, God, it was a nightmare."
00:22:20.589,00:22:22.257,We have to find Luci.
00:22:25.218,00:22:26.261,Dad.
00:22:26.345,00:22:30.182,"Oh, sweetie, I can see the sparkle in your eyes is gone."
00:22:30.265,00:22:31.808,It's such a relief.
00:22:31.892,00:22:35.270,So where does that exorcist keep the demons after he removes them?
00:22:35.354,00:22:37.773,"Keep them? Oh, he doesn't keep them."
00:22:37.856,00:22:41.068,He disposes of them with extreme prejudice.
00:22:47.991,00:22:51.078,I'm sure one day you'll wake up with them trying to smother you.
00:22:52.079,00:22:54.498,"Never mind. Uh, grab a horse. Let's go!"
00:23:00.754,00:23:04.883,"So there I am, possessing the Duchess and she has the nerve to drop dead."
00:23:04.966,00:23:07.260,"And I'm like, Now where am I gonna live? Rude."
00:23:07.344,00:23:10.764,"Ugh. Well, if it isn't Stacianne LeBlott."
00:23:10.847,00:23:13.308,"It's LeBlatt. Yeah, it's French."
00:23:13.392,00:23:17.312,"Like I said on our first date, nothing could be worse than this."
00:23:37.958,00:23:39.584,"What, now you're highwaymen?"
00:23:39.668,00:23:43.380,Highwaypeople. We're a gender neutral kleptocracy.
00:23:43.463,00:23:46.341,And we'll be taking these nice horsies.
00:23:46.425,00:23:48.927,They go well with me neck sparklies.
00:23:49.010,00:23:51.304,"Hey, that's my grandmother's necklace."
00:23:51.388,00:23:53.014,Or your grandfather's.
00:23:53.098,00:23:56.518,This isn't a gender thing. It's Bee-Baw's and I am taking it back.
00:24:08.613,00:24:10.240,I'm normally a nice person.
00:24:10.782,00:24:12.659,But we really need to save our friend.
00:24:35.765,00:24:37.642,"This is, like, so unfair."
00:24:37.726,00:24:41.646,I never got to haunt a house or spook a dog or get married.
00:24:43.231,00:24:45.442,"Oh, please, put me out of my misery."
00:24:45.525,00:24:47.903,Prepare to be put out of your misery.
00:24:59.080,00:25:01.875,I possessed your mother and she loved it!
00:25:07.797,00:25:11.760,You won't be needing him anymore. Your appeal has been denied!
00:25:11.843,00:25:15.388,"Wait, wait, wait. I love you? Big Jo, I love you!"
00:25:17.766,00:25:21.061,Cursed are those who consort with demons.
00:25:35.951,00:25:39.788,"It's all over, Big Jo. I got the bottle and the knife."
00:25:39.871,00:25:42.290,"Well, I got whatever this is."
00:25:44.042,00:25:46.378,Throw me the bottle. I'll throw you the elf.
00:25:49.673,00:25:50.882,"Okay, catch."
00:25:52.759,00:25:55.679,Oh! You haven't defeated me yet.
00:25:56.471,00:25:58.848,"Now, you have!"
00:26:03.979,00:26:06.231,She risked her own life to save the demon.
00:26:06.314,00:26:07.691,Remarkable.
00:26:07.774,00:26:10.610,She's come along faster than we ever dared dream.
00:26:16.741,00:26:19.119,"No, no, no! Just pull out the cork."
00:26:21.413,00:26:23.623,Ta-da. Did ya miss me?
00:26:23.707,00:26:26.918,"Yes, but never fly into my mouth again."
00:26:27.002,00:26:29.379,"Hey, what's that roll-y, wagon-y sound?"
00:00:37.412,00:00:39.914,"Yeah, the princess is almost never here."
00:00:39.998,00:00:42.792,"You know, we could've just made out at the donkey auction."
00:00:42.876,00:00:46.838,"Yeah, but where's the thrill of that? I mean, don't you like it dangerous?"
00:00:46.921,00:00:48.923,Have you ever made out in front of donkeys?
00:00:52.260,00:00:54.971,"Holy crap, you're Princess Tiabeanie!"
00:00:55.055,00:01:01.061,"No, I'm just a normal teenager, high on bread mold, breaking into castles."
00:01:01.144,00:01:02.729,Then why is there a portrait of you?
00:01:05.815,00:01:08.818,"Sorry, Bean. I heard guys that go with you end up dead."
00:01:08.902,00:01:11.905,"Who'd you hear that from? Get out of here, scribe guy."
00:01:11.988,00:01:15.784,"Embarrassed yet unbowed, the scrivener made his egress."
00:01:15.867,00:01:19.829,"But he would continue to listen outside the door, unbeknownst to the princess."
00:01:19.913,00:01:22.207,"Look, uh, maybe I'll see you sometime."
00:01:23.833,00:01:26.711,"Your hands were all rough and sexy, anyway."
00:01:26.795,00:01:30.381,Go! Go use them on yourself or whatever.
00:01:34.052,00:01:36.638,but I can't if they're all so scared of my stupid dad.
00:01:39.516,00:01:45.271,"Eh, easy. Kill Zog, hollow out his corpse and wear it around from time to time, so people think he's still alive."
00:01:51.111,00:01:53.738,"Yeah, just making murder plans with my cat."
00:01:53.822,00:01:56.157,"Oh, that's nice. Good night, honey."
00:01:56.241,00:01:59.786,"Oh, my God, it's always just gonna be me and my cat, isn't it?"
00:02:05.458,00:02:08.169,Our secret society meets tonight?
00:02:08.253,00:02:13.383,"-No, not until the king leaves the castle. -The elf. Speak only in code."
00:02:13.466,00:02:19.305,We won't convene the cookie club until the asswipe leaves the castle.
00:02:19.973,00:02:24.018,I couldn't help but overhear your secret conversation. Mind if I join?
00:02:26.521,00:02:30.316,"Hey, Sorcerio, how's that elf blood comin' along?"
00:02:30.400,00:02:31.818,I'm not getting any younger.
00:02:31.901,00:02:34.070,"Oh, you will soon, my sire."
00:02:34.154,00:02:35.446,"Hi, asswipe."
00:02:36.656,00:02:41.119,"Don't worry, my liege. His lack of blood has put him in a delirious state."
00:02:41.202,00:02:42.829,We'll give him a sedative.
00:02:42.912,00:02:45.582,Hand me ten ccs of brick.
00:02:53.631,00:02:57.010,I love living where I work. I never have to leave.
00:02:57.093,00:03:00.430,And I never have to work. And people have to do what I say.
00:03:00.513,00:03:02.390,More corn. More gravy.
00:03:03.016,00:03:05.685,"Bean, you ever see a guy eat a whole chicken?"
00:03:05.768,00:03:07.312,"Yes, yesterday, you."
00:03:10.356,00:03:13.735,These bones are getting caught in my throat. Fetch me some water.
00:03:14.485,00:03:18.615,"I know I don't hydrate as much as I should, but is this what water's supposed to look like?"
00:03:18.698,00:03:21.075,"It's fresh from the local well, sire."
00:03:23.411,00:03:25.580,I've already summoned the plumber.
00:03:25.663,00:03:29.000,Good. I'd like to tell him I'm disappointed in his work.
00:03:29.083,00:03:31.502,I'm disappointed in your work.
00:03:31.586,00:03:34.005,Thank you! That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me!
00:03:37.592,00:03:40.845,Trying to get me to drink this water like I'm some kinda idiot.
00:03:40.929,00:03:42.639,"What is this, my first rodeo?"
00:03:42.722,00:03:44.515,What's a rodeo? What were we talking about?
00:03:44.599,00:03:45.558,"Man, I'm thirsty."
00:03:50.897,00:03:53.483,"Oh, I'm dying over here."
00:03:55.652,00:03:59.739,"Oh, why did I behead everyone with a medical license?"
00:03:59.822,00:04:03.493,We take Zoggy to a spa where I get waited on hand and foot.
00:04:03.576,00:04:06.913,"Stay as long as you can, even if it takes the whole weekend."
00:04:06.996,00:04:09.624,People rarely recover before Saturday night.
00:04:09.707,00:04:13.920,Okay. But there better not be any funny business while I'm gone.
00:04:14.003,00:04:15.755,"You can count on me, sire."
00:04:20.343,00:04:23.054,Keep your eyes on Bean and her weird friends.
00:04:25.139,00:04:29.352,"Oh, neat. I'm gonna name them Winky, Blinky and Soul-Stealer."
00:04:29.435,00:04:31.521,Please don't name my eyes.
00:04:31.604,00:04:37.902,"Hey, little guy, if I find so much as a misplaced hair when I get back, I'll cut off your arm."
00:04:37.986,00:04:40.405,"Okay, but not my lucky arm."
00:04:40.488,00:04:42.073,Which one's your lucky arm?
00:04:42.865,00:04:44.784,"Okay, fine, both of them."
00:04:46.369,00:04:47.620,Come on. Go.
00:04:50.581,00:04:53.960,Don't let the drawbridge hit your ass on the way out. Ow!
00:04:54.043,00:04:59.590,"The king may be ill, but we mustn't let this grave occurrence weigh down our somber hearts."
00:04:59.674,00:05:03.094,We must carry on and take comfort in prayer...
00:05:05.430,00:05:09.058,"Oh, I've got to keep it together until he's out of the gates, at least."
00:05:24.198,00:05:29.746,"Okay, the one thing I do know is when your parents are out of town, that's when the fun begins."
00:05:29.829,00:05:32.790,"Now, if I was a normal kid, what would I do?"
00:05:32.874,00:05:34.625,"Mmm, throw a party."
00:05:34.709,00:05:39.380,"Man, I have wanted to throw one of those ever since they were invented five years ago."
00:05:39.464,00:05:43.051,Wait. What are you guys doing? Zog said he'd cut off my arms.
00:05:43.134,00:05:46.721,"Sure, he said it. Did he mean it? We'll find out."
00:05:46.804,00:05:49.599,"Come on, man. Parties are where heroes are born."
00:05:49.682,00:05:53.394,"Deals are made, wallets are lost, people hook up."
00:06:03.029,00:06:05.823,"Yes! Okay, do you guys realize what's happening?"
00:06:05.907,00:06:09.452,"For one night, we get to do whatever we want."
00:06:12.455,00:06:14.999,I'm gonna drink milk out of my shoe.
00:06:17.710,00:06:19.587,I already had milk in there.
00:06:29.222,00:06:31.724,"Hey, welcome to the spa. I'm Chazz."
00:06:31.808,00:06:34.811,I'll be doing all your body butters and light touching.
00:06:34.894,00:06:36.437,What are these clamps for?
00:06:36.521,00:06:40.149,To hold you down while I talk to you. Now let me ask you a few questions.
00:06:40.233,00:06:42.693,-Does it hurt when I poke you like this? -Ow!
00:06:42.777,00:06:46.906,"Good, good. Now, how does it feel when I slap your belly like this?"
00:06:46.989,00:06:47.990,Ow!
00:06:48.074,00:06:50.243,"Okay, last question."
00:06:50.326,00:06:54.622,Have you ever been clamped down naked on a slab by a lunatic who doesn't work for the spa?
00:06:54.705,00:06:56.582,What the hell?
00:06:56.666,00:07:00.128,Don't rattle the clamps. It enrages me.
00:07:01.129,00:07:03.131,"Okay, first up, guest list."
00:07:03.214,00:07:06.342,No Dreamland dudes. They're too scared of Zog.
00:07:06.426,00:07:08.177,"Also, they're kinda plague-y and I just..."
00:07:08.261,00:07:11.222,I can't deal with lips falling off when I kiss people right now.
00:07:11.305,00:07:20.731,"Oh. Sounds like Bean may prefer a mysterious stranger Bean, do you prefer Elfo?"
00:07:20.815,00:07:22.817,That's not what I meant.
00:07:22.900,00:07:25.153,But do you? Don't answer unless it's yes.
00:07:25.236,00:07:32.410,"Dude, decide what you want, drink till you have the nerve to go for it, then keep drinking so the inevitable rejection doesn't hurt so bad."
00:07:32.493,00:07:33.327,What do you want?
00:07:33.411,00:07:37.248,I guess I've always wanted to watch the sunrise with a girl I fancy.
00:07:37.331,00:07:40.793,Ugh. Just say Bean. You want to watch the sunrise with Bean.
00:07:40.877,00:07:42.670,"Well, stop saying what I mean."
00:07:46.674,00:07:53.431,"There shall be, tonight at the castle, a wicked rager, open to any in the kingdom who know how to rage wickedly."
00:08:07.320,00:08:10.990,Party tonight. But don't tell anyone.
00:08:23.252,00:08:25.880,You guys have a band? I didn't know you were interesting.
00:08:25.963,00:08:30.551,"Right now we mostly play corn exchanges, but a lot of times, people look up from what they're doing."
00:08:30.635,00:08:33.262,"Wow, maybe someday you guys will play Cornchella."
00:08:37.141,00:08:40.853,or is the kingdom's most eligible bachelor already here?
00:08:40.937,00:08:43.814,I don't know. Has literally anyone other than you arrived?
00:08:43.898,00:08:48.611,"Aw, I think he looks cute, like the mayor of Babyville."
00:08:48.694,00:08:52.573,Why do you always have to compare me to a cute baby? I'm a cute man.
00:08:52.657,00:08:54.408,"Aw, yes, you are."
00:08:59.956,00:09:01.082,That's enough!
00:09:08.172,00:09:09.882,"Wow, lights."
00:09:10.841,00:09:11.717,"Okay, boys."
00:09:11.801,00:09:15.846,"Let's make this night so legendary, they caution children about it."
00:09:15.930,00:09:17.557,Lower the drawbridge!
00:09:24.105,00:09:28.067,"Uh, yeah, lower the giant painting of the countryside."
00:09:52.633,00:09:54.260,"Welcome, Seekers."
00:09:54.343,00:09:58.264,Take your assigned positions and prepare for our sacred ceremony.
00:09:58.347,00:10:01.934,"At the sound of the gong, let the ritual begin."
00:10:09.442,00:10:13.613,"Hey, so, you gonna ask me to dance or what, huh?"
00:10:13.696,00:10:17.408,"Dance? Why, I'd be delighted. I love to dance."
00:10:18.117,00:10:20.745,Whoa! You're King Zog's daughter.
00:10:20.828,00:10:25.291,"It's cool, man. He's out of town, so-- Actually, sorry, I'm late for a crusade."
00:10:26.667,00:10:29.211,I love to dance. Watch this.
00:10:57.531,00:11:00.701,"Did you wanna maybe dance? No, me neither."
00:11:01.786,00:11:03.996,I don't either. I hate dancing.
00:11:06.666,00:11:08.918,"It would... It'd be crazy if we danced right now, right?"
00:11:18.427,00:11:21.430,"It would be so stupid for us to join them, right?"
00:11:28.688,00:11:34.026,would... would you... Would you wanna do that as well?
00:11:42.326,00:11:44.328,"You're missing your chance, dude."
00:11:44.412,00:11:46.997,"Oh, great, now you made me lose count."
00:11:47.081,00:11:48.541,This is your moment.
00:11:51.752,00:11:53.212,"Make your move, stupid!"
00:11:53.295,00:11:59.009,You're right. I'm gonna march up to Bean and say something I'll have figured out by the time I get there.
00:12:09.395,00:12:11.605,"Hey, you can't park on my lawn."
00:12:11.689,00:12:13.774,My flaming arrow says I can.
00:12:13.858,00:12:16.026,You've got a talking flaming arrow?
00:12:16.110,00:12:19.113,"What? No, it's just a regular arrow."
00:12:19.196,00:12:20.322,"Well, I'm sorry."
00:12:20.406,00:12:24.118,Things get confusing in a world with occasional magic and curses.
00:12:24.201,00:12:36.046,"And while I am a fan of such worlds, I just feel some more clearly set out rules He says it's okay to park here."
00:12:41.761,00:12:46.557,"Couple of wallflowers, standing over by the snack table eating chee..."
00:12:46.640,00:12:51.812,What happened to all the cheese? There were over 300 cubes over here.
00:12:54.982,00:12:58.903,"-Um, well, can I be honest with you? -Yeah, of course."
00:12:58.986,00:13:07.912,"When I left Elfwood, I had no idea why, but then, here, tonight, I feel like I finally know why."
00:13:13.709,00:13:14.919,Go ahead. Say it.
00:13:15.711,00:13:18.047,-I'm into big girls. -What?
00:13:18.130,00:13:19.590,Just hear me out.
00:13:19.673,00:13:25.179,"Before I left, I didn't have any idea that my size, my stature, was..."
00:13:25.262,00:13:26.388,What do you call it?
00:13:26.472,00:13:28.307,-Dinky? -What?
00:13:31.268,00:13:36.649,"I guess what I'm trying to get at, and not so eloquently, but..."
00:13:36.732,00:13:40.820,could you ever go out with a guy who's dinky?
00:13:40.903,00:13:55.209,"Well, I have been drinking a lot tonight, so it might just be the grog talking, but, you know, I think maybe I-- Let's burn this place down!"
00:13:56.710,00:13:59.171,With our smooth northern dance style.
00:14:06.220,00:14:09.974,"You still seem tense. Chazz is gonna take it down a notch, okay?"
00:14:10.057,00:14:12.101,Just me and you.
00:14:12.184,00:14:15.104,"Just Chazz and the king, havin' a dialogue."
00:14:15.187,00:14:17.356,"You know, I thought about being a king once."
00:14:17.439,00:14:20.192,Just wasn't born that way. Those are the breaks.
00:14:22.695,00:14:26.699,"Oh, would you listen to me. Woe is Chazz, huh?"
00:14:26.782,00:14:32.204,Woe is gonna be you if you don't-- We all get to share our feelings.
00:14:35.082,00:14:38.127,Whoever holds the stick gets to share their feelings.
00:14:38.210,00:14:43.507,"I'm feelin' furious! I'm gonna-- Bup, bup, bup. Who has the stick?"
00:14:45.718,00:14:48.721,He sure does. And how do you feel about that?
00:14:48.804,00:14:52.057,Ha! Chazzed. Only I can share the feelings.
00:14:54.393,00:15:02.484,"...and even though I knew I was destined for greatness, the flab on my arms said different. Poor Chazz."
00:15:04.570,00:15:06.655,"Oh, no. Party crashers!"
00:15:06.739,00:15:10.242,"Uh, night's over! Tell your parents to pick you up."
00:15:10.326,00:15:12.411,"Hey, chill out. This is Bean's party."
00:15:12.494,00:15:16.206,Whoo! Horse at a party! Party horse rules!
00:15:16.290,00:15:19.877,"Hey, nice. She drank her way out of depression like a pro."
00:15:19.960,00:15:21.879,Stupid lucky horse.
00:15:30.220,00:15:33.307,"The horse has big, beautiful teeth. Like you."
00:15:33.390,00:15:36.268,"-Your tooth is beautiful, too. -Ah."
00:15:41.523,00:15:43.984,"Um, please don't sit in the king's chair."
00:15:44.068,00:15:46.654,It's for his royal ass only. Thank you.
00:15:46.737,00:15:49.698,Ha! Kings! I fear no kings.
00:15:49.782,00:15:53.953,"Queens either. Dukes kinda give me the willies, but kings? Bah!"
00:15:54.536,00:15:58.415,Hi. You seem unafraid of kings and probably have other qualities.
00:16:01.627,00:16:03.420,because inside there is pain.
00:16:03.504,00:16:04.838,Welcome to my party.
00:16:04.922,00:16:09.343,"So this is your castle? You're not like some stuck up princess, are you?"
00:16:09.426,00:16:13.472,Did I say my party? I meant thy party.
00:16:13.555,00:16:15.307,I'm all about possessive pronouns.
00:16:15.391,00:16:18.143,"They be the latest thing, does not thee know?"
00:16:18.227,00:16:21.188,"Where I come from, we don't possess our pronouns."
00:16:21.271,00:16:24.483,"We let them run free, like the majestic snow chimp."
00:16:26.610,00:16:28.112,Can I show you around?
00:16:30.823,00:16:34.326,Odval and Sorcerio will put an end to all this naughtiness.
00:16:42.001,00:16:48.257,"Elfo, you mustn't be here. This is an ancient secret society that conducts great matters of state and diplomacy."
00:16:48.340,00:16:54.346,"We are the shadow behind the crown, the prime movers of history, the unseen hand."
00:16:55.556,00:16:58.142,It looks like people are just having sex.
00:16:58.225,00:17:02.021,"Oh, yes, we do that, too. Diplomacy is complicated."
00:17:02.104,00:17:06.734,"I don't want to interrupt whatever those four people are doing, but could you come throw a wet blanket..."
00:17:06.817,00:17:09.111,"not that wet blanket, on the party upstairs?"
00:17:09.194,00:17:11.989,I'm sorry. I'm sort of in the middle of someone right now.
00:17:12.072,00:17:14.283,Come back later with an open mind.
00:17:14.366,00:17:17.119,"And your sassy friend, the talking cat."
00:17:24.501,00:17:27.921,"Wait. You're not a princess, but you have a room in this castle?"
00:17:28.005,00:17:32.968,"What? No. This isn't my room. This is, uh, her room."
00:17:33.052,00:17:36.096,Meet Princess Tiabunty.
00:17:37.097,00:17:39.808,"Oh, uh, I'm a princess, I is."
00:17:39.892,00:17:43.562,"Um, this is me bed that me family lives on and..."
00:17:58.911,00:18:03.165,"Ugh, great, everyone up here is doing diplomacy, too."
00:18:09.630,00:18:11.799,"Ugh, you're still up?"
00:18:11.882,00:18:14.968,"Uh, where's Bean? I thought you were supposed to be chaperoning her."
00:18:15.052,00:18:17.221,What? What's wrong with you? Why would you think that?
00:18:17.304,00:18:19.306,What? She's unchaperoned?
00:18:19.932,00:18:23.519,"Oh, hi, Bean. I'm not interrupting, am I?"
00:18:24.770,00:18:26.188,Mind if I sit on the bed?
00:18:26.271,00:18:27.564,What are you doing?
00:18:27.648,00:18:29.566,You allow your chimp on the bed?
00:18:29.650,00:18:31.860,"Elf, actually. Common mistake."
00:18:31.944,00:18:33.362,Can you pass me a pillow?
00:18:33.445,00:18:36.031,My back hurts when my body's filled with rage.
00:18:36.115,00:18:40.285,"Oh, it's not healthy to store that. Would you like to lie down?"
00:18:40.369,00:18:42.246,"Elfo, get out of my room."
00:18:42.329,00:18:45.415,This is your room? You are the princess?
00:18:45.499,00:18:47.251,"Elfo, I'm gonna kill you."
00:18:47.334,00:18:48.961,"Um, you can't kill me."
00:18:49.044,00:18:52.506,Her dad needs me for the Elixir of Life. It's kind of like insurance.
00:18:52.589,00:18:54.133,The Elixir of Life?
00:18:54.216,00:18:57.427,Your snowy hair and stormy breath remind me of my homeland.
00:18:57.511,00:19:00.889,"You've been a comfort, but my priorities have changed."
00:19:00.973,00:19:02.516,"Sven, wait."
00:19:02.599,00:19:04.726,"What is your problem, man?"
00:19:04.810,00:19:09.898,"This weekend was my one chance at freedom and you ruined it, just like my dad."
00:19:09.982,00:19:12.317,"You are just a little, green Zog."
00:19:12.401,00:19:15.779,"No, wait! I was just trying to control you."
00:19:15.863,00:19:16.989,Oh.
00:19:20.242,00:19:22.202,"Well, at least he... Oh."
00:19:22.703,00:19:24.580,Uh... Oh.
00:19:28.208,00:19:30.085,I'm sorry. I was too aggressive.
00:19:30.169,00:19:33.630,"I'll go back to being passive aggressive, 'cause it worked so well."
00:19:33.714,00:19:36.717,Too late. Tonight's turned into a carriage wreck.
00:19:36.800,00:19:39.970,I just want to send people home and curl up with my favorite book.
00:19:40.053,00:19:42.097,The hollowed-out one with the booze inside?
00:19:42.181,00:19:43.432,Yeah. I can't put it down.
00:19:44.016,00:19:48.103,"Party's over. Everyone out. Come on, guys. Look alive."
00:19:51.773,00:19:53.442,Seize them.
00:20:20.636,00:20:24.806,I claim this castle in the name of Land Vikings!
00:20:29.937,00:20:32.898,This is why you gotta make people RSVP.
00:20:35.067,00:20:39.821,I wouldn't say I was locked up in a lunatic asylum because I was crazy.
00:20:44.493,00:21:06.431,"But, hey, I escaped and ended up here, Congratulations, Your Highness."
00:21:06.515,00:21:09.184,"Not thinking about your tummy troubles now, are you?"
00:21:09.268,00:21:12.646,You tortured me for 24 straight hours.
00:21:12.729,00:21:14.022,That's what cures it.
00:21:14.106,00:21:17.150,"Well, that or the passage of time. We're not really sure."
00:21:17.234,00:21:19.611,I've had it with you and your successful methods.
00:21:19.695,00:21:22.030,I'm gettin' out while I still have my dignity.
00:21:27.160,00:21:30.580,I don't get why you'd want to take over this shoddy kingdom anyway.
00:21:30.664,00:21:35.585,We're broke. This castle's not even made of real stone. It's particle stone.
00:21:36.461,00:21:38.672,Vikings don't care about riches.
00:21:38.755,00:21:43.051,"We want immortality, that our names might live on for a hundred years."
00:21:43.135,00:21:45.012,We must have the Elixir of Life.
00:21:45.095,00:21:49.266,"Hear ye, hear ye! The return of King Zog is imminent."
00:21:49.349,00:21:52.936,Please do not shoot the messenger any more.
00:21:54.771,00:21:59.234,"Oh, God, my dad's gonna kill us, and then the Vikings are gonna kill my dad."
00:21:59.318,00:22:01.820,"Hey, at least Elfo's sad. Look at his lip quiver."
00:22:08.201,00:22:11.204,I'm joining forces with our savage conqueror.
00:22:11.288,00:22:12.122,What?
00:22:14.499,00:22:15.834,Your Majesty.
00:22:15.917,00:22:18.128,"Ah, now we're talking."
00:22:18.211,00:22:21.757,We shall rule together as tyrant and tyrantina.
00:22:24.051,00:22:27.554,"If this is what you want, Bean, I won't stand in your way."
00:22:27.637,00:22:30.307,I wish you all the gumdrops in the rainbow.
00:22:30.390,00:22:42.152,"Thanks, Elfo. And when those gumdrops get stuck in our throats, as they inevitably will, we shall wash them down with the Elixir of Life, which we totally have."
00:22:50.577,00:22:52.913,This shoddy kingdom is ours forever.
00:22:52.996,00:22:57.459,"Eternity shall remember the names of Sven and, uh..."
00:22:57.542,00:22:59.586,-Bean. -Really?
00:22:59.669,00:23:03.048,"Behold, guys, the Elixir of Life."
00:23:16.019,00:23:19.189,-A little bug never hurt anyone. -What about that squirrel?
00:23:19.689,00:23:21.775,"Oh, that's my pet Bloaty."
00:23:21.858,00:23:27.906,Wait a minute. You named your pet squirrel Bloaty before he died and got all bloated?
00:23:27.989,00:23:32.119,"And your name is Sven and you're a Viking, so we're all a little obvious here, aren't we?"
00:23:32.202,00:23:33.453,"Come on, drink up."
00:23:35.580,00:23:41.211,Hold on. I didn't become regional manager of the Land Vikings by drinking any old liquid.
00:23:41.294,00:23:43.088,How do I know this is not a trick?
00:23:43.171,00:23:45.006,'Cause I told you?
00:23:46.007,00:23:48.009,Showed you. I have to show you.
00:23:56.101,00:23:59.479,"Well, here's to seeing the sun rise another day."
00:24:04.025,00:24:06.111,See? It's totally fine.
00:24:06.194,00:24:08.947,Are you turning green? Or were you already green?
00:24:18.498,00:24:21.251,Huh. I wasn't expecting to chew.
00:24:23.378,00:24:25.672,"Right this way, gentlemen."
00:24:26.631,00:24:28.550,"Luci, pull the lever."
00:24:34.806,00:24:40.020,"Bean! Bean! Grab my hand! As your future husband, I command it."
00:24:40.103,00:24:43.023,"Oh, you shouldn't have said that. Here's a hammer."
00:24:44.691,00:24:50.947,"Look at you. You're just a coward like every other guy except that one over there, with his head in a bucket."
00:24:58.121,00:25:02.042,Wow! I can't believe you just sent so many people to their death.
00:25:02.125,00:25:05.086,"Death? No, they'll just all fall into the ocean."
00:25:06.671,00:25:09.257,Oh. I guess it was low tide.
00:25:09.341,00:25:14.888,"Hey, Elfo, I just want to say that what you did really means a lot to me."
00:25:14.971,00:25:16.515,I won't forget it.
00:25:17.224,00:25:18.350,Can you hear me?
00:25:19.726,00:25:20.977,"Hey, can you hear me?"
00:25:21.061,00:25:24.481,"Can you maybe save this for later, when I can appreciate it?"
00:25:24.564,00:25:28.276,"And they looked into each other's eyes, and the question arose."
00:25:28.360,00:25:31.488,Will they or won't they...
00:25:31.571,00:25:34.991,notice that King Zog's carriage has arrived in the courtyard right now?
00:25:41.706,00:25:43.917,"Oh, God, I've never cleaned before."
00:25:44.000,00:25:48.505,You don't have to tell me what happened up here if I don't have to tell you what happened down there.
00:25:48.588,00:25:50.423,Deal. Just help me clean.
00:25:50.507,00:25:54.427,"Elfo, you scrub the blood off the walls, and I'll sweep up the crushed pretzels."
00:26:00.475,00:26:02.894,Stuff it up the chimney with these torsos.
00:26:08.775,00:26:11.987,Portcullis properly lowered to defensive position.
00:26:12.070,00:26:14.990,Walking up stairs now. Landing neat and tidy.
00:26:15.073,00:26:18.326,"Second set of stairs, also fine."
00:26:18.410,00:26:22.664,"Now approaching the throne room, not expecting any surprises."
00:26:22.747,00:26:26.418,Blood pressure steady as I enter and...
00:26:27.544,00:26:31.673,Oh. It's totally clean and there are people here to greet me.
00:26:31.756,00:26:33.174,How nice.
00:26:33.258,00:26:37.137,"Welcome back to your castle, Father, where nothing unusual occurred."
00:26:37.220,00:26:40.390,Certainly no religious sex magic rituals.
00:26:40.473,00:26:41.683,Glad to hear it.
00:26:41.766,00:26:49.941,"Now I would like to sit on my throne and rule my kingdom, which most certainly was not overthrown by barbarians."
00:26:50.025,00:26:51.776,"Dad, why are you talking like that?"
00:26:51.860,00:26:53.945,"Sorry, I had a stroke on the way home."
00:27:02.203,00:27:06.833,"Hey, at least you get to watch the sunrise with a girl. Sorry it's just me."
00:27:06.916,00:27:09.753,"Well, maybe someday you'll get your wish, too."
00:27:10.462,00:27:11.755,"I have wishes, too."
00:27:11.838,00:27:14.966,But you wouldn't know that because you never asked. Rude.
00:27:15.050,00:27:17.302,I also had a dream where all my teeth fell out.
00:27:19.387,00:27:20.388,"Man, dreams."
00:27:20.472,00:27:23.808,Maybe reality is the dream and dreams are reality.
00:27:23.892,00:27:25.185,You ever think about that?
00:27:32.525,00:27:35.820,"You know, I think a fire would be nice, yeah."
00:27:35.904,00:27:40.325,"Okay. Picking up the poker. Opening the flue, and..."
00:27:42.452,00:27:47.415,Bean!
00:00:37.787,00:00:40.582,"Welcome to your new home, Princess."
00:00:40.665,00:00:42.917,You're late. Put these on.
00:00:44.127,00:00:46.546,Morning miseries begin at 5:00 a.m.
00:00:47.464,00:00:49.132,Wow. I thought Hell was bad.
00:00:58.767,00:01:00.977,"Oh, man, I'm late for morning prayers!"
00:01:01.061,00:01:02.687,"Come on, hurry up. Hide!"
00:01:02.771,00:01:04.773,"Relax, they'll never know I'm here."
00:01:18.787,00:01:22.165,"Sister Tiabeanie, you're late again!"
00:01:22.248,00:01:23.416,"Sorry, Mother Superior."
00:01:23.500,00:01:27.670,I didn't get a lot of sleep on account of my bed being a granite slab.
00:01:27.754,00:01:30.799,Granite? Why does she get the good slab?
00:01:30.882,00:01:33.009,Princesses always get the best slabs.
00:01:33.093,00:01:35.637,"Guys, I did not ask for this. Come on."
00:01:35.720,00:01:38.640,You throw one little party and Vikings take over the kingdom.
00:01:38.723,00:01:39.933,Who hasn't been there?
00:01:43.853,00:01:47.440,"Sisters, do not be distracted by this heathen."
00:01:47.524,00:01:48.650,It's mealtime.
00:01:48.733,00:01:53.238,"Our soup of the day is hot dog water, and for that, let us rejoice."
00:02:07.335,00:02:09.379,"Man, I'm gonna be humming that all day."
00:02:21.432,00:02:23.309,"Oh, my..."
00:02:23.393,00:02:26.688,Who is angering God with their unholy slurping?
00:02:26.771,00:02:28.940,You're doing great. Slurp harder!
00:02:32.110,00:02:34.028,What? It's good.
00:02:37.031,00:02:39.325,"Sorry, I've lost track."
00:02:39.409,00:02:42.245,"-What are we praying for now? -Oh, for..."
00:02:42.328,00:02:48.543,"We are praying, Sister Tiabeanie, that God might see fit to help the poor."
00:02:48.626,00:02:52.922,"If you want to help them, why not just melt this God guy down and pass him out like coins?"
00:03:00.471,00:03:01.764,Return to your slab!
00:03:01.848,00:03:04.100,"Okay, sorry, sorry."
00:03:04.184,00:03:06.060,I don't know what's gotten into her.
00:03:20.241,00:03:22.660,"You know, I would have left willingly!"
00:03:27.498,00:03:28.708,"Oh, hello, Bean."
00:03:28.791,00:03:34.088,I've had Sorcerio work up a special effect so smoke comes out my ears when I yell.
00:03:34.172,00:03:38.384,"Putting in the pellets, pouring in the vinegar."
00:03:38.468,00:03:40.637,Thinking about what I'm gonna say and...
00:03:44.015,00:03:46.142,"Daddy, please, I've learned my lesson."
00:03:46.226,00:03:49.729,I'll never throw a giant awesome party while you're away again.
00:03:49.812,00:03:51.189,Aw! Really?
00:03:51.981,00:03:54.317,And I promise to never have another drink.
00:03:54.400,00:03:55.735,You're drinking right now.
00:03:59.572,00:04:01.824,Sorry. I'm done threatening you.
00:04:01.908,00:04:05.078,You screwed up as a princess. You screwed up as a nun.
00:04:05.161,00:04:07.288,Those are the only two girl things I know.
00:04:07.372,00:04:10.959,"You're a screwup, too. What about that tax on yelling that you had?"
00:04:11.042,00:04:12.877,It came back to haunt me!
00:04:16.422,00:04:20.718,"-This ain't about my impulse control. -Or lack thereof, tubby."
00:04:22.720,00:04:25.640,"You're a pampered, irresponsible layabout!"
00:04:35.191,00:04:37.986,You're a good-for-nothing and you're good at nothing.
00:04:38.069,00:04:42.740,And you ain't coming back 'til you appreciate all the money I poured into yelling at you.
00:04:42.824,00:04:48.121,Fine. I can make it on my own. I don't need you. I don't need anyone.
00:04:48.204,00:04:49.539,"Come on, guys."
00:04:51.874,00:04:53.543,Now it goes off?
00:04:55.878,00:04:58.339,"Man, I can't believe Dad kicked us out."
00:04:58.423,00:05:01.884,"I can't believe he called you a worthless, bucktoothed degenerate."
00:05:01.968,00:05:04.387,-He didn't say that. -Doesn't make it any less true.
00:05:04.470,00:05:07.682,Who cares what he thinks? I don't need my dad's approval.
00:05:07.765,00:05:10.268,Spoken like a true homeless teenager.
00:05:11.269,00:05:13.062,"I used to be a princess, too."
00:05:13.146,00:05:14.856,What does Zog know anyway?
00:05:14.939,00:05:18.526,I'm probably good at so many things I just haven't tried yet.
00:05:18.609,00:05:22.113,"You know what? This isn't so bad. No, no, no. This is actually good."
00:05:22.196,00:05:25.283,This is an opportunity to start fresh.
00:05:26.200,00:05:30.204,"I told you strumpets to stay off me block. Oh, Your Highness."
00:05:31.456,00:05:34.125,Bunty? Why are you throwing trash out your window?
00:05:34.208,00:05:36.794,This isn't a window. This is our trash hole.
00:05:36.878,00:05:38.838,We're far too poor for windows.
00:05:38.921,00:05:41.799,We only just got a door when the horse ate the wall.
00:05:41.883,00:05:45.553,"Didn't agree with him, though. Step around and come in."
00:05:51.351,00:05:54.020,"Children, this is Princess Tiabeanie."
00:05:54.103,00:05:57.398,She's going to be staying with us until she realizes how good she has it.
00:05:57.482,00:05:58.941,-Hello. -Hello.
00:05:59.025,00:06:01.110,"No, I couldn't impose, Bunty."
00:06:01.194,00:06:04.155,It'd be taking precious food out of the mouths of your kids.
00:06:04.238,00:06:06.783,Rubbish. We never turn away a hungry soul.
00:06:06.866,00:06:11.245,"We've got this pot of stew here, and we can always add another cat. Mmm."
00:06:14.123,00:06:15.500,"Wait, what are you doing?"
00:06:15.583,00:06:17.752,Pig milk for the runty ones.
00:06:22.173,00:06:23.841,"You sure we can stay, Bunts?"
00:06:23.925,00:06:27.678,No worries. There's plenty of room since Allison went to a better place.
00:06:27.762,00:06:29.972,"-Oh. -No, she went to Twinkletown."
00:06:30.056,00:06:33.017,-Ah. -Where she was ripped apart by street dogs.
00:06:33.101,00:06:34.644,-Oh. -They were puppies.
00:06:34.727,00:06:35.770,Aw.
00:06:35.853,00:06:39.399,"Shame, though. She were only nine years old, just a year from retirement."
00:06:39.482,00:06:41.859,-She had a job? -They all got jobs.
00:06:41.943,00:06:44.904,I'm a midwife. Excuse me for a moment.
00:06:45.446,00:06:46.280,Oh!
00:06:48.282,00:06:50.910,"Uh-uh. If you can cry, you can work."
00:06:53.454,00:06:57.750,"Oh, my God, jobs. That's what people do all day!"
00:07:01.963,00:07:03.631,What's minimum wage around here?
00:07:03.714,00:07:05.049,Two lashings an hour.
00:07:05.133,00:07:07.468,"Gotta start somewhere. Elfo, you coming?"
00:07:09.971,00:07:11.848,"More pow-pow on the bum-bum, please."
00:07:14.267,00:07:16.811,this job is easier than it looks.
00:07:16.894,00:07:20.064,"Okay, guys, listen up. I'm gonna try out my sheep call on you."
00:07:22.442,00:07:23.443,"No, wait, come back!"
00:07:28.573,00:07:30.908,"Well, at least you kept them together."
00:07:30.992,00:07:33.744,"Every time I turn my head away, something bad happens."
00:07:47.884,00:07:51.471,This isn't working out. Maybe I really am a good-at-nothing.
00:07:51.554,00:07:52.638,Good-for-nothing.
00:08:04.734,00:08:06.986,"Ooh, I would not kiss me right now."
00:08:07.069,00:08:08.237,I wouldn't worry about that.
00:08:08.321,00:08:10.072,I'll never find a place to fit in.
00:08:10.156,00:08:14.076,I'm just gonna crawl back to my dad 'cause I'm a loser who can't keep a job.
00:08:14.160,00:08:17.163,"Hey, if you're gonna crawl back, can I ride you like a horse?"
00:08:17.246,00:08:18.080,All right.
00:08:22.168,00:08:28.424,"My apprentice has gone missing under mysterious circumstances, but instead of looking for him, I could just hire you."
00:08:28.508,00:08:29.675,It's a real time-saver.
00:08:29.759,00:08:32.470,"I don't know, Stan. I'm not really good at anything."
00:08:32.553,00:08:35.097,Do you like short conversations with interesting people?
00:08:35.181,00:08:36.015,I guess.
00:08:36.098,00:08:38.476,Great. I hope you don't mind wearing a uniform.
00:08:42.396,00:08:43.981,That's an executioner joke.
00:08:44.065,00:08:49.195,"You'll hear all of them in the first 15 minutes, then it's basically just human tragedy."
00:08:52.657,00:08:54.659,I always wanted to be in the entertainment industry.
00:08:54.742,00:08:57.537,"You know, in Hell, I was a communications major."
00:09:03.626,00:09:05.878,This is the thumb screw. Whoa-ho!
00:09:05.962,00:09:07.672,This is the rack. Whoa!
00:09:07.755,00:09:12.009,"And this is the iron maiden, and this is the book of golf jokes."
00:09:13.719,00:09:18.140,My wife says I play too much golf so I decided to make a change. I got a new wife.
00:09:19.976,00:09:24.313,"After seeing my golf score, my caddy gave me one great piece of advice. Take up tennis."
00:09:24.397,00:09:26.482,No! I beg you!
00:09:26.566,00:09:29.277,"Since this is your first day, we'll keep it simple."
00:09:29.360,00:09:31.988,Torture this guy a little then get him his last meal.
00:09:32.572,00:09:35.741,"Oof. Um, this looks... Yikes."
00:09:35.825,00:09:40.454,"You know, I'm hungry. Are you hungry? Let's do the meal part first."
00:09:40.538,00:09:42.832,-I could eat. -Great. What are we having?
00:09:42.915,00:09:44.792,It's your last meal. Choice is yours.
00:09:44.875,00:09:46.711,"Ooh. Uh, stew."
00:09:46.794,00:09:49.547,"Hmm. No, I had stew yesterday."
00:09:49.630,00:09:53.384,"-Okay, uh, chicken. -Fried or roasted?"
00:09:53.467,00:09:55.511,I was thinking roasted.
00:09:55.595,00:09:57.555,Um...
00:10:01.392,00:10:05.396,"-Well, what do you want? -Oh, I don't care. It's your last meal."
00:10:05.479,00:10:09.817,"Fine, fine. Steak. I want steak for my last meal. Okay?"
00:10:12.194,00:10:15.489,"Actually, I'm sorry. That's just so heavy, you know?"
00:10:16.157,00:10:18.159,You know what? Maybe stew. Stew?
00:10:21.746,00:10:24.332,-Wow. You're a natural. -Really?
00:10:24.415,00:10:27.168,"-Oh, yeah. -Don't leave me alone with her!"
00:10:27.251,00:10:28.669,I guess I am.
00:10:41.140,00:10:46.729,"I've captured the witch who abducted those people in the woods, way back to the Hansel and Gretel cold case."
00:10:46.812,00:10:49.440,Good work bringing her in alive and unharmed.
00:10:49.523,00:10:51.901,We'll chop her head off this afternoon.
00:10:59.116,00:11:03.537,"Everybody have fun at work today. Alfred, don't suck on your pickax."
00:11:03.621,00:11:05.581,Mining makes me nervous.
00:11:10.336,00:11:14.382,So I'm thinking a little light powdering and then maybe nap time?
00:11:14.465,00:11:17.051,"Oh, I've got something special for you."
00:11:17.134,00:11:20.638,"You do? Aw, that's so nice... What the hell?"
00:11:31.357,00:11:33.776,It was okay when I was taking things a little too far.
00:11:33.859,00:11:37.530,"Aw, baby's cranky. Baby does need a nap."
00:11:40.032,00:11:43.202,This is no kinda place for a grown-ass elf.
00:11:53.879,00:11:57.007,"Okay, or you're just a crazy old witch."
00:11:57.091,00:11:59.593,But maybe that isn't what you wanted to be.
00:11:59.677,00:12:04.390,"Plus, there can't be that many opportunities for older women who like to cackle. Is that it?"
00:12:10.938,00:12:11.981,Maybe both.
00:12:16.318,00:12:19.238,"Oh, nothing a few days on the rack won't cure."
00:12:24.702,00:12:27.496,Guess I won't be chopping off any heads today.
00:12:27.580,00:12:29.290,Looks like you got a reprieve.
00:12:36.422,00:12:39.592,"Oh, wee one, there's no escape from the fun cage."
00:12:44.930,00:12:47.808,I'm not a baby. I'm a toddler.
00:12:53.355,00:12:56.400,Blood ponchos! Get your blood ponchos!
00:12:56.484,00:12:59.570,Can't stand in the splash zone without a blood poncho!
00:12:59.653,00:13:03.574,This is all happening so quick. I'm really nervous. What do I do?
00:13:03.657,00:13:06.786,"For starters, you should have put on the black hood before coming out."
00:13:06.869,00:13:08.245,Now everyone knows who you are.
00:13:13.292,00:13:16.128,I'm not sure I can do this. I've never killed anyone before.
00:13:19.423,00:13:21.675,Or bother me. Or marry me.
00:13:21.759,00:13:24.553,"Bean, you're a natural. And I've seen you torture."
00:13:24.637,00:13:28.015,"Just think of this as torture, but with a big, splattery finish."
00:13:28.098,00:13:30.976,Now get out there and let's see some gore.
00:13:31.644,00:13:35.606,"I'll be right here with you, okay? If you get nervous, just look into my eye."
00:13:40.861,00:13:44.406,My little girl. All grown up and choppin' heads.
00:13:44.490,00:13:47.201,And all it took was some loving banishment.
00:13:59.755,00:14:02.883,"Remember, run between the trees!"
00:14:13.853,00:14:16.939,Let's hear it for Gary the Grabass.
00:14:22.236,00:14:24.196,"And now, the main event."
00:14:24.280,00:14:31.829,Please put your hands together in prayer for the people-snatching witch!
00:14:43.382,00:14:47.553,"This is a goddamn solemn occasion, so shut the hell up, all right?"
00:14:49.054,00:14:52.141,"You guys, have some compassion and respect here."
00:14:52.224,00:14:56.604,"This poor woman is nervous. She's shaking, she's sweating."
00:14:57.229,00:14:59.607,This is the first time she's ever been killed.
00:14:59.690,00:15:00.983,"Give her a break, okay?"
00:15:01.066,00:15:03.360,She's talking about herself.
00:15:03.944,00:15:07.531,"I'm sorry, I guess I have to chop your head off now."
00:15:07.615,00:15:08.991,Do you have any last words?
00:15:09.074,00:15:11.869,You could apologize. Maybe then the king would pardon you.
00:15:14.622,00:15:16.498,"Come on, this is it."
00:15:16.582,00:15:19.084,At least give us something to remember you by.
00:15:19.168,00:15:23.672,As long as it's not-- What is wrong with you?
00:15:23.756,00:15:25.799,It's like you want me to chop your head off.
00:15:25.883,00:15:27.551,Help a sister out.
00:15:31.305,00:15:33.974,"Stay sharp, son. It might go foul."
00:15:41.690,00:15:46.278,"You can do it, Bean. Just use the force. Centrifugal force."
00:15:46.362,00:15:49.615,"Hey, choppa, choppa. Swing, choppa."
00:15:49.698,00:15:53.369,"That's my little girl, everyone. Murdering that hag."
00:16:11.345,00:16:14.306,"I'm watching the same execution as you, son. I don't know."
00:16:19.770,00:16:20.771,I can't.
00:16:22.731,00:16:25.484,This is the worst field trip ever.
00:16:25.567,00:16:29.363,"I misspoke, Bean. You know how I said you were a failure and a quitter?"
00:16:29.446,00:16:32.533,I forgot one more thing. You're also a loser.
00:16:32.616,00:16:34.076,Make way for the loser.
00:16:34.159,00:16:36.704,Coming through. Here she is.
00:16:36.787,00:16:40.249,Failure slash quitter slash loser. The triple-threat.
00:16:54.096,00:16:57.933,"Well, that's it, I guess. There's no place for me in Dreamland."
00:16:59.977,00:17:03.188,Move along! You're bad for business.
00:17:03.272,00:17:07.151,Maybe I'm just not cut out for the high-pressure lifestyle of the big city.
00:17:07.234,00:17:12.531,"It's not for everybody. Me-flavored water, 15 cents."
00:17:12.614,00:17:16.285,"Come taste my knees, 15 cents."
00:17:28.047,00:17:31.550,I ain't no rock and I've heard better crying.
00:17:39.391,00:17:41.477,-Where do you think he was going? -Who?
00:17:41.560,00:17:44.938,"Well, we can add detective to the list of things you're bad at."
00:17:45.022,00:17:46.190,There's only one elf in town.
00:17:46.273,00:17:50.569,Oh! Elfo! His tracks lead right toward that tree.
00:17:52.196,00:17:56.200,"It looks like he turned away at the last second, then hit this other tree."
00:17:56.283,00:18:06.043,"Then he cried, kicked that rock, hopped around in pain, then stomped angrily down this trail, where this demented squirrel stole his shoe."
00:18:25.896,00:18:28.273,Hi. Elfo. And you are?
00:18:28.357,00:18:30.692,Amused by your wittle twousers.
00:18:30.776,00:18:35.155,"If you're referring to my nappy, it's actually war pants."
00:18:35.239,00:18:37.825,"Well, I should probably get back to battle."
00:18:43.122,00:18:44.123,Ah!
00:18:46.166,00:18:47.751,Mmm. Mmm.
00:18:50.796,00:18:52.798,Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
00:18:56.760,00:19:01.849,"Come, the candy inside tastes much better. Less bird droppings."
00:19:01.932,00:19:04.601,-He's Hansel. -Und she's Gretel.
00:19:04.685,00:19:06.436,So Gretel and Hansel?
00:19:17.531,00:19:19.700,"Mmm, wow. Good cocoa."
00:19:19.783,00:19:22.327,"Yeah, buttery mouthfeel, good viscosity."
00:19:22.411,00:19:25.956,Do I detect some kind of mallow? I wanna say marsh.
00:19:26.039,00:19:28.709,"Oh, you must have excellent taste."
00:19:31.587,00:19:35.340,"Don't give away the game. When Germans laugh, people get nervous."
00:19:35.424,00:19:37.759,Can I do the thing about having him for dinner?
00:19:37.843,00:19:40.053,That's fine. He's a dummkopf. It doesn't matter.
00:19:40.137,00:19:41.471,Let's fatten him up!
00:19:41.555,00:19:44.474,"He's looking at us, so I'm going to stop whispering now."
00:19:45.017,00:19:48.145,You say you come from the land of candy?
00:19:53.525,00:19:56.862,Und none of them are dusted mit sleeping powder.
00:19:58.113,00:20:02.409,"I'll tell you, if I lived here, I'd probably eat the whole place."
00:20:04.870,00:20:07.206,"Oh, we're more meat eaters now."
00:20:11.210,00:20:16.924,Oh! All that candy made me so tired. I'm just gonna lay down in this pan.
00:20:17.007,00:20:21.094,He might as well just pour butter on himself. He is!
00:20:21.178,00:20:23.597,I'm confused. Does he want to die?
00:20:23.680,00:20:25.265,"No, I just don't want to stick."
00:20:31.813,00:20:33.440,"Hey. Hey, let me out."
00:20:34.566,00:20:36.652,I'll show you where me pot o' gold is.
00:20:36.735,00:20:39.321,Maybe he is a leprechaun. He's dancing a jig.
00:20:39.404,00:20:40.781,"No, he's just boiling."
00:20:47.162,00:20:51.291,"Judging from the height of these tongue marks, this house has recently been licked by an elf."
00:20:54.836,00:20:56.672,Has anyone else come by here today?
00:20:56.755,00:20:59.925,"No, no, no. But come in. Make yourself casserole."
00:21:00.008,00:21:01.677,"I mean, comfortable."
00:21:06.807,00:21:10.519,"Do you like ham? This is like ham, but it's not ham."
00:21:10.602,00:21:13.939,How cute. It looks like a little monkey all roasted up with onions.
00:21:14.022,00:21:17.234,"Ja. It does, but it's not. Eat."
00:21:24.783,00:21:27.202,"Whatever it is, it's delicious."
00:21:40.590,00:21:42.968,You served me Elfo?
00:21:43.051,00:21:44.469,I thought I didn't like him.
00:21:45.971,00:21:50.434,Don't be a dummy bear. Elf is dessert meat. It's still cooking.
00:21:51.685,00:21:53.478,"-Ow! -Help, help!"
00:21:53.562,00:21:55.063,I'm allergic to apples!
00:21:58.233,00:22:00.610,Oh. Make yourself casserole. Now I get it.
00:22:08.910,00:22:12.956,"God, what did they marinate you in, man? It smells out of this world."
00:22:23.091,00:22:24.593,"I'll save you, sister."
00:22:35.062,00:23:30.951,The blow pop! It's gonna-- but it's not ham.
00:23:34.079,00:23:35.664,"Okay, guys? Okay."
00:23:36.248,00:23:40.627,"All right, the creepy laughter has to stop before we can have a real conversation."
00:23:41.253,00:23:42.838,"Guys, give yourselves up."
00:23:42.921,00:23:47.426,Everyone will understand why you went crazy after the witch imprisoned you for so many years.
00:23:51.888,00:23:53.723,And then the witch kidnapped you?
00:23:57.602,00:24:00.355,So we tied her to the sink and started eating people.
00:24:00.439,00:24:01.898,Bean! Behind you.
00:24:03.024,00:24:06.528,"-Bean, kill him. Do not wuss out. -I don't think I can."
00:24:08.196,00:24:13.410,"Gretel, no! We were supposed to grow old together and eat a family."
00:24:23.420,00:24:28.300,Hey! Whoa. Hey! Whoa. Words! The curse is lifted.
00:24:29.926,00:24:31.344,There's my real laugh.
00:24:31.970,00:24:34.723,"Bean, look at me. Don't look at me, look at the corpses."
00:24:34.806,00:24:39.519,"You did it. You finally killed someone, intentionally. I am so proud of you."
00:24:39.603,00:24:41.146,It was self-defense.
00:24:41.229,00:24:45.317,Don't be modest. You killed these mentally ill siblings fair and square.
00:24:45.400,00:24:49.196,And I got roasted alive. I guess we all did our part.
00:25:00.040,00:25:04.002,nothing feels better than sparing the life of one innocent person.
00:25:09.925,00:25:14.304,You saved my life and rid me of that awful curse.
00:25:14.387,00:25:16.389,It's been a horrible ordeal.
00:25:16.473,00:25:20.810,But my one solace is knowing I can return to my beautiful candy home.
00:25:20.894,00:25:26.983,And spend my remaining years tending to my twin sister who lives in the attic.
00:25:33.615,00:25:36.201,"Traveling is fun, too. Right?"
00:25:42.832,00:25:46.127,"Princess Tiabeanie, step forward."
00:25:46.211,00:26:03.019,"For outstanding bravery, foresight and wisdom, I hereby award myself this medal for the extraordinary parenting that turned you from a worthless, bucktoothed degenerate to a ruthless executioner with a beautiful smile."
00:26:03.103,00:26:05.730,"-I'm proud of you, Beanie. -Really?"
00:26:05.814,00:26:07.399,Not that you care what I think.
00:26:07.482,00:26:10.777,"Yeah, I'm kinda cool that way. Thanks, Pops."
00:26:10.860,00:26:14.906,Mention my buckteeth again and I'll use them to bite out your spinal cord.
00:00:40.373,00:00:49.507,"Next to present their bountiful harvest for His Majesty's blessing and immediate confiscation, he's a farmer with six teeth. She's his wife with none."
00:00:49.591,00:00:52.510,Ole and Alice!
00:00:53.178,00:00:57.182,"-That is wheat, Your Highness. Wheat. -What?"
00:00:57.265,00:00:58.141,-Wheat. -What?
00:00:58.224,00:00:59.309,-Wheat. -What?
00:00:59.392,00:01:00.310,-Wheat. -What?
00:01:00.393,00:01:01.519,-Wheat. -What?
00:01:01.603,00:01:02.604,-Wheat. -What?
00:01:02.687,00:01:05.482,"Ah, I'm just screwing with you, liven things up a little."
00:01:05.565,00:01:06.775,"Gimme the thing, will you?"
00:01:06.858,00:01:11.821,"Blessings to you, from your greasy hair to your filthy, ripped-up shoes."
00:01:11.905,00:01:14.699,"-Those are his feet, Your Highness. -Those are feet?"
00:01:14.783,00:01:17.494,"Well, it's understandable. They are leathery."
00:01:17.577,00:01:19.788,"Plus, there's laces holdin' the skin on."
00:01:19.871,00:01:21.331,Next!
00:01:21.414,00:01:26.503,"Tedrick the shepherd and Daisy, the one sheep you haven't eaten yet."
00:01:26.586,00:01:32.675,"I made you the biggest, itchiest wool sweater I could, but if it's too snug, you can give it to your fat, wimpy son."
00:01:32.759,00:01:35.595,"Eh, we'll give it to Bean."
00:01:35.678,00:01:38.264,She doesn't care at all about her appearance.
00:01:38.348,00:01:41.392,"Bean, thank this nice creep so he'll move along."
00:01:41.476,00:01:42.560,Where'd she go?
00:01:42.644,00:01:45.480,"She said if I told you, she'd hurt Mr. Bear."
00:01:45.563,00:01:46.856,What?
00:01:48.191,00:01:52.946,I only ask that girl to do two things: Sit here and stay sober.
00:01:53.029,00:01:56.241,And she never does neither. Gimme my damn scepter.
00:02:05.250,00:02:06.751,"Nice toss, Dad."
00:02:10.588,00:02:14.425,"-And give this guy a double. -Oh, well, aren't you sweet?"
00:02:20.723,00:02:23.685,"Okay, okay, okay, I got one. Who's this?"
00:02:26.688,00:02:29.816,"Oh, oh, oh. One of your fiancés? That guy you murdered?"
00:02:29.899,00:02:32.527,"What's-his-name, the Forgettable... Guysbert."
00:02:32.610,00:02:34.529,"Ding, ding, ding! Whoo!"
00:02:38.283,00:02:46.040,"I'm a big, fat king, and I'm married to a salamander, and my daughter has a dangerous drinking problem."
00:02:46.124,00:02:47.417,Zog! Drink!
00:02:52.172,00:02:53.756,"Hi, I'm Elfo."
00:02:53.840,00:02:54.757,"Ooh, ooh, I know."
00:02:54.841,00:02:58.428,"The guy with the goofy shoes, reeks of flop sweat and licorice..."
00:02:58.511,00:03:01.848,"Oh, he's really annoying. What's his name? I wanna say Quelfo?"
00:03:06.519,00:03:10.231,"Good try? Let's drink anyway, right?"
00:03:12.483,00:03:13.818,-Hay man. -What?
00:03:13.902,00:03:15.820,"No, they've almost finished the hay man."
00:03:15.904,00:03:17.739,"-What? The hay man? -What the hey, man?"
00:03:17.822,00:03:20.491,I'm talking about the hay man for the harvest bonfire.
00:03:20.575,00:03:25.496,"It's the best night of the year, but Zog never lets me go."
00:03:25.580,00:03:28.041,He doesn't trust me 'cause he thinks I'm just a dumb kid.
00:03:28.124,00:03:30.251,That's so sad you never get to go.
00:03:30.335,00:03:33.338,"No, no, I go every year. He just never lets me."
00:03:33.421,00:03:36.507,Hmm. I can't quite figure out why he doesn't trust you.
00:03:36.591,00:03:40.595,"All right, we got a big day tomorrow. Let's grab one last drink for the road."
00:03:59.447,00:04:03.743,"Oh, floor, you're always there for me. So supportive."
00:04:03.826,00:04:07.997,"Not like walls and staircases, always getting in my way."
00:04:11.459,00:04:13.753,"And in this kingdom, that's sayin' something."
00:04:16.464,00:04:19.634,"'Cause before, you said it was prehensile. So, just saying."
00:04:20.969,00:04:23.137,-Bean's getting yelled at by her dad. -Ow!
00:04:23.221,00:04:26.391,You ran off from your royal duties to get drunk.
00:04:26.474,00:04:30.979,"Oh, so, you noticed? You weren't too busy with your new family?"
00:04:31.062,00:04:33.481,New? I've been remarried for years.
00:04:33.564,00:04:36.985,"And since that time, I've become less and less important to you."
00:04:37.068,00:04:40.613,You barely noticed when I traded places with that pauper for a year.
00:04:43.199,00:04:46.911,"I'd like to have a role to play in your life, in the kingdom."
00:04:46.995,00:04:48.579,I'm tired of feeling useless.
00:04:49.706,00:04:53.918,"Ah, Beanie, it's so hard to know what to do without yellin'."
00:05:03.344,00:05:08.224,I don't see problem. Your daughter feel useless because she is useless.
00:05:08.308,00:05:09.350,But she's hurtin'.
00:05:13.438,00:05:15.231,"Make offspring, like Derek."
00:05:15.315,00:05:17.775,I can't sleep with Mr. Bear like this.
00:05:17.859,00:05:21.195,"Vip, Vap, escort Derek back to his room, huh."
00:05:21.863,00:05:25.825,I don't know. I don't want Bean to be unhappy. Can't we throw her a bone?
00:05:25.908,00:05:31.581,"Well, sire, we do have the upcoming trip to Dankmire, but it's a rather delicate diplomatic mission."
00:05:31.664,00:05:36.210,Perfect. Give her some phony-baloney job with a fancy title and a sash.
00:05:38.087,00:05:42.425,Aren't ambassadorships usually just given to rich chumps to make them feel important?
00:05:42.508,00:05:46.137,"Yeah, and it's working. Express boat to Dankmire."
00:06:02.862,00:06:05.156,Ugh. Tourists.
00:06:16.084,00:06:19.337,-Those're mosquito bites. -I'm scratching with excitement.
00:06:19.420,00:06:22.673,"Hey, hey, peewee, no bleeding. Your blood belongs to me."
00:06:23.257,00:06:25.426,"Oh, this is so interesting."
00:06:25.510,00:06:28.471,Did you know Dreamland forced Dankmire to build this canal?
00:06:28.554,00:06:40.400,"Then, they fought a 100-year war over who owns the canal, and the war only ended when a certain King Zog of Dreamland, your dad, married Princess Oona of Dankmire. That's your weird stepmom."
00:06:40.483,00:06:41.984,"Yeah, I remember their wedding."
00:06:42.068,00:06:44.195,I got jealous and put a dead owl in their cake.
00:06:44.278,00:06:48.282,"-People, like, ate the whole thing. -Hey! That's in here, too."
00:07:04.882,00:07:08.928,"-Wow! Beautiful. -Oona, you grew up here."
00:07:09.011,00:07:13.266,"Can you just tell me about this place, and I'll try to decipher your accent?"
00:07:13.349,00:07:18.354,Don't worry. Every visitor to Dankmire receives a famously warm welcome.
00:07:25.570,00:07:31.659,"Warm refers to the sweltering temperature, not the notoriously grim locals."
00:07:31.742,00:07:34.036,"Hmm, this is where Oona gets her sense of humor."
00:07:34.120,00:07:37.165,Is true. I was class clown.
00:07:37.248,00:07:38.791,Is joke.
00:07:38.875,00:07:40.126,Or is?
00:07:46.632,00:07:50.094,They consider it rude to bow without bowing first.
00:07:50.178,00:07:52.889,-I can tell this place already sucks-- -...ceeds at...
00:07:52.972,00:07:55.683,-Blowing-- -...away our expectations.
00:07:55.766,00:08:04.150,"Your Highness, on behalf of all of Dreamland, may I just say thank you for this charming reception."
00:08:13.034,00:08:17.538,"Hey, hey, now that's diplomacy. Show us what else you got."
00:08:17.622,00:08:25.588,"Mr. Chancellor, we are at your disposal and keen to experience more of your local culture. What's next?"
00:08:25.671,00:08:29.175,"-A play, in 16 acts. -Ah."
00:08:29.258,00:08:30.718,Performed by children.
00:08:33.262,00:08:35.348,Yay!
00:08:43.356,00:08:46.776,"Stupid fish, always takin' my precious body butters."
00:08:57.078,00:09:04.961,"It's taken centuries, but our civilization has literally risen out of the muck to have one of the finest community playhouses around."
00:09:06.379,00:09:10.800,"Oh, uh, that's our way of saying hmm."
00:09:13.511,00:09:16.389,You will love this play about our glorious canal.
00:09:16.472,00:09:19.016,This thing better not be a musical.
00:09:19.100,00:09:23.729,"No, but it is one of those plays where the actors come out into the audience and bother people."
00:09:31.821,00:09:35.575,"You cannot stop Dankmirian progress, swamp people."
00:09:53.259,00:10:03.769,"And thus, the 500-year war was over, and Dankmire and Dreamland share the beautiful canal and the marriage of convenience."
00:10:03.853,00:10:06.522,Who's that fat kid with the crown supposed to be?
00:10:06.606,00:10:09.525,All hail Dankmire.
00:10:10.067,00:10:12.361,Thank you for coming.
00:10:15.323,00:10:16.657,What the hell was that?
00:10:16.741,00:10:19.201,They're acting like we didn't contribute to that canal.
00:10:19.285,00:10:25.041,"As ambassador, I have to remind you to not act like a caveman."
00:10:25.124,00:10:27.668,-Say something nice. -No.
00:10:27.752,00:10:33.507,"On behalf of Dreamland, I'd like to say that that was a fine show."
00:10:33.591,00:10:36.761,That husky kid's a real tour de force.
00:10:38.763,00:10:40.348,"All right, you did good."
00:10:40.431,00:10:44.685,Covering up the indiscretions of those in power is an important part of the job.
00:10:44.769,00:10:47.605,Why don't you give the big speech at tonight's banquet?
00:10:47.688,00:10:49.649,What? Me? Speech?
00:10:49.732,00:10:53.736,I've never written a speech before. I guess I could try.
00:10:53.819,00:10:59.909,"You'll do great, as long as you remember our entire flimsy alliance depends on it going perfect."
00:10:59.992,00:11:02.161,"-Oh. -Okay, good things."
00:11:02.244,00:11:05.373,You're a great writer. I've read your diary.
00:11:15.675,00:11:20.096,"Everything is riding on this speech. Luckily, Dad gave me his notes."
00:11:21.222,00:11:22.390,Wing it?
00:11:27.812,00:11:31.565,"Hey, welcome to Muddruckers. I'm Chazz. Would you like to order a drink?"
00:11:31.649,00:11:34.360,Or you want to keep working on that decorative centerpiece?
00:11:43.077,00:11:46.330,You got Chazz'd. I'll bring you what you deserve.
00:11:47.081,00:11:48.374,Just soda for me!
00:11:48.457,00:11:49.792,I'm on a deadline.
00:11:50.376,00:11:56.340,"When in the course of human events... No, that's stupid, stupid."
00:11:59.677,00:12:01.595,I'm never gonna be able to do this.
00:12:01.679,00:12:04.098,I've known a lot of writers. Most of 'em go to Hell.
00:12:04.181,00:12:08.728,And the one surefire way to unleash your creative juice is with creative juice.
00:12:08.811,00:12:10.271,No. No alcohol.
00:12:10.354,00:12:13.691,"Lucille, stop it. You're being a bad influence."
00:12:13.774,00:12:16.569,"Hey, I'm an enabler. There's a big difference."
00:12:16.652,00:12:20.823,"Here you go. Booze, booze and boring."
00:12:20.906,00:12:22.491,"Ooh, what is this?"
00:12:22.575,00:12:25.119,Extra-strong Dankmirian Schnapps.
00:12:25.202,00:12:28.581,"One shot is all you need. So, I brought you two."
00:12:33.043,00:12:35.254,See? I don't even miss the alcohol.
00:12:56.108,00:12:57.902,"She's here. Take it away, Bean."
00:13:02.406,00:13:04.825,Her ceremonial robe. It's backwards.
00:13:10.748,00:13:13.042,Whoo! How do you like me now?
00:13:13.125,00:13:14.794,"Aw, jeez. What are you doing?"
00:13:17.004,00:13:20.382,-What happened to you? -It's not her fault.
00:13:20.466,00:13:21.967,That's right. It's your fault.
00:13:23.469,00:13:28.349,"You should be proud of me, Dad. I finished my speech and all the nachos."
00:13:28.432,00:13:31.018,You're in no shape to deliver any speech.
00:13:33.687,00:13:35.856,I'll get Derek to give the speech.
00:13:35.940,00:13:38.984,He's part Dankmirian. At least he appeals to someone.
00:13:39.068,00:13:43.322,What? You're gonna entrust the future of our kingdom to that twerp?
00:13:43.405,00:13:49.995,"Considering that twerp is heir apparent to the throne on whom the future of our kingdom already rests, yeah."
00:13:51.330,00:13:52.665,Let us feast.
00:13:57.336,00:13:58.337,Whoa!
00:14:01.215,00:14:04.260,"Unless it's a boiled pear, they're not interested."
00:14:24.280,00:14:27.533,"So, why don't you stand up and say a few words?"
00:14:27.616,00:14:32.705,"Who, me? But I don't know how to-- Just butter 'em up with a nice toast."
00:14:32.788,00:14:34.456,"Okay, I'll try."
00:14:36.417,00:14:40.963,"Hello, there. My name is Bonnie Prince Derek of Dreamland."
00:14:41.046,00:14:45.259,"I am here tonight to butter your nice toast. Right, Dad?"
00:14:48.053,00:14:50.306,My nanny always does it for me.
00:14:50.389,00:14:52.683,"Sometimes, I like marmalade, too."
00:14:53.183,00:14:57.062,Have you ever had apple butter? That's something I might also have.
00:14:57.146,00:14:59.690,"Uh-oh. I'll save you, bro."
00:15:05.696,00:15:09.909,Tiabeanie Mariabeanie De La Rochambeaux Drunkowitz.
00:15:09.992,00:15:13.162,Remember the name. Remember the face.
00:15:13.245,00:15:17.249,Remember that time you had that play and my dad was the fat kid?
00:15:17.333,00:15:19.251,That was awesome.
00:15:19.335,00:15:22.922,I'm so sorry that we had that long war.
00:15:23.005,00:15:24.465,"I mean, that sucked."
00:15:24.548,00:15:30.471,But I think we can all agree one thing: We kicked your asses.
00:15:31.889,00:15:35.643,"Hey, look at this. I got sleeves like a bat."
00:15:44.818,00:15:48.405,"Watch it. Watch out, or I'm gonna..."
00:15:50.199,00:15:51.617,Ooh! Hang upside down.
00:15:51.700,00:16:11.845,"Uh, so, in conclusion, Dreamland never had a better friend than Dankmire, Pay no attention to the naked ambassador on the chandelier."
00:16:14.348,00:16:15.432,"Oh, boy."
00:16:22.189,00:16:24.984,-I'm gonna-- -Stop. You're just smearing it around.
00:16:25.067,00:16:26.276,This is an outrage.
00:16:26.360,00:16:31.615,"By appointing Ambassador Tiabeanie, you've told us everything we need to know about our alliance."
00:16:45.421,00:16:47.131,Come on. This way.
00:16:48.340,00:16:50.676,How did you know that was there?
00:16:50.759,00:16:53.178,"Uh, unlike some people, I read the guidebook."
00:17:00.269,00:17:03.856,Just once could we go on a family vacation without having to run away screaming?
00:17:07.609,00:17:09.611,Hold them off while I untie the barge.
00:17:09.695,00:17:11.613,I'll stop those jerks dead in their tracks.
00:17:13.032,00:17:15.284,Here goes nothing.
00:17:35.345,00:17:37.389,"Okay, let's go. Let's go. Come on!"
00:17:43.187,00:17:44.688,"Quickly, the lock."
00:18:02.247,00:18:04.249,I'll see you at home!
00:18:04.333,00:18:06.668,"Mommy, I'm afraid!"
00:18:18.263,00:18:23.185,"Great job, Bean. I hope you can sense my sarcasm through your drunken haze."
00:18:23.268,00:18:25.646,"Yeah, yeah, I stink. Derek, get on Dad's back."
00:18:31.902,00:18:33.112,I'll get you!
00:18:33.695,00:18:34.696,Unless you keep going.
00:18:38.200,00:18:41.620,No need. They're heading deep into muskrat territory.
00:18:41.703,00:18:44.289,The swamp monster will take care of them.
00:18:52.798,00:18:56.552,I began to realize my clothes had grown muddy.
00:19:01.098,00:19:05.435,"Man, I really blew it. I was crazy to think I could be an ambassador."
00:19:05.519,00:19:08.355,This is why I always tell you not to try things.
00:19:08.438,00:19:12.067,-Stop it. You're too discouraging. -You're too encouraging.
00:19:12.151,00:19:14.570,"Oh, yeah? Why don't you do something about it?"
00:19:14.653,00:19:16.780,Come on. I'm encouraging you.
00:19:20.492,00:19:22.953,Oh! Ah! Ah! Stop it!
00:19:24.371,00:19:26.039,You're not even a little nice.
00:19:26.123,00:19:32.754,"You know what you are? You're bad through and through, from the tip of your pointy tail to the tips of your pointy ears."
00:19:32.838,00:19:36.216,"Ho, ho! You wanna come at me about some pointy ears?"
00:19:36.300,00:19:37.843,Have you ever seen your reflection?
00:19:38.927,00:19:39.887,"Oh, my God."
00:19:40.470,00:19:41.889,I'm a freak.
00:19:51.565,00:19:54.818,"Oh, this log is hard. I miss my tuffet."
00:19:54.902,00:19:58.280,"-You miss your tuffet, do you? -Oh, ever so much."
00:19:58.363,00:20:02.784,And your pet swans? And your little sled for your toy bear?
00:20:02.868,00:20:04.119,Do you miss those?
00:20:04.203,00:20:06.205,-Uh-huh. -Aw.
00:20:06.288,00:20:08.665,Get down there and dig a pit for us to sleep in.
00:20:10.167,00:20:13.253,"Keep quiet, if y'all know what's good for y'all."
00:20:13.337,00:20:17.674,You boys waltzed into the wrong swamp. You our property now.
00:20:17.758,00:20:23.347,Property? Men don't own me. I own men. I'm King Zog!
00:20:23.847,00:20:24.765,Zog?
00:20:24.848,00:20:27.851,"-Ain't you the king from Dreamland? -Indeed, I am."
00:20:30.145,00:20:34.066,"We gonna have some king-sized fun with you, boy."
00:20:38.737,00:20:39.738,I've had it.
00:20:39.821,00:20:44.243,"The next one of you who lays a hand on the other one gets left behind, okay?"
00:20:44.326,00:20:45.410,Ow!
00:20:45.494,00:20:46.912,"Congratulations, guys."
00:20:46.995,00:20:50.791,"You're the first people in history to make me say, I'd rather be with my dad."
00:20:52.918,00:20:53.877,Dad?
00:20:59.633,00:21:02.636,What do you want? Gold? Jewels?
00:21:02.719,00:21:04.388,"Here, here, take my crown."
00:21:04.471,00:21:09.893,"Yeah, I reckon we don't want none of that. We just wanna even the score."
00:21:09.977,00:21:11.853,The score? What did I do?
00:21:11.937,00:21:16.358,I know it's you what built that canal. It drove me and all my kin off our land.
00:21:16.441,00:21:19.820,Come on. It wasn't my fault. I was just giving orders.
00:21:19.903,00:21:24.199,"Orders? Coincidentally, we about to cook up an order..."
00:21:25.284,00:21:30.289,"of king à la king and grilled shrimpy. No, I'm kidding."
00:21:30.372,00:21:32.582,We just gonna fry y'all up in some butter.
00:21:34.960,00:21:38.338,-Don't worry. We ain't gonna eat you. -I knew that.
00:21:38.422,00:21:42.050,We're cooking y'all up for the swamp monster.
00:22:03.655,00:22:05.407,Nobody fries my dad.
00:22:05.490,00:22:11.079,Yeah? Which one of y'all gonna stop us? Skinny girl? Kitty cat? Gross baby?
00:22:14.291,00:22:18.086,"Elfo, Luci, let's show these yokels how we city folk do things."
00:22:18.670,00:22:19.796,Ow!
00:22:21.506,00:22:25.635,"When we got the set, I never thought these little ones would come in handy."
00:22:28.805,00:22:36.730,"Since y'all was screamin' like babies in the frying pan, we gone to plan B: Feed you to the monster raw."
00:22:38.648,00:22:41.443,"Okay, plan C: Stuff 'em with breadcrumbs."
00:22:41.526,00:22:42.611,No! No!
00:22:44.488,00:22:50.077,"Don't be rude, Dad. Let's respect the customs of our colorful hosts."
00:22:50.160,00:22:56.500,May I propose a toast? I got some low-grade pocket hooch in my booty flask.
00:22:56.583,00:23:00.629,Please accept it as a gift from my kingdom to your... this.
00:23:00.712,00:23:02.589,"Well, thank you, Miss, uh..."
00:23:02.672,00:23:05.550,This is the Honorable Ambassador Tiabeanie...
00:23:05.634,00:23:08.970,"Shh. I'm Bean, okay? Help yourself."
00:23:09.054,00:23:11.681,Oh. That's right kindly of you.
00:23:11.765,00:23:16.686,"I guess maybe there's a world where I could let y'all go, and we could be friends."
00:23:17.354,00:23:20.065,"Yeah. Hey, both you hicks, drink up."
00:23:20.148,00:23:21.566,What'd he just call us?
00:23:21.650,00:23:24.861,"I believe he called us hicks, Slim."
00:23:24.945,00:23:26.947,"Oh, he should not have done that."
00:23:27.030,00:23:30.617,I should've knowed it. All you royals are the same.
00:23:30.700,00:23:36.123,"You think we're all just a bunch of unsophisticated, backwoods, know-nothin' yokels who don't know nothin'!"
00:23:36.206,00:23:39.960,"-Well, I'll tell you what we do know. -What do we know?"
00:23:40.043,00:23:43.046,We know we about to feed them to the swamp monster.
00:23:43.130,00:23:46.425,'Cause you know that swamp monster don't take no for an answer.
00:23:46.508,00:24:24.087,"He comes at you when you least ex-- You know, I realized that you do encourage Bean to do lots of things: drink, sneak out, fib."
00:24:24.171,00:24:27.048,"Yeah, you get it, man. Steal, cheat, toy with your feelings."
00:24:27.132,00:24:29.426,"Yes, exactly."
00:24:29.509,00:24:32.762,"-Put 'er there, pal. -Wow. Gotta admit, I'm impressed."
00:24:35.474,00:24:37.350,"Really, really impressed. Ow!"
00:24:37.476,00:24:39.269,"Okay. Hey, stop."
00:24:39.352,00:24:41.313,"Elfo. Elfo, knock it off. Gimme my tail back."
00:24:43.899,00:24:46.526,That was some great diplomacy back there.
00:24:46.610,00:24:50.030,You talked to those hillbillies like you were from the next swamp over.
00:24:53.408,00:24:56.369,"Like I always say, I'm proud of you, Bean."
00:24:57.287,00:24:59.498,"You've never said, I'm proud of you."
00:24:59.581,00:25:03.001,"Well, today I got dangerously close."
00:25:10.926,00:25:13.136,"Hey, Dad, is it cool if I go?"
00:25:13.220,00:25:16.973,"Oh, sometimes, I could swear I'm looking at your mother."
00:25:17.057,00:25:21.269,"-Go on, but sneak home by sunup, or-- -You'll cut off all my toes."
00:25:21.353,00:25:23.313,I'll leave you one for good luck.
00:25:24.105,00:25:25.190,Thanks.
00:25:30.487,00:25:32.614,"Well, that looks like you, Father."
00:25:32.697,00:25:36.159,"Yeah, I know. Let's go home. Quickly."
00:25:36.868,00:25:38.912,You know what we'll do when we get home?
00:25:45.126,00:25:48.880,"We can do it together. Or, better yet, have the servants do it."
00:25:53.426,00:25:57.430,"Oh, I'm gonna have bad dreams about that skillet."
00:00:28.570,00:00:32.699,Drink the fairy! Drink the fairy!
00:00:33.324,00:00:36.202,"That's okay, honey. I go down easy."
00:00:45.003,00:00:49.591,"If you could be any mythical creature, what would it be? Elfo?"
00:00:52.510,00:00:56.222,"Man, if I was a dwarf, I'd run this town."
00:01:01.895,00:01:05.565,I had a good time in there. Your organs know how to party.
00:01:06.357,00:01:11.196,"Guys, we should go home before we pass out in the street. Again."
00:01:20.288,00:01:22.832,So tragically young.
00:01:22.916,00:01:25.043,So tragically small.
00:01:35.887,00:01:36.888,What the...
00:01:37.388,00:01:38.431,Ow!
00:01:38.515,00:01:41.726,"Oh, no, no, no. This is bad."
00:01:41.810,00:01:42.977,What is happening?
00:01:43.061,00:01:46.147,"Elfo, don't freak out. Just stay calm."
00:01:46.231,00:01:47.148,"Yeah, like this guy."
00:01:52.529,00:01:55.865,All we have to do is find a way out before they...
00:01:56.950,00:01:58.993,Was she gonna say before they light it on fire?
00:01:59.077,00:01:59.953,She was.
00:02:04.040,00:02:06.793,I haven't lived long enough to give up on my dreams yet.
00:02:06.876,00:02:08.837,I never got to see the world.
00:02:08.920,00:02:10.421,We only just met.
00:02:10.505,00:02:12.882,There are so many things we could have done and then tried.
00:02:12.966,00:02:15.176,Why didn't we give in to our instincts?
00:02:15.260,00:02:17.637,It's too bad we never experienced bliss together.
00:02:17.720,00:02:21.432,"We can, Bean. There's nothing in our way, except this arm."
00:02:23.059,00:02:24.894,"Oh, Elfo..."
00:02:24.978,00:02:26.771,"Oh, Bean."
00:02:26.855,00:02:29.232,You meant bliss the feeling.
00:02:29.315,00:02:31.317,There's another kind of bliss?
00:02:31.401,00:02:34.654,"Yeah, it's a drug. It makes you hallucinate."
00:02:34.737,00:02:38.074,You can do it in the Black Light District. I always wanted to try it.
00:02:38.158,00:02:40.785,"Well, good stuff. We should get you two outta here."
00:02:40.869,00:02:43.246,You knew that was there the whole time?
00:02:43.329,00:02:44.664,"Yeah, saw it on the way down."
00:02:58.720,00:03:01.222,"Elfo, it's okay, really."
00:03:01.306,00:03:06.728,"I think it's sweet you wanted to kiss me, but I'm just-- Kiss you? You think I was trying to kiss you?"
00:03:11.816,00:03:13.234,You weren't trying to kiss me?
00:03:13.318,00:03:15.278,"Uh, definitely not."
00:03:15.361,00:03:21.784,"'Cause it seemed like--- Okay, take it easy. I have a girlfriend, and I'm not just making it up on the spot."
00:03:21.868,00:03:26.414,"Speaking of the spot, isn't this the spot? Let's talk about the spot now."
00:03:31.044,00:03:34.505,"Welcome, my friends. One adult, two children."
00:03:41.095,00:03:43.348,Get ready to have your minds blown.
00:03:49.854,00:03:52.398,I don't feel it yet. How much longer?
00:03:52.482,00:03:54.442,Let's just all take another deep breath.
00:03:56.194,00:03:57.028,Good idea.
00:03:57.111,00:04:00.865,"And on the exhale, Elfo will tell us more about his girlfriend."
00:04:00.949,00:04:04.035,"-Dude. -Yeah, who is this mystery girl?"
00:04:04.118,00:04:08.748,"She's not a mystery, but she's definitely a girl. Friend."
00:04:08.831,00:04:09.958,She's my girlfriend.
00:04:10.041,00:04:13.169,"Hmm, kinda took you a long time to bring her up, though."
00:04:13.253,00:04:15.838,It sorta seems like you might be a liar.
00:04:15.922,00:04:16.965,You callin' me a liar?
00:04:17.048,00:04:18.549,"Oh, that's the stickiest."
00:04:18.633,00:04:21.469,That's just real sticky coming from a friend.
00:04:21.552,00:04:24.389,"So, why haven't we met your little bitty elf squeeze?"
00:04:24.472,00:04:27.183,"She's not an elf, and she's not little!"
00:04:27.267,00:04:30.436,She's big! Bigger than you'll ever be!
00:04:30.520,00:04:34.357,"Okay, okay. So, what does this big love of yours look like?"
00:04:34.440,00:04:35.692,I know what she looks like.
00:04:35.775,00:04:38.820,"She's got white hair, buck teeth and two blue eyes."
00:04:38.903,00:04:44.158,"Wrong. She has red hair, normal teeth, no offense, and one green eye."
00:04:44.242,00:04:45.702,"Wait, did you say one eye?"
00:04:45.785,00:04:48.955,"Yeah, that's right. Yup, now I'm remember... Just the one. Yup."
00:04:49.038,00:04:51.582,"Well, now I'm really curious to meet her."
00:04:51.666,00:04:54.294,"You can't! 'Cause, uh..."
00:04:54.377,00:04:55.295,Damn it!
00:04:59.382,00:05:01.384,"Yes, really far away."
00:05:01.467,00:05:04.470,"Like, way up the country, past the Unpassable Mountains?"
00:05:04.554,00:05:05.471,Even farther.
00:05:05.555,00:05:07.724,Then how did you two meet?
00:05:07.807,00:05:11.686,"Um, on vacation. Yup. With our families."
00:05:11.769,00:05:14.314,"Oh, such a great time."
00:05:17.025,00:05:19.736,"so you can't look 'em up or anything. Just, you know, natural causes."
00:05:19.819,00:05:23.823,"So, super-hot one-eyed girl with a dead family. Sounds legit."
00:05:23.906,00:05:27.869,Because she is legit and totally real and very special to me!
00:05:27.952,00:05:29.829,"Okay, okay, Elfo, we get it."
00:05:29.912,00:05:32.582,Now calm down. I'm starting to hallucinate.
00:05:35.543,00:05:43.176,"Whoa. It's like I'm looking at you, but at the same time, you're being looked at by me."
00:05:43.259,00:05:47.221,Your nose is so beautiful. Everything's so unreal.
00:05:55.730,00:05:57.982,"Mmm, mmm."
00:06:11.496,00:06:15.041,"Look into my heart, and you'll see the truth."
00:06:36.771,00:06:38.106,What happened to you guys?
00:06:38.189,00:06:42.235,"Elfo, I owe you an apology, man. I totally saw your girlfriend back there."
00:06:42.318,00:06:44.821,I also had this profound realization.
00:06:45.780,00:06:48.991,"I'm losing it now, but I think it was about scones?"
00:06:49.075,00:06:50.618,Let's get scones.
00:06:58.501,00:06:59.877,"Great practice, men."
00:06:59.961,00:07:02.422,I think we're fully prepared to slay a dragon.
00:07:02.505,00:07:06.008,It was fun stabbing all those iguanas in that box.
00:07:07.844,00:07:09.262,no matter how hard I laughed.
00:07:09.345,00:07:11.722,Did you ever stop to think that's because it's true?
00:07:11.806,00:07:13.057,"Nah, I was busy with laughter."
00:07:13.141,00:07:15.893,"I don't know, man. There's something to that vision I had."
00:07:15.977,00:07:18.062,"That girl is real, and he's in love with her."
00:07:23.693,00:07:25.862,I meant we should go find his girlfriend.
00:07:25.945,00:07:28.614,"-And by we, I mean them. -Ya!"
00:07:28.698,00:07:32.785,"Hey, hey, sorry to interrupt, but are you guys available for a quest?"
00:07:34.579,00:07:35.913,You were saying?
00:07:37.331,00:07:42.003,"Remember: really tall, red hair and, again, just the one eye."
00:07:42.086,00:07:44.755,And she lives beyond the Unpassable Mountains?
00:07:44.839,00:07:48.634,You're gonna send these knights to die on a quest for a made-up girlfriend? Cool.
00:07:48.718,00:07:51.846,This wasn't a stupid drug trip. This was a vision of the truth.
00:07:51.929,00:07:55.308,"I crawled through a door and saw a rainbow, and I'd risk their lives on it."
00:07:55.391,00:07:57.393,Is this quest optional?
00:07:57.477,00:08:00.062,"Silence, Turbish. We'll have her to you in a fortnight."
00:08:00.146,00:08:02.940,"Don't know how long that is, but you have three days."
00:08:03.024,00:08:04.734,You gotta get her here before the Royal Ball.
00:08:04.817,00:08:08.905,"Elfo will need someone to dance with, and I am not letting him stand on my feet again."
00:08:08.988,00:08:13.159,"And if we succeed, how shall I be rewarded?"
00:08:16.412,00:08:19.415,"Now, will you shut up down there? I'm trying to sleep."
00:09:09.465,00:09:11.217,"Hmm, I'll hit mute."
00:09:13.970,00:09:16.806,"Personally, I prefer to watch the news."
00:09:16.889,00:09:18.432,Hey! News!
00:09:18.516,00:09:22.228,Is your dinner poisoned? The answer may surprise you.
00:09:22.311,00:09:25.982,"But, first, we go live to the courtyard for the return of the knights."
00:09:27.733,00:09:29.110,Come along.
00:09:39.912,00:09:45.459,"I knew that you were longing for something, so I had the knights get it."
00:09:45.543,00:09:46.502,What is it?
00:09:46.586,00:09:48.421,Does this voice sound familiar?
00:09:53.843,00:09:55.761,"No, stupid, it's your girlfriend!"
00:09:58.848,00:10:00.891,"Elfo, you mofo."
00:10:00.975,00:10:04.270,"I thought you were a liar, but it turns out you're a stud."
00:10:08.232,00:10:10.359,"How was your trip, sweetie?"
00:10:16.616,00:10:19.327,Traveling makes her cranky.
00:10:23.414,00:10:26.292,We ain't having no giant rampage in here.
00:10:29.295,00:10:32.381,"Come on, Dad. You can't stand in the way of true love."
00:10:32.465,00:10:34.425,He's an elf. She's a giant.
00:10:34.508,00:10:36.886,It's gotta be so hard for them already.
00:10:36.969,00:10:39.138,"-I mean, think about it. -Mmm."
00:10:42.850,00:10:46.354,Put her somewhere where I can't see her. What's under the dungeon?
00:10:47.688,00:10:51.359,"All right. Stick her down there, and bring me a nice hunk of Gorgonzola."
00:10:52.693,00:10:55.821,Why am I the only one defending your girlfriend?
00:10:55.905,00:10:57.114,What kind of boyfriend are you?
00:10:57.198,00:10:59.950,"Uh, a supportive one. She can fight her own battles."
00:11:00.034,00:11:01.160,She's 12 feet tall.
00:11:01.243,00:11:04.121,She did throw Turbish off a cliff and eat his horse.
00:11:11.629,00:11:14.215,Think you can make a bed outta one of these cheeses?
00:11:14.298,00:11:15.758,Anything but the Pepper Jack.
00:11:22.181,00:11:28.270,"Pendergast is gonna take her chains off so you can get on in there, if you know what I'm sayin'."
00:11:28.354,00:11:30.731,I'm talking about the cave. Just go.
00:11:30.815,00:11:31.941,I'm rooting for you.
00:11:43.703,00:11:45.496,we're both imprisoned.
00:11:45.579,00:11:47.790,"You, like a wild animal."
00:11:47.873,00:11:50.835,"Me, in a complex web of lies."
00:12:04.014,00:12:07.101,"Oh, sorry. Didn't see you down there. What's shakin', bacon?"
00:12:07.184,00:12:09.228,"Not my loins, I'm afraid."
00:12:09.311,00:12:11.772,Stay where you are. I'll come tell you.
00:12:11.856,00:12:14.024,Ugh. Why has no one eaten him yet?
00:12:16.652,00:12:20.281,"Cat-thing, I've always been my own man, never needed others for advice."
00:12:20.364,00:12:22.366,"But now I'm a pig, and my life's a mess."
00:12:22.450,00:12:25.077,"Well, glad we had this talk. See ya."
00:12:25.619,00:12:29.999,"Thing is, having been handsome, powerful and rich, I never had to stoop to kindness or charm."
00:12:30.082,00:12:32.710,But now those things are gone and so are the ladies.
00:12:32.793,00:12:38.591,"So, tell me why the damsels flock to you, someone far more repulsive than yours porkly."
00:12:38.674,00:12:42.970,"I would love to give you some great advice, but it will come at a great cost!"
00:12:43.679,00:12:46.599,-I get to ride you like a horse. -I'll welcome the touch.
00:12:46.682,00:12:48.642,Now we must get started at once.
00:12:48.726,00:12:51.061,I need a date for the ball this Sunday.
00:12:51.145,00:12:57.193,"Okay, let's fire up the magic crystal and see if there's any attractive singles in our area waiting to talk to you."
00:12:58.360,00:12:59.236,Him?
00:12:59.945,00:13:01.489,-No. -Hmm.
00:13:01.572,00:13:04.992,"Want me to ask if you're gonna die alone, or are we good?"
00:13:16.462,00:13:21.926,"Oh! Oh, thank God I got away. With so many things last night."
00:13:22.009,00:13:24.303,"Wow, looks like it got pretty rough."
00:13:24.386,00:13:29.725,"Yeah, I don't want to brag, but, at one point, I got my head stuck in her eye socket."
00:13:29.809,00:13:33.646,"I'm glad you're enjoying your time together, because I had a great idea."
00:13:33.729,00:13:35.815,"Oh, goody. Another one."
00:13:51.831,00:13:56.502,"Pardon my curiosity, but when you two are making love, is she aware?"
00:13:58.671,00:14:02.842,Don't listen to him. You're obviously a great couple.
00:14:02.925,00:14:06.262,"Hi, I'm Chazz. Pretty rose for the pretty lady?"
00:14:06.345,00:14:08.514,"-Absolute-- -No, thanks. I'm good."
00:14:12.935,00:14:16.647,"No flower could have a stench as beautiful as yours, honey."
00:14:26.824,00:14:27.992,Looks like it.
00:14:28.993,00:14:33.998,"Ugh! That was stuck in my throat for days! Oh, my mouth tastes like a barn."
00:14:34.081,00:14:35.583,She can talk?
00:14:39.086,00:14:42.131,The hell is wrong with you people? Get these things off me.
00:14:43.424,00:14:48.262,"I am not a monster. I'm a person, with thoughts and feelings."
00:14:48.345,00:14:50.431,"For God's sake, I'm a grad student."
00:14:50.514,00:14:53.559,That's why I love her. She's so darn smart.
00:14:53.642,00:14:57.187,I can't believe you all put me through this 'cause I'm his girlfriend.
00:14:57.271,00:15:04.778,"Well, have I got news for you. This guy is a filthy-- Lover! I'm a filthy lover. So nasty."
00:15:06.614,00:15:08.782,This just raises more questions.
00:15:13.495,00:15:14.788,What is your problem?
00:15:14.872,00:15:17.458,I just need to talk to you. Please. I'm sorry.
00:15:17.541,00:15:21.211,"Really. I know I'm a jerk and a liar, Miss Giant Lady."
00:15:21.295,00:15:23.380,"My name is Tess. Ugh, I'm outta here."
00:15:23.464,00:15:24.715,"No, please."
00:15:24.798,00:15:28.719,"Tess, if you don't stay until the Royal Ball tomorrow, they'll know I'm lying."
00:15:28.802,00:15:30.304,Why would I do you any favors?
00:15:30.387,00:15:33.265,'Cause I'll do anything. I can get you money.
00:15:33.349,00:15:35.976,There's a ton of money in the castle. I can steal.
00:15:36.060,00:15:37.311,Money means nothing to me.
00:15:37.394,00:15:39.939,"Oh, come on. Everybody needs something."
00:15:40.022,00:15:41.315,Don't you need something?
00:15:42.066,00:15:44.068,An eye. Your eye is missing!
00:15:45.736,00:15:48.238,You're missing an eye. I can get you one.
00:15:48.322,00:15:49.657,-Easy. -How?
00:15:49.740,00:15:53.661,"Uh, because I'm an elf. And elves are magic, duh!"
00:15:53.744,00:15:57.206,We can make eyes. We can make anything.
00:15:57.289,00:16:00.834,-You can? -Yes! Absolutely.
00:16:00.918,00:16:03.462,You help me keep up the charade a bit longer.
00:16:03.545,00:16:06.882,We dance a little. We go to a party. Eh?
00:16:06.966,00:16:09.426,Big gal like you like parties?
00:16:09.510,00:16:11.011,I guess.
00:16:11.095,00:16:15.099,"Then we will have you walking out of here with 20/20, my friend."
00:16:17.267,00:16:19.937,I thought you were just gonna give me a hunk of glass.
00:16:20.020,00:16:22.564,"That would've been the easy way out, huh?"
00:16:22.648,00:16:25.985,"But, no. No, not for this guy."
00:16:26.068,00:16:29.613,"Wow. All right, yeah, you have a deal."
00:16:29.697,00:16:31.824,But I'm going back to dinner. I'm so hungry.
00:16:31.907,00:16:32.908,You could eat a horse?
00:16:32.992,00:16:35.369,-Don't try to be my friend. -You betcha.
00:16:43.544,00:16:46.588,"If you're gonna dance with someone tonight, we'll work with what you got."
00:16:46.672,00:16:50.884,And what you got are serious problems in the face and body areas.
00:16:50.968,00:16:53.846,-Fine. -You need an attitude that matches you.
00:16:53.929,00:16:56.015,You're sad and hideous. Play it up.
00:16:56.098,00:16:57.558,Chicks love pathetic.
00:16:57.641,00:17:00.060,I don't know. I'm not good at anything.
00:17:00.561,00:17:01.645,Like that?
00:17:06.942,00:17:08.235,Sad...
00:17:10.237,00:17:14.033,"Ew. Look at that gross, crying pig. I have no interest in it."
00:17:14.116,00:17:15.868,Me neither. Twinsies.
00:17:16.702,00:17:18.162,Get outta here!
00:17:20.998,00:17:23.083,"Oh, my God. Cute cat."
00:17:23.167,00:17:26.587,"I know. So much swagger, right? He's, like, ugly-sexy."
00:17:26.670,00:17:28.589,"Oh, yeah. Totes. Like your dad."
00:17:28.672,00:17:29.548,What?
00:17:30.340,00:17:31.341,"Hello, there."
00:17:33.844,00:17:36.180,"Perhaps I'll see you in the dining room, then?"
00:17:42.895,00:17:45.606,What are you coming to me for? We don't got that kind of relationship.
00:17:45.689,00:17:48.942,"Oh, I'm desperate. Please, I'll do anything."
00:17:49.026,00:17:50.152,Anything?
00:17:59.745,00:18:01.497,I've been messing with this for a couple days.
00:18:05.459,00:18:09.880,Is there anything around here I can use to replace a giant's eye?
00:18:11.006,00:18:12.132,"Eh, we gave it a shot."
00:18:29.566,00:18:30.734,I'm not dangerous.
00:18:30.818,00:18:32.611,This is your hair and makeup team.
00:18:32.694,00:18:36.657,You're already beautiful. We're just gonna highlight a few things.
00:18:36.740,00:18:38.575,Bring in the hot tar!
00:19:30.794,00:19:32.880,Now let's greet our hosts.
00:19:32.963,00:19:36.425,She oozes grace and a shiny trail wherever she goes.
00:19:36.508,00:19:39.052,He ate all the shrimp before you got here.
00:19:42.347,00:19:46.768,"Make room on the dance floor, 'cause I'm full of shrimp and I need to lay down."
00:19:46.852,00:19:52.482,"Princess, now that we're courting-- Don't say courting. No one's courting. But you can bring me a drink."
00:19:52.566,00:19:55.194,But you're already... All right.
00:19:57.070,00:19:58.071,You scoundrel.
00:19:58.155,00:20:01.241,You said to act pathetic to these women. Then you swept in and stole them.
00:20:01.325,00:20:03.327,I know. Some of my best work.
00:20:03.410,00:20:04.703,I thought we were friends.
00:20:04.786,00:20:07.831,The Adventures of Cat and Pig. That's what I've been calling us.
00:20:08.498,00:20:09.333,To who?
00:20:09.416,00:20:13.670,"All I wanted to do was dance in the arms of someone beautiful, and you took that away."
00:20:13.754,00:20:15.672,This has been our last adventure.
00:20:15.756,00:20:17.758,"Oh, man, I actually feel kind of bad."
00:20:17.841,00:20:19.176,Do you need to be alone?
00:20:19.259,00:20:21.345,"Oh, no, I need to be comforted."
00:20:21.428,00:20:23.096,Maybe a little behind the ears.
00:20:23.180,00:20:25.515,"And now, our guests of honor."
00:20:25.599,00:20:28.894,Brace yourselves for the inevitable visualizations.
00:20:28.977,00:20:31.063,Elfo and Tess!
00:20:46.036,00:20:48.580,"So, one quick dance, then you can go back home."
00:20:48.664,00:20:50.457,But the eye's not working yet.
00:20:50.540,00:20:52.459,"Huh, weird."
00:20:52.542,00:20:55.921,"May not be seeing well, but it is looking good."
00:20:56.004,00:20:57.923,Just gotta straighten it out here.
00:20:59.216,00:21:00.634,What the hell?
00:21:00.717,00:21:02.427,"Wait, something's happening."
00:21:02.511,00:21:05.389,I can see out of it. I can see everything.
00:21:05.472,00:21:09.977,More than everything. I see the truth.
00:21:10.060,00:21:13.605,He's sleeping with the chambermaid. And she's sleeping with the chambermaid.
00:21:13.689,00:21:16.316,What can I say? I'm attracted to people who are good at their job.
00:21:16.400,00:21:22.114,"And you, you're so kind, but you have a hidden rage inside you that no one else can see."
00:21:22.197,00:21:24.283,It's why I can't keep a dog alive.
00:21:24.366,00:21:26.910,You only keep Elfo around for his blood.
00:21:29.079,00:21:31.039,"Oh, you know what? I think I already knew that."
00:21:31.123,00:21:34.626,And you. You're not at all what you seem. You're a prince.
00:21:34.710,00:21:38.463,"Yes, I was the handsomest prince in all the land."
00:21:38.547,00:21:40.882,He's not lying. He really believes that.
00:21:40.966,00:21:43.010,And now for Elfo...
00:21:45.679,00:21:46.888,Here's the truth.
00:21:48.181,00:21:49.516,Let me do it.
00:21:50.392,00:21:54.688,"Bean, I should've confessed this a long time ago, but I was too ashamed."
00:21:54.771,00:21:57.607,Tess was never my girlfriend.
00:21:57.691,00:21:59.943,I've been lying to you about that.
00:22:00.027,00:22:02.279,"Oh, um, well, I wasn't gonna say that at all."
00:22:05.115,00:22:07.576,You were lying? But my mystical vision.
00:22:07.659,00:22:12.998,"I crawled through the hole, the giant lady popped out of the flower, and you were there and... Oh, drugs are bad."
00:22:15.917,00:22:20.130,"We don't want to upset the nice big lady, huh?"
00:22:21.131,00:22:24.301,You don't think I'm nice. None of you do.
00:22:24.384,00:22:28.889,You all think I'm a big scary monster who's gonna go on a rampage.
00:22:28.972,00:22:31.099,"Well, newsflash."
00:22:31.183,00:22:33.935,Giants haven't been on a rampage since the '80s.
00:22:34.019,00:22:36.271,"And even then, it was one guy."
00:22:36.355,00:22:38.065,It was just Bob.
00:22:38.148,00:22:45.614,"Maybe if you got to know us, you'd find out that we're all about peace and love and goddamn body positivity!"
00:22:45.697,00:22:49.826,But I guess we'll just always be ugly beasts to you.
00:22:49.910,00:22:52.954,"Well, fine. Think I'm ugly all you want."
00:22:53.038,00:22:55.916,At least I'm not ugly on the inside.
00:22:55.999,00:23:00.545,I've come to slay the mean lady who threw me off a cliff and ate my horse.
00:23:03.256,00:23:04.341,What?
00:23:06.718,00:23:09.721,"Oh! Damn it. Let me get that. Hang on. No, wait."
00:23:09.805,00:23:10.806,"Oh, God."
00:23:11.431,00:23:12.724,No. Stop.
00:23:12.808,00:23:14.309,I've got this.
00:23:14.976,00:23:17.646,-She's burning the castle! -She'll eat us alive!
00:23:17.729,00:23:19.731,This validates my bigotry!
00:23:19.815,00:23:22.984,She's been a burden on the pantry. Kill her.
00:23:27.072,00:23:31.243,Monsters are afraid of fire. We've got her cornered.
00:23:39.084,00:23:40.502,"Tess, follow me."
00:23:40.585,00:23:41.878,Why should I trust you?
00:23:41.962,00:23:44.840,"Because sometimes I feel like a freak, too."
00:23:48.927,00:23:51.680,"Wow, you're trapped in a pretty sad life."
00:23:51.763,00:23:53.515,Want me to go back and step on your dad?
00:23:53.598,00:23:54.975,"No, we don't have time."
00:24:09.656,00:24:10.824,Quick! This way.
00:24:12.742,00:24:13.827,We're trapped.
00:24:13.910,00:24:15.328,"No, we're not."
00:24:15.412,00:24:17.414,"Now, Tess, I know you're not a monster."
00:24:17.914,00:24:22.127,But I'm gonna need you to jump up and down. Like a monster.
00:24:22.210,00:24:23.545,"That was implied, right?"
00:24:27.799,00:24:31.845,Whoa. Are you the 9:30 bus to Twinkletown?
00:24:34.556,00:24:37.559,Take a deep breath and fire on the count of three.
00:24:39.352,00:24:41.354,One... two...
00:24:45.484,00:24:47.861,What were we just talking about?
00:24:51.615,00:24:53.825,-Where'd she go? -Which one's the giant?
00:25:00.916,00:25:03.335,"Tess, I'm so sorry about everything."
00:25:03.418,00:25:06.922,"Well, you helped me out of here, so I guess it's cool."
00:25:07.005,00:25:10.008,-It is? -No! You're a dick.
00:25:10.091,00:25:12.928,None of this would've happened if you'd just told the truth.
00:25:13.011,00:25:14.012,God!
00:25:16.765,00:25:19.434,Take me with you. These savages don't deserve us.
00:25:19.518,00:25:21.436,"-Come on, cutie. -Really?"
00:25:27.067,00:25:30.153,I was a gorgeous nobleman before I became a pig.
00:25:30.237,00:25:32.531,What were you before you turned hideous?
00:25:42.082,00:25:44.543,I should have known she wasn't your girlfriend.
00:25:44.626,00:25:46.419,I should have just told you the truth.
00:25:46.503,00:25:49.506,I lied because I was too insecure to admit I tried to kiss you.
00:25:49.589,00:25:53.176,But you don't have to worry. I won't try anything like that again.
00:25:53.260,00:25:55.887,Good. Let me do it next time.
00:26:00.850,00:26:03.812,"Bean, did... did you just kiss me?"
00:26:03.895,00:26:06.815,I don't know. I don't think I'm Bean.
00:26:06.898,00:26:08.441,I don't think I'm Elfo.
00:00:42.500,00:00:47.964,"Remember, Dagmar, when we used to sneak into church to smooch on this very spot?"
00:00:57.057,00:00:59.267,I wish you were here for Beanie.
00:01:03.938,00:01:05.732,"Oh, who am I kidding?"
00:01:05.815,00:01:07.776,I wish you were here for me.
00:01:11.571,00:01:14.866,"Hard on the outside, but on the inside..."
00:01:17.494,00:01:20.205,Who said you could watch the Oracle Fire?
00:01:24.626,00:01:25.835,Show me the wizard.
00:01:35.887,00:01:37.138,Doink.
00:01:42.060,00:01:44.062,This better be the Elixir of Life.
00:01:47.232,00:01:49.526,"-What? -Apologies, Your Highness."
00:01:49.609,00:01:55.281,"I seem to have accidentally invented a truth serum, you gravy-swilling blowhard! Oh."
00:01:55.365,00:01:58.243,Truth serum? No king wants to hear the truth.
00:01:58.326,00:01:59.869,I want the key to life!
00:01:59.953,00:02:03.289,You've had elf blood for weeks and what do you got to show for it?
00:02:03.373,00:02:07.001,"Well, I created a shampoo that can make any animal laugh."
00:02:09.587,00:02:11.756,How do I know he didn't used to do that?
00:02:11.840,00:02:19.764,"Make the Elixir of Life or I'll throw you in a wizard-proof cage, which for you is a cardboard box with a brick on it."
00:02:22.142,00:02:24.561,Promise me you won't attend my funeral.
00:02:42.287,00:02:45.915,now we're in this weird limbo place and we don't know what we're doing.
00:02:45.999,00:02:48.960,I know exactly what we're doing. We're shopping for turnips.
00:02:58.511,00:03:01.806,"Remember how people used to just work, starve or eat?"
00:03:04.184,00:03:09.981,Entertainment is just a tool that pacifies the masses and leads to the decay and ultimate collapse of civilization.
00:03:10.565,00:03:11.691,Let's clap along.
00:03:14.736,00:03:16.404,"Move your fat ass, please."
00:03:16.487,00:03:19.616,Ugh. I really don't like the view from down here.
00:03:19.699,00:03:23.494,I love to sway and bounce to the music.
00:03:49.604,00:03:50.855,Miss Moonpence?
00:03:52.649,00:03:54.859,Do I have an audience with the king this morning?
00:03:56.653,00:03:59.364,I've got a lot of official matters to take care of.
00:04:01.032,00:04:02.867,I wonder what's for lunch.
00:04:04.994,00:04:06.537,With spring vegetables.
00:04:07.538,00:04:08.790,And gravy.
00:04:10.625,00:04:11.960,They're out of gravy.
00:04:13.544,00:04:14.796,"Oh, I'm in trouble, Oddie."
00:04:14.879,00:04:18.925,I can't crack the Elixir of Life no matter how much I abracazab and alakazoo.
00:04:19.008,00:04:20.385,I'm a fraud!
00:04:20.468,00:04:21.552,"I am, aren't I?"
00:04:21.636,00:04:25.306,"As a friend and lover, there is none truer than you."
00:04:25.390,00:04:28.059,These hands... I thought they had magic.
00:04:28.142,00:04:30.853,"They do, and they will."
00:04:30.937,00:04:33.648,I just don't know how to work with this elf blood.
00:04:33.731,00:04:35.483,It's like it's made of crazy sauce.
00:04:35.566,00:04:38.069,I've tried every spell in the book I have.
00:04:38.152,00:04:41.030,Then perhaps you need a new book.
00:04:47.120,00:04:51.082,"You see, there was another practitioner of the dark arts here."
00:04:51.165,00:04:52.333,The Witch.
00:04:52.417,00:04:54.168,This was her lair.
00:04:54.877,00:04:57.922,That's gonna need more than a fresh coat of frosting.
00:05:03.970,00:05:04.971,Hmm.
00:05:09.892,00:05:15.315,The ancient book of spells and easy Sunday dinners of which only two copies are known to exist!
00:05:15.398,00:05:19.819,The other belongs to Collecticus and is still sealed in its original box.
00:05:21.070,00:05:22.071,Hmm.
00:05:22.613,00:05:24.699,Hmm? Hmm.
00:05:24.782,00:05:27.618,Elixir Vitae con Arroz.
00:05:36.753,00:05:40.423,"I've been stalking you, but you have come to me."
00:05:40.506,00:05:44.093,"Oh, you're a stranger. I've heard about you."
00:05:44.177,00:05:45.970,"Now, where's my candy?"
00:05:53.102,00:05:54.437,Elfo! Where are you?
00:06:45.363,00:06:47.240,Have you seen it? So bulky.
00:06:47.323,00:06:51.285,"I prefer to stay safe the old-fashioned way, running like a coward."
00:06:53.413,00:06:56.040,"Your Highness, I have miraculous news."
00:06:56.124,00:06:58.126,"Great, let me turn this off."
00:07:00.920,00:07:02.213,"Oh, no."
00:07:03.464,00:07:08.052,"Sire, we have found the secret to making the Elixir of Life using elf's blood."
00:07:08.136,00:07:08.970,And?
00:07:09.053,00:07:14.142,"The blood must be distilled in a special vial, known as the Eternity Pendant."
00:07:21.774,00:07:23.609,"But we looked, and it's not there."
00:07:24.652,00:07:27.655,But we can mount a crusade to find the vial.
00:07:28.698,00:07:30.867,But at least we have the elf.
00:07:30.950,00:07:32.702,Elfo has been kidnapped!
00:07:32.785,00:07:35.163,"Fine, fine, on with the whacking."
00:07:35.246,00:07:38.958,Hey! That picture was on the wagon they took Elfo away in!
00:07:39.041,00:07:40.376,Belay the whacking.
00:07:40.460,00:07:47.175,"Your Highness, whoever kidnapped Elfo knows about that vial, which means-- They're also after the Elixir of Life."
00:07:47.258,00:07:49.510,"Find the vial, and we find Elfo."
00:07:49.594,00:07:51.929,Send all the knights on a quest for the vial!
00:07:52.013,00:07:53.681,Cancel all other quests.
00:07:53.764,00:07:55.933,We'll find the one true god next year.
00:08:01.564,00:08:04.484,"-Summon our stealthiest assassin. -Right here, sir."
00:08:09.572,00:08:13.576,"my lady, and Mertz's mother, who insisted on coming."
00:08:17.163,00:08:22.627,"We embark on our quest to bring immortality to our lord and ruler, the King of Dreamland."
00:08:25.922,00:08:27.590,And find Elfo!
00:08:30.092,00:08:32.637,"But if you don't find him, maybe I'll introduce you to my son."
00:08:44.899,00:08:47.944,The Witch's spellbook is the key to everything.
00:08:48.027,00:08:51.155,We must find her and ask what she knows about the vial.
00:08:51.239,00:08:52.823,Her new place is just ahead.
00:08:52.907,00:08:57.203,"When their gingerbread house blew up, she and her sister downsized to a candy condo."
00:09:07.338,00:09:10.049,Would you care for some lightly cursed cookies?
00:09:13.261,00:09:15.513,"This was yours, was it not, Witch?"
00:09:15.596,00:09:17.348,"Please, call me Gwen."
00:09:17.431,00:09:21.352,"Actually, it belonged to my no-good ex-husband, Malfus."
00:09:21.435,00:09:24.605,"Ooh, I love it when people talk smack about their exes. Dish, girl!"
00:09:24.689,00:09:27.900,Malfus was obsessed with making the Elixir of Life.
00:09:27.984,00:09:31.904,"And once he found the Eternity Pendant, things went south."
00:09:31.988,00:09:33.823,So where is he now?
00:09:33.906,00:09:34.865,He went north.
00:09:34.949,00:09:39.829,He took himself far away from society to live atop the highest mountain in the land.
00:09:39.912,00:09:41.664,The Devil's Snowcone.
00:09:57.221,00:10:00.433,Do you dare enter the Cave of the Single Trap?
00:10:01.017,00:10:03.019,Which of you brave knights will enter first?
00:10:03.603,00:10:04.854,Probably him.
00:10:04.937,00:10:14.572,"Very well. They don't call me Now that the single trap has been triggered, I'm sure the cave is safe to enter."
00:10:18.075,00:10:23.039,"Okay, now that the two-part single trap has been triggered, the cave is even safer to enter."
00:10:23.122,00:10:24.081,Turbish? Mertz?
00:10:25.791,00:10:27.627,You're not sending my peanut in there.
00:10:27.710,00:10:28.919,Mom...
00:11:09.293,00:11:11.337,Are you Malfus the Philosopher?
00:11:11.420,00:11:12.880,I am.
00:11:17.426,00:11:25.267,"I am Sorcerio, Wizard of Wonder. Your traps are no match for-- Parties of three or more? Yes, I must do something about that."
00:11:25.351,00:11:27.978,"Now, look, we seek the Eternity Pendant."
00:11:28.062,00:11:31.524,Have you availed yourself of it and been blessed with immortality?
00:11:31.607,00:11:34.151,Immortality is a curse.
00:11:34.944,00:11:38.114,"When life is endless, so is everything else."
00:11:38.197,00:11:40.825,"The monotony, the repetition."
00:11:40.908,00:11:43.786,"The monotony, the repetition."
00:11:43.869,00:11:46.956,"The monotony, the repetition."
00:11:49.417,00:11:50.543,Where was I?
00:11:53.295,00:11:54.672,The monotony.
00:11:54.755,00:11:57.675,-Let me tell you a story. -Please don't.
00:11:57.758,00:12:00.845,I once knew a charming and brave maiden.
00:12:00.928,00:12:02.555,Her name was Gwen.
00:12:03.305,00:12:07.017,"And after all that, we fell for each other, hard."
00:12:07.101,00:12:14.859,The type of love that is forged in adventure That is so what I want.
00:12:14.942,00:12:16.861,Be careful what you wish for.
00:12:16.944,00:12:23.534,"We pledged our eternal love for each other and I thought, what if our love could actually be eternal?"
00:12:23.617,00:12:26.495,All it took was one drop of elf blood.
00:12:26.579,00:12:29.457,"I used it, but Gwen refused."
00:12:29.540,00:12:31.625,She was the smart one.
00:12:31.709,00:12:38.048,We'd already been married for 90 years and weren't sure our 17th dog was going to solve our problems.
00:12:38.132,00:12:39.717,"It did, for a while."
00:12:39.800,00:12:42.303,"But then it didn't, so we split."
00:12:48.934,00:12:52.813,I threw it over the Edge of the World.
00:12:52.897,00:12:54.482,There's such a place?
00:12:54.565,00:12:57.485,Just up Cherrywood Road. Take a right at the dance academy.
00:12:59.653,00:13:01.655,You need elf's blood.
00:13:01.739,00:13:04.158,"We have an elf. Or, at least, we had one."
00:13:04.241,00:13:05.451,He was kidnapped.
00:13:05.534,00:13:08.162,By someone with this symbol on their wagon.
00:13:08.245,00:13:10.456,You say they have your elf?
00:13:10.539,00:13:13.667,"If they get that vial, it will be cataclysmic!"
00:13:13.751,00:13:16.462,"Find him, and it, and them!"
00:13:16.545,00:13:18.964,"And maybe on the way, yourselves."
00:13:19.632,00:13:21.050,It's all in my book.
00:13:25.930,00:13:28.724,Let me give you a gift to help lift your tedium.
00:13:31.101,00:13:33.813,This is no ordinary horse.
00:13:36.774,00:13:44.031,Hooray. The cave will be filled with the sound of laughter and the smell of horse.
00:13:44.114,00:13:45.449,"Now, please, go."
00:13:45.533,00:13:48.953,The Eternity Pendant must not fall into the wrong hands.
00:13:49.036,00:13:51.997,"Malfus, how do you know we'll use the vial properly?"
00:13:52.081,00:13:53.541,You don't know anything about us.
00:13:53.624,00:13:56.710,"I know all about you, Tiabeanie."
00:13:56.794,00:13:58.671,But I didn't tell you my name.
00:13:58.754,00:14:01.090,"Well, it's a long story, I..."
00:14:08.597,00:14:12.601,The sound of your laughter brings me such joy.
00:14:12.685,00:14:14.478,So I'll eat your head last.
00:14:28.993,00:14:32.788,"They call it an edge, but it's really more of a gentle slope!"
00:14:33.956,00:14:36.500,"Well, we're never gonna find Elfo this way."
00:14:36.584,00:14:37.751,Is that all you care about?
00:14:37.835,00:14:39.837,I've lost three of my finest suits of armor.
00:14:39.920,00:14:40.880,And their contents.
00:14:40.963,00:14:43.090,"Aw, here's the world's smallest lute."
00:14:43.173,00:14:45.759,I'm gonna find out what they know in the gift shop.
00:14:46.677,00:14:50.931,"Say, Darrell, what happens to the stuff that goes over the edge?"
00:14:51.015,00:14:53.142,"It falls forever, I guess."
00:14:53.225,00:14:55.227,Has anyone ever gotten something back?
00:14:55.311,00:14:57.479,"Well, mostly people throw stuff they don't want back."
00:14:57.563,00:15:00.691,We also sell stuff people don't want. Do you want some?
00:15:00.774,00:15:03.736,For a shilling I can engrave it with the name of an unloved one.
00:15:03.819,00:15:06.363,"No, thanks, but I will take this rope."
00:15:06.447,00:15:08.282,Would you like it engraved for a shilling?
00:15:08.365,00:15:10.826,"What part of no, thanks do you not understand?"
00:15:10.910,00:15:12.536,The no part.
00:15:33.641,00:15:35.267,-What's up? -Why did you jump?
00:15:35.351,00:15:38.270,"Eh, Mrs. Mertz looked at me like she was gonna say something."
00:15:46.362,00:15:49.323,I didn't save you so much as you fell on me.
00:15:49.406,00:15:50.783,Make yourselves at home.
00:15:50.866,00:15:53.243,Would anyone care for regurgitated salmon?
00:15:53.327,00:15:55.537,No. That's gonna be a hard nope.
00:15:55.621,00:15:58.540,"No offense, but what the hell's up with your schnoz?"
00:15:58.624,00:16:02.920,"I'm a griffin. Half-man, half-bird, half-lion."
00:16:04.922,00:16:07.466,-You're a lady? -Gender is a spectrum.
00:16:07.549,00:16:09.635,Why are your people going extinct?
00:16:09.718,00:16:14.807,"These days, most men prefer to fornicate with something other than a giant bird."
00:16:14.890,00:16:17.726,I don't suppose any of you would be willing to help a gal out?
00:16:17.810,00:16:20.479,Is it cultural appropriation if I wear a beak?
00:16:20.562,00:16:23.774,"Dude, keep your cape on. Look at the stuff in his nest."
00:16:27.695,00:16:29.154,Many of them engraved.
00:16:29.238,00:16:32.282,"This one says I hate you, Darrell."
00:16:32.366,00:16:35.703,Did anything similar to this fall in?
00:16:35.786,00:16:38.455,No. But that exact thing fell in.
00:16:38.539,00:16:39.623,May we see it?
00:16:39.707,00:16:43.961,No. I traded it years ago to a king with a crown of snakes.
00:16:44.044,00:16:45.838,A king? From where?
00:16:45.921,00:16:47.881,The Lost City of Cremorrah.
00:16:47.965,00:16:49.299,Cremorrah?
00:16:52.594,00:16:54.013,It's that creepy exorcist!
00:16:54.096,00:16:55.431,"I have a name, you know."
00:16:55.514,00:16:57.099,Big Jo.
00:16:57.182,00:16:58.183,Indeed.
00:16:58.267,00:17:02.438,"Thank you for the information, Birdman. You've saved me a lot of time."
00:17:02.521,00:17:05.858,"Unlike other villains, I shan't be telling you my plan."
00:17:05.941,00:17:07.109,Good day.
00:17:09.570,00:17:13.824,"Oh, and in my mind, I'm not a villain. I think what I'm doing is good."
00:17:14.825,00:17:18.120,He must be the one who took Elfo. We gotta go after him.
00:17:18.203,00:17:20.080,"Birdman, activate!"
00:17:22.666,00:17:24.418,Any other requests?
00:17:30.174,00:17:31.925,Help! They tied us up!
00:17:32.009,00:17:34.219,"Hurry, my mom's gag is coming loose!"
00:17:34.303,00:17:37.347,Good luck with that. Giddyup!
00:17:42.895,00:17:44.188,"Faster, Porky!"
00:17:45.147,00:17:46.774,I have a brilliant idea.
00:17:46.857,00:17:49.526,"-Birdman, activate! -Oh, boy."
00:17:53.405,00:17:55.115,Damn it! Drop another one!
00:17:55.199,00:17:57.826,"All right, but I'll need 20 minutes and a big glass of milk."
00:17:57.910,00:18:00.245,"Well, you gotta drop something on them."
00:18:02.539,00:18:04.875,What the hell was the egg supposed to do anyway?
00:18:04.958,00:18:05.876,"Yeah, now what?"
00:18:05.959,00:18:09.671,We gotta sneak our way to the front. We'll take 'em by surprise.
00:18:14.343,00:18:15.886,Yeah!
00:18:21.475,00:18:25.395,We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
00:18:25.479,00:18:27.606,I'm all about the easy way.
00:18:38.200,00:18:40.744,Whoa!
00:18:40.828,00:18:43.288,Whoa!
00:18:48.460,00:18:50.796,"Elfo? Oh, my God, where are you?"
00:18:55.467,00:18:58.887,And there's something huge on top of me. Feels like a bear!
00:18:58.971,00:19:01.223,"Help, it's ripping it open!"
00:19:03.517,00:19:06.311,"Oh, Elfo, I'm so happy to see you!"
00:19:06.395,00:19:09.439,Look at your sweet face! I missed you so much!
00:19:09.523,00:19:11.358,"Oh, I missed you so much!"
00:19:11.441,00:19:14.528,Porky and Big Jo have a really toxic relationship.
00:19:16.697,00:19:19.867,Behold! The Lost City of Cremorrah!
00:19:20.659,00:19:22.578,"Eh, I've beheld better."
00:19:22.661,00:19:25.539,How are we supposed to find the vial if we can't even find the city?
00:19:25.622,00:19:29.543,"Legend has it, the Eternity Pendant is awakened by proximity to an elf."
00:19:29.626,00:19:32.629,"As Elfo nears it, the vial will give off a tone."
00:19:32.713,00:19:37.259,You expect me to crawl around this overheated hellscape until I hear a beep?
00:19:37.342,00:19:40.554,"No, Mr. Elfo, I expect you to fry."
00:19:53.358,00:19:55.777,"Thanks, Bean. I'm not burning anymore."
00:19:55.861,00:19:58.322,Now the only pain is humiliation.
00:20:04.077,00:20:05.871,A way in.
00:20:09.458,00:20:12.377,-What happened here? -Maru happened here.
00:20:13.921,00:20:16.757,I have no idea what that means. I'm just really short of breath.
00:20:16.840,00:20:21.428,Cremorrah was a kingdom of unimaginable wealth... of snakes.
00:20:21.511,00:20:25.891,Their thriving snake-based economy was the envy of the known world.
00:20:25.974,00:20:29.937,"People became so wealthy, their pockets were bursting with snakes."
00:20:30.020,00:20:36.526,"The neighboring kingdom of Maru, with its mouse-based economy, was both jealous and in constant peril."
00:20:37.110,00:20:42.616,"Maru decided to attack Cremorrah, but, with no army, they were forced to resort to magic."
00:20:42.699,00:20:47.204,They made a potion that could vanquish an entire kingdom without a single sword.
00:20:49.957,00:20:54.920,Maru flooded Cremorrah with the potion and the residents were instantly turned to stone.
00:20:55.003,00:20:56.880,But the king wasn't here.
00:20:56.964,00:21:00.717,"Clearly, his people had a wild wingding while he was away."
00:21:00.801,00:21:03.136,Can you imagine such disrespect?
00:21:07.099,00:21:10.936,"When the king returned, he found everyone frozen in place."
00:21:11.019,00:21:14.606,That must be why he sought the powers of the Eternity Pendant.
00:21:24.616,00:21:28.495,"He didn't have elf's blood, so he, too, was turned to stone."
00:21:28.578,00:21:30.706,"Still, he was the last to possess it."
00:21:30.789,00:21:33.333,"Find the king, find the vial."
00:21:52.519,00:21:56.857,Remember the solemn moment we first laid eyes on King Doris.
00:21:56.940,00:22:02.904,"Wow, one day you're an amazing civilization, the next you're a creepy spook-house."
00:22:06.533,00:22:10.495,Forty-five years of necromancing has led me to this moment.
00:22:10.579,00:22:13.874,"Porky, quit joking around and search the king."
00:22:20.881,00:22:22.591,You will never get the vial!
00:22:23.675,00:22:25.844,You're not a stone guard guy!
00:22:25.927,00:22:26.970,Who are you?
00:22:27.054,00:22:30.640,"I am an assassin from Maru, in the service of Emperor Cloyd."
00:22:30.724,00:22:32.142,And what is your charge?
00:22:32.225,00:22:36.480,To protect the Eternity Pendant! And to answer all questions!
00:22:37.064,00:22:39.900,Let's slip out under cover of all the clanking.
00:22:39.983,00:22:44.988,"Bean, wait. If we come home without the vial, your dad will pop a blood vessel. Probably one of yours."
00:22:45.072,00:22:48.241,We don't even know where it is. It's not on the frozen king guy.
00:22:57.918,00:23:00.796,Looks like a bunch of dead mice and...
00:23:10.222,00:23:12.557,Ha. Nothing to see here.
00:23:26.905,00:23:29.116,-Got ya! -No! Let go!
00:23:29.199,00:23:32.619,"Ha! Because of you, I lost a hand in that volcano."
00:23:40.210,00:23:42.212,No wonder Porky hates you.
00:23:44.673,00:23:45.924,Go!
00:23:50.262,00:23:52.514,Weren't you told not to let anyone take it?
00:23:52.597,00:23:55.851,"Not anyone, just you. My job is done."
00:23:55.934,00:23:58.019,"See you in Hell, weirdo."
00:24:02.357,00:24:04.484,Let's see how you like getting bottled up.
00:24:05.777,00:24:08.697,You'll never be able to fill this whole room with sand.
00:24:22.627,00:24:23.628,Whoa!
00:24:34.973,00:24:38.143,Our plan is even closer to fruition.
00:24:38.226,00:24:40.770,To the end of Dreamland.
00:24:46.193,00:24:50.906,"While I question their evil motives, it is nice to see them happy."
00:24:58.246,00:25:00.207,Immortality is folly.
00:25:00.290,00:25:07.797,"Those who desire it become blind to what is precious and right before them, our daily lives."
00:25:07.881,00:25:10.342,That we may live each day and say...
00:25:12.469,00:25:16.806,"You know, I'm profoundly lonely, but I think you should leave."
00:00:44.044,00:00:45.545,You're pacing again.
00:00:45.628,00:00:47.589,I got a lot on my mind.
00:00:51.342,00:00:52.594,What is wrong with you?
00:00:52.677,00:00:56.723,"For days, you don't eat, you don't sleep, you don't throw bricks at seagulls."
00:00:56.806,00:00:58.558,Where is the monster I married?
00:00:58.641,00:01:00.226,Oh... Where are they?
00:01:00.310,00:01:04.856,"Bean! If you're out there, say something!"
00:01:11.988,00:01:21.414,"The princess and her crew of misfits have been spotted returning from their quest by Lady Kravitz, who happened to be peering out her window at just the right moment."
00:01:21.498,00:01:22.791,Yes!
00:01:35.595,00:01:38.181,and remember everything from the night before.
00:01:38.264,00:01:41.142,You mortal nerds sleep good? We're almost home.
00:01:41.226,00:01:43.353,Woo-hoo! Back in Dreamland!
00:01:43.436,00:01:49.067,"This Eternity Pendant or vial or whatever you call it is gonna be my get-out-of-jail-free card for, like, ever."
00:01:49.150,00:01:50.693,I can do whatever I want!
00:01:50.777,00:01:52.487,I'm totally gonna get those bangs.
00:01:52.570,00:01:56.282,And I'll finally get the respect a man of my hat deserves!
00:01:56.366,00:01:58.326,"Ah, here we are."
00:02:02.413,00:02:05.834,from their quest that we all privately thought would fail.
00:02:12.632,00:02:15.718,"Your Highness, I have good news and bad news."
00:02:15.802,00:02:18.972,The good news is we have retrieved the Eternity Pendant.
00:02:19.055,00:02:22.642,"The bad news is that we lost many good men -and it was awful-- -Yeah, yeah."
00:02:22.725,00:02:25.478,"Great story, great story. Where's my pendant?"
00:02:29.566,00:02:33.194,"Ah, my dreams are this close to coming true."
00:02:33.278,00:02:35.238,"Now, where's my special little man?"
00:02:35.321,00:02:36.656,"I'm right here, Father!"
00:02:36.739,00:02:38.867,Not you! I'm lookin' for Elfo.
00:02:40.952,00:02:46.583,"To lift the curse of Death itself, one drop of blood from a true-born elf."
00:02:46.666,00:02:52.297,"Into the vial it shall drip, to free one soul from Death's icy grip."
00:03:01.681,00:03:04.601,Whoa. Am I turning into a god?
00:03:04.684,00:03:08.521,"I can feel the power rising up through my body, bursting out."
00:03:10.523,00:03:12.775,"Aw, I'm not a god."
00:03:12.859,00:03:15.153,I'm not even a healthy man.
00:03:15.236,00:03:17.197,"Oh, but it must've worked!"
00:03:17.280,00:03:20.909,"Now, to test it, we need a volunteer to kill you."
00:03:20.992,00:03:21.826,Dibs.
00:03:21.910,00:03:23.578,"Wait. Hang on, hang on."
00:03:23.661,00:03:27.248,"Let's try it on somebody a little more, uh, not me."
00:03:27.332,00:03:30.627,I think I know someone who'd welcome the attention.
00:03:31.211,00:03:33.880,"It is I, Prince Guysbert!"
00:03:33.963,00:03:40.136,"They tried to compost me, but the thought that, once again, I might gaze upon your face kept me alive."
00:03:40.220,00:03:42.222,That and the rotted food scraps.
00:03:44.557,00:03:47.894,You heard the shish kebab. Let's give it a shot!
00:04:03.910,00:04:07.205,My headache is gone!
00:04:17.131,00:04:19.550,"We lost him, but cured his headache."
00:04:19.634,00:04:24.639,"Ah, I shoulda never let you glue those stars on your dunce cap."
00:04:37.402,00:04:46.452,"Sire, we rode halfway across the world, lost three noble knights, failed to find the vial and we lost the princess..."
00:04:51.666,00:04:53.501,"Yeah, real successful."
00:04:53.584,00:04:56.504,How can you keep messing up a recipe with two ingredients?
00:04:56.587,00:04:59.549,"-Come here, you... -Ow, ow, ow..."
00:04:59.632,00:05:00.842,Your Majesty.
00:05:16.649,00:05:21.112,Son of a witch. I followed every possible interpretation of the directions.
00:05:21.195,00:05:22.780,Then what keeps going wrong?
00:05:22.864,00:05:24.407,Maybe the vial is a fake.
00:05:24.490,00:05:28.286,"It's gotta be real. I mean, it was glowing and dinging, okay?"
00:05:28.369,00:05:31.289,No substance known to man both glows and dings.
00:05:31.372,00:05:38.171,It could be a convincing knock-off made of cheaper magic materials like Middle Earth Zirconia or pleather.
00:05:38.254,00:05:39.547,We need an expert.
00:05:39.630,00:05:41.966,Hmm. I think I know a guy.
00:05:42.050,00:05:44.844,Fetch Old Man Touchy from the dungeon!
00:05:46.304,00:05:47.138,Who?
00:05:49.057,00:05:56.064,"There's nothing he's touched that he can't identify, and there's nothing he hasn't touched, which is why he's in the dungeon."
00:06:09.369,00:06:11.204,"Long time no feel, Your Highness."
00:06:12.789,00:06:15.375,It is an honor to fulfill your need for touch.
00:06:15.458,00:06:18.669,Good to see a twinkle in the holes where your eyes used to be.
00:06:18.753,00:06:20.421,And what a lovely tunic.
00:06:26.427,00:06:27.595,Touchy like.
00:06:29.472,00:06:31.057,"Now, here's the deal, Touchy."
00:06:31.140,00:06:36.813,This spell is only supposed to need two ingredients: this vial and this elf's blood.
00:06:36.896,00:06:38.439,But it's not working.
00:06:38.523,00:06:45.321,I need you to tell me if this vial is-- Guards! Guards!
00:06:48.074,00:06:51.369,"No, you sicko! Examine the vial, huh?"
00:06:51.452,00:06:53.621,Oh. If you insist.
00:06:54.831,00:06:55.915,The vial is real.
00:06:55.998,00:06:59.001,It's this specimen over here that requires further examination.
00:06:59.085,00:07:00.086,What?
00:07:01.087,00:07:02.922,"Ah, fascinating."
00:07:03.464,00:07:05.883,I've never felt anything like this before!
00:07:06.426,00:07:09.637,"This isn't an elf, but it's not not-an-elf."
00:07:09.720,00:07:13.349,"-He is, however, soft and velvety. -Thank you."
00:07:13.433,00:07:14.267,"Wait, what?"
00:07:14.350,00:07:15.977,What do you mean it's not an elf?
00:07:16.060,00:07:19.564,Your elf's blood won't work because this is not an elf.
00:07:22.900,00:07:24.152,Touch me somewhere else!
00:07:24.235,00:07:33.661,"So, this little twit, who I welcomed into my home, clothed and fed and built the finest luxury cage for, lied to me about being an elf?"
00:07:33.744,00:07:34.996,I didn't lie!
00:07:35.079,00:07:36.622,"Dad, don't be ridiculous."
00:07:36.706,00:07:38.749,"His name is Elfo, for Pete's sake."
00:07:38.833,00:07:41.252,Tacking an O on the end of Elf? Bah!
00:07:41.335,00:07:43.296,It's suspiciously on the nose.
00:07:43.379,00:07:45.465,This is crazy. I'm an elf.
00:07:45.548,00:07:47.383,My whole family are elves!
00:07:47.467,00:07:51.429,"If you look up elf in the dictionary, the picture is my cousin Examplo!"
00:07:51.512,00:07:55.349,"Ah, you. You ruined everything I worked for."
00:07:55.433,00:07:59.854,Lying to me in any other way than flattery is a mortal crime.
00:08:02.982,00:08:06.611,Elfo is hereby banished from Dreamland.
00:08:06.694,00:08:08.404,Get him outta here!
00:08:10.948,00:08:11.866,No!
00:08:18.414,00:08:19.957,"Goodbye, little man."
00:08:20.041,00:08:22.919,"If you get into trouble, show them this note."
00:08:25.713,00:08:27.632,Pendergast gave to me.
00:08:32.887,00:08:35.056,"Bean, I'll miss you!"
00:08:39.060,00:08:40.228,Stay what?
00:08:40.311,00:08:42.605,"Stay cool, never change."
00:08:43.356,00:08:44.815,Have a great summer.
00:09:09.882,00:09:11.425,How could you do this?
00:09:11.509,00:09:14.929,Elfo risked his life getting you that stupid vial!
00:09:19.517,00:09:21.477,You're the reason I have a drinking problem.
00:09:21.561,00:09:23.646,Of course I am. I'm your father.
00:09:23.729,00:09:25.856,You know what else you are? You're selfish.
00:09:25.940,00:09:27.066,You're a terrible king.
00:09:27.149,00:09:32.655,"And even if you do find a way to live for eternity, no one in their right mind would want to spend it with you."
00:09:33.823,00:09:34.991,Take her away.
00:09:35.074,00:09:37.660,Lock her up till she stops pointing things out.
00:09:37.743,00:09:39.161,"Her chamber, sire?"
00:09:39.245,00:09:41.956,"Nah, she's too good at escaping from there."
00:09:42.039,00:09:43.708,Some place more secure.
00:09:43.791,00:09:46.002,"And her smart-mouthed cat, too."
00:09:46.085,00:09:48.337,"Nice typical reaction, Mr. Predictable."
00:09:53.551,00:09:54.594,"There, there."
00:09:57.722,00:09:59.056,Let me out!
00:09:59.140,00:10:00.683,"If Elfo goes, I go!"
00:10:00.766,00:10:02.810,"No cannot do, Princess."
00:10:09.317,00:10:11.444,Go. Find your friend.
00:10:11.527,00:10:13.654,Wow. That's pretty decent.
00:10:13.738,00:10:15.823,I was not expecting that.
00:10:15.906,00:10:19.702,I wish you the best of luck embarrassing some other kingdom.
00:10:19.785,00:10:22.622,"-But were you expecting that? -Yeah, kinda."
00:10:25.916,00:10:29.587,-You let Princess run away? -For now.
00:10:36.218,00:10:38.929,Elfo! Elfo!
00:10:40.765,00:10:44.018,Wait a minute. It's just three quarters of a dead raccoon.
00:11:05.665,00:11:07.249,Who's there? Stay back!
00:11:07.333,00:11:08.501,I'm warning you.
00:11:20.179,00:11:21.889,Hi! I'm! Elfo!
00:11:25.810,00:11:28.479,You're the best friends I could ever imagine.
00:11:28.562,00:11:30.690,You do realize you're still hitting me?
00:11:30.773,00:11:33.526,"Yes, but I'm scared of what you'll do when I stop."
00:11:42.493,00:11:44.120,"Hey, hey, hey, slow down, champ."
00:11:44.203,00:11:46.872,"Oh, God, I'm turning into my bartender."
00:11:48.624,00:11:51.377,"Growing up, I never fit in among the elves."
00:11:51.460,00:11:52.878,"Listen, I feel you."
00:11:52.962,00:11:56.257,"After my mom died, I felt like I didn't fit in anywhere, really."
00:11:56.340,00:11:58.092,I never even met my mom.
00:11:58.175,00:12:00.428,Maybe that's why I've had such low elf-esteem.
00:12:00.511,00:12:03.180,"Dude, you can't have elf-esteem. You're not an elf."
00:12:03.264,00:12:06.892,You're never gonna be whole until you figure out who you really are.
00:12:06.976,00:12:09.353,And there's only one way to find the answer.
00:12:10.354,00:12:14.066,"No. No, I can't go crawling back home!"
00:12:14.150,00:12:16.652,It'll wreck my image as a total badass.
00:12:16.736,00:12:19.321,"What'd you do, forget to return a library book?"
00:12:22.283,00:12:25.202,But you'll never know the truth unless you return to Elfwood.
00:12:25.286,00:12:30.124,"The only problem is, the location is a secret, and elves are never supposed to bring outsiders."
00:12:30.207,00:12:32.543,"-You're not an elf. -Oh, yeah!"
00:12:46.932,00:12:49.185,Elfwood! We're here!
00:12:50.770,00:12:54.732,"Okay, they're suspicious of outsiders, so let's be smart about this."
00:12:54.815,00:13:10.581,"I'm Clarence, you're a scrappy, small-town reporter doing a story on Elfwood, and you're-- Uh, can we come in? Please?"
00:13:13.334,00:13:15.085,I don't know if that's a good idea.
00:13:18.255,00:13:20.007,"Wow, I didn't know elves were racist."
00:13:21.759,00:13:23.928,How can the world's greatest race be racist?
00:13:24.011,00:13:25.638,And would a racist do this?
00:13:40.110,00:13:43.280,"Whoa! I owe you an apology, Elfo."
00:13:43.364,00:13:45.950,"Relatively speaking, you're a badass."
00:13:46.534,00:13:50.204,"It's times like this I wish I had 3,000 fists."
00:13:50.871,00:13:52.289,Welcome to Elfwood!
00:13:52.373,00:13:55.626,Home of open-minded elves of all shapes and one size.
00:13:55.709,00:13:56.836,"Right, Watcho?"
00:13:56.919,00:14:00.339,Hmm. I'll be watching and judging and generalizing.
00:14:04.802,00:14:07.263,I am so sorry. It was an accident.
00:14:09.098,00:14:11.725,"-Oh, I am so sorry. Let me-- -Oh!"
00:14:13.394,00:14:16.188,Just go inside before you help me to death.
00:14:36.876,00:14:38.627,Wha?
00:14:38.711,00:14:43.007,"There, once again, Elfo, you've made a mockery of the Jolly Code!"
00:14:43.090,00:14:44.967,"Who is that puny, little runt?"
00:14:48.137,00:14:49.763,And who is that?
00:15:04.403,00:15:07.323,"Elfo, I didn't know you were coming back."
00:15:07.406,00:15:09.992,I didn't know I had unfinished business here.
00:15:10.075,00:15:13.662,-There's someone I'd like you to meet. -Whoa!
00:15:14.496,00:15:16.749,What? But how could he be...
00:15:19.251,00:15:21.003,That's all it takes.
00:15:22.171,00:15:24.381,All this time I didn't know I had a son!
00:15:24.465,00:15:26.675,"Oh, no, this is Shrimpo, my new boyfriend."
00:15:26.759,00:15:28.761,I was just trying to tell you that I moved on.
00:15:28.844,00:15:30.137,"No hard feelings, bud."
00:15:30.846,00:15:34.892,"Oh. Of course not, but if you ever wanna throw a ball around sometime..."
00:15:34.975,00:15:46.695,"He doesn't, Well, whip my heinie with a long red viney, you're back!"
00:15:52.284,00:15:54.411,And who's that statuesque sugar stack?
00:15:54.495,00:15:56.956,"Oh, you're a chip off the old block, I see."
00:15:57.039,00:15:59.124,The taste for big dames runs in our family!
00:15:59.208,00:16:02.586,"Yeah, Pops, listen, if you could just kinda geezer down for a moment..."
00:16:02.670,00:16:04.588,"Sorry, we need to have a talk."
00:16:04.672,00:16:06.215,Let me just check on my friends.
00:16:07.716,00:16:08.884,"Okay, they're fine."
00:16:12.054,00:16:13.931,What kinda candy cigarette is this?
00:16:14.431,00:16:15.683,Twinkletown Giggle Bud.
00:16:16.934,00:16:18.936,"Pops, I need to know the truth."
00:16:19.019,00:16:20.729,Am I not a real elf?
00:16:20.813,00:16:25.192,"Oh, my boy. I've been meaning to... But the thing is, I..."
00:16:25.275,00:16:26.527,"So, you see..."
00:16:26.610,00:16:28.570,"Well, I'm glad we had this talk."
00:16:28.654,00:16:30.114,How 'bout you talk now?
00:16:30.197,00:16:32.741,But you haven't said anything yet.
00:16:32.825,00:16:36.578,"I'm down to my second-to-last emergency flask, so let's have a toast."
00:16:36.662,00:16:39.248,You've opened up your gates and your hearts.
00:16:56.807,00:16:57.808,You followed us?
00:16:57.891,00:17:03.147,It wasn't hard with a trail of heavy bootprints and the tell-tale odor of Dreamland ditch weed.
00:17:03.230,00:17:05.524,The king of Dreamland requires elf blood.
00:17:05.607,00:17:09.319,"If three of the juiciest of you would hop into my sack, we'll be on our way."
00:17:09.403,00:17:11.071,I look like an elf.
00:17:11.155,00:17:13.574,"Come on, Dad. What am I?"
00:17:13.657,00:17:17.786,"Well, I was waiting to tell you until after I was dead, so I wouldn't have to tell you."
00:17:17.870,00:17:22.374,"It's hard to say, so, I'll let this needlepoint do the talking for me."
00:17:22.458,00:17:24.084,Your mom made it.
00:17:24.168,00:17:37.431,"Truth is, you're only half-elf. You're also half-- How dare you threaten these innocent folk?"
00:17:37.514,00:17:39.058,"I mean, look at this guy."
00:17:39.141,00:17:40.726,"Show him what's under your hat, buddy."
00:17:44.271,00:17:46.565,These guys are totally defenseless.
00:17:54.281,00:17:56.283,Get those little bastards.
00:17:56.366,00:17:59.161,"And help me up, I'm beetle-ing."
00:18:09.129,00:18:10.923,Sound the battle bell!
00:18:55.509,00:18:56.844,Ow.
00:18:56.927,00:18:58.804,What happened to my bravest man?
00:18:58.887,00:19:02.432,Edgar the Fearless is now Edgar the Headless.
00:19:11.066,00:19:15.571,You think you can defeat the entire elf kingdom with six knights? Ha!
00:19:17.406,00:19:20.325,"Five, six, seven... Oh, nuts."
00:19:20.409,00:19:23.787,We need to disappear! Close the gates!
00:19:24.538,00:19:27.624,It won't close. The big girl broke it!
00:19:27.708,00:19:29.751,We can't vanish with the door open!
00:19:29.835,00:19:31.795,It would defy the laws of physics.
00:19:31.879,00:19:33.797,We can try and close it from the outside.
00:19:34.590,00:19:38.302,"By order of your father, you will stand aside, Tiabeanie!"
00:19:38.385,00:19:42.973,"Hey, nobody calls me Tiabeanie except my best friends and my worst enemies."
00:20:12.544,00:20:13.712,You did it!
00:20:13.795,00:20:15.505,"No, we did it."
00:20:15.589,00:20:18.634,"Ah, screw team spirit. Those elves stole my stash."
00:20:18.717,00:20:20.135,We are a team.
00:20:20.219,00:20:21.386,I always thought so.
00:20:23.347,00:20:24.640,No! Elfo!
00:20:28.227,00:20:29.311,Who did that?
00:20:31.521,00:20:34.024,"Now, just keep holding on, okay? Just keep holding on."
00:20:38.237,00:20:39.404,"It's okay, Bean."
00:20:40.322,00:20:43.033,I always wanted to go out while I'm still young and hot.
00:20:44.326,00:20:46.703,Your dad's got the immortality thing all wrong.
00:20:47.287,00:20:49.748,That monster is not my dad anymore.
00:20:49.831,00:20:51.250,You're all I've got!
00:20:51.333,00:20:53.293,"Please, stay with me."
00:20:54.169,00:20:56.088,"Elfo, stay with me."
00:21:12.562,00:21:18.068,"Oh, man, if this is sadness, I don't like it one bit."
00:21:18.652,00:21:20.988,"Princess, it's time to go."
00:21:26.743,00:21:29.830,We must relay a message to the king that the mission has failed.
00:21:29.913,00:21:31.957,We didn't get a single elf.
00:21:32.040,00:21:33.875,"A real elf, that is."
00:21:34.960,00:21:36.128,Send a turkey.
00:22:10.245,00:22:14.916,"Aw, Beanie. If there's anything I can do-- Don't touch me."
00:22:15.000,00:22:17.002,Nothing you can do can fix this.
00:22:17.085,00:22:19.671,Elfo is dead because of you.
00:22:20.422,00:22:22.924,Maybe I did go a tad overboard.
00:22:23.008,00:22:27.387,"Your fanatical obsession with the Elixir of Life, was it worth all of this?"
00:22:27.471,00:22:30.807,I don't even think it's real. It's just some myth in a book.
00:22:33.560,00:22:36.313,"It's unfortunate you lost your friend, Beanie."
00:22:36.396,00:22:38.774,I didn't just lose my best friend.
00:22:38.857,00:22:40.275,I lost my father.
00:22:40.359,00:22:43.153,You lied to me and betrayed me. Get out!
00:22:44.863,00:22:46.907,You're right. I did lie to you.
00:22:47.532,00:22:50.786,"The Elixir of Life, it wasn't for me."
00:22:50.869,00:22:52.579,It was for your mother.
00:22:52.662,00:22:54.748,I was trying to bring her back.
00:22:58.043,00:23:00.504,Mom's been dead for 15 years!
00:23:00.587,00:23:03.507,There's nothing left of her. Stop trying to manipulate me.
00:23:03.590,00:23:05.926,This is your mother.
00:23:09.805,00:23:13.392,"That fateful night, the taster, he was late."
00:23:17.020,00:23:18.939,You were such a little monkey.
00:23:19.022,00:23:23.318,"You were switching our cups back and forth, and I didn't know."
00:23:23.402,00:23:27.989,"The cursed poison that was meant for me, she drank it instead."
00:23:35.288,00:23:36.289,Bean?
00:23:42.045,00:23:48.760,"I didn't want to tell you because I'm terrified of female emotions, and I didn't want you to feel guilty."
00:23:48.844,00:23:54.641,"So, I've been grasping at straws, trying to find a way to bring your mother back ever since."
00:23:54.724,00:23:57.310,"But now, it's all a pipe dream."
00:23:58.478,00:24:00.730,"I'm sorry, Bean, for everything."
00:24:02.190,00:24:04.317,I'll let you be alone.
00:24:04.401,00:24:07.696,"And whenever you're ready, we'll get you a new pet."
00:24:12.576,00:24:14.202,God damn.
00:24:14.286,00:24:18.081,"Well, hey, good thing is, I swiped the only thing he cares about."
00:24:18.165,00:24:20.709,"That's gotta make you feel a little better, right?"
00:24:20.792,00:24:21.668,Bean?
00:24:22.335,00:24:26.214,"So, I'm responsible for my own mother's death, too?"
00:24:26.298,00:24:27.591,Am I a bad person?
00:24:28.175,00:24:30.969,"I'm so sorry, Mom."
00:24:31.636,00:24:33.096,I wish you were here.
00:24:38.018,00:24:41.771,"Sorry, it's just... You have snot, like, all over your face."
00:24:41.855,00:24:43.690,"Thanks, yeah."
00:24:46.860,00:24:48.195,This is elf's blood.
00:24:48.695,00:24:50.155,Real elf's blood.
00:24:50.238,00:24:52.365,"You don't think it'd actually work, do you?"
00:24:52.949,00:24:57.662,"No, probably not. But I guess it doesn't hurt to try."
00:25:16.264,00:25:19.643,There's only one drop of blood. I don't know who to choose.
00:25:19.726,00:25:22.979,I don't want to get your hopes up. It'll probably fizzle out like before.
00:25:23.063,00:25:25.565,"So, just close your eyes and don't think too much."
00:25:36.409,00:25:38.245,"Whatever happens, happens."
00:26:04.271,00:26:05.564,Mom?
00:26:08.066,00:26:09.317,What?
00:26:09.401,00:26:11.653,Bean? Bean?
00:26:11.736,00:26:13.321,"Is that you, Bean?"
00:00:28.069,00:00:30.155,"Bean, it's really you."
00:00:30.238,00:00:33.658,"Yes, Mom, it's... it's me. I grew."
00:00:33.742,00:00:35.201,Mostly my teeth.
00:00:35.285,00:00:37.996,You... You were turned to stone.
00:00:38.079,00:00:41.708,"My God! And you freed me? Bean, I..."
00:00:44.294,00:00:46.671,I... I can't believe you're back.
00:00:46.755,00:00:48.590,This is all so crazy.
00:00:52.719,00:00:55.138,I had to choose between...
00:00:57.724,00:01:01.644,"Oh, there, there. Don't cry, darling. Mommy's here now."
00:01:02.771,00:01:04.898,Wow. I feel better already.
00:01:04.981,00:01:06.232,What do you call this?
00:01:06.316,00:01:07.734,Affection.
00:01:16.159,00:01:17.911,Hey. Who goes there?
00:01:21.581,00:01:23.333,"Oi, you havin' a bit of a laugh?"
00:01:23.416,00:01:27.128,"Princess Bean is always drunk at this hour, and you ain't even slurring!"
00:01:29.506,00:01:31.049,She's been dead for years.
00:01:31.132,00:01:35.345,"No, but I haven't eaten in over a decade, so hurry up and open the gate."
00:01:40.517,00:01:43.770,I deserve this fate for doubting you!
00:01:55.031,00:01:59.077,"Ah, that unforgettable stench of manure and boiling cabbage."
00:01:59.160,00:02:00.161,There's cabbage?
00:02:04.916,00:02:06.543,Is it really you?
00:02:07.544,00:02:09.963,"Bunty. Still adorably dim, I see."
00:02:10.046,00:02:12.215,"Dim as the day is long, Your Majesty."
00:02:12.298,00:02:14.342,"Stop poking the royal tit, dear."
00:02:17.011,00:02:18.888,"Sorcerio, Odval."
00:02:18.972,00:02:21.182,I can't believe my eyes.
00:02:23.059,00:02:26.104,Dad! Dad! You're not gonna believe this! Open up!
00:02:28.898,00:02:32.110,Whoa! Holy mother of Bean.
00:02:32.193,00:02:33.695,Is it really you?
00:02:33.778,00:02:35.697,Why don't you kiss me and find out?
00:02:35.780,00:02:36.823,Whoa.
00:02:40.660,00:02:43.913,I've been dreaming of this moment for 15 years.
00:02:43.997,00:02:46.749,Look at you. You haven't changed a bit.
00:02:48.418,00:02:50.712,And you. You've only got bigger...
00:02:53.798,00:02:58.178,"I was so sad about losin' ya, I turned to food for solace."
00:02:58.261,00:02:59.637,But you're back!
00:02:59.721,00:03:01.514,Let's throw a huge feast!
00:03:03.725,00:03:06.311,I'll arrange for something small and tasteful.
00:03:19.157,00:03:20.116,Incredible.
00:03:20.200,00:03:23.828,All that malarkey with the magic elf blood actually paid off.
00:03:23.912,00:03:26.581,"It took all season, but it did."
00:03:26.664,00:03:30.585,"And by season, I mean fall or summer, or whatever this is."
00:03:32.462,00:03:42.138,"Returning to the court for the first time in 15 years, once a statue, now statuesque, it's the dagmarvelous Dagmar!"
00:03:44.724,00:03:46.559,The long wait is over.
00:03:46.643,00:03:48.937,Your wonderful queen has arrived.
00:03:49.020,00:03:51.856,"Aw, aren't you sweet, darling?"
00:03:53.524,00:03:56.152,Thank you for your kind gasps.
00:03:58.363,00:04:02.408,"Uh, ladies, it's gonna be okay."
00:04:02.492,00:04:05.119,"Odval, explain how it's gonna be okay."
00:04:05.203,00:04:07.705,I'll begin with an introduction.
00:04:07.789,00:04:11.668,"Queen Oona of Dreamland, meet Queen Dagmar..."
00:04:11.751,00:04:13.586,Also of Dreamland.
00:04:13.670,00:04:15.630,The cotton candy shop called.
00:04:15.713,00:04:17.215,They want their hair back.
00:04:19.175,00:04:22.804,"Really, I only married her to get the canal built."
00:04:22.887,00:04:24.013,How practical.
00:04:24.097,00:04:25.974,"Yeah, real practical."
00:04:26.057,00:04:29.769,"She also gave me a son, so now, I finally got an heir to the throne!"
00:04:29.852,00:04:31.229,Also practical.
00:04:31.312,00:04:35.441,And you allowed that amphibian to raise my precious Tiabeanie?
00:04:35.525,00:04:38.319,"No, no, no. I was mostly raised by Bunty."
00:04:38.403,00:04:40.280,And a bunch of friendly drunks down at the pub.
00:04:40.363,00:04:42.448,They taught me the fine art of stabbing.
00:04:42.532,00:04:45.368,"Believe me, I kept her on the straight and narrow."
00:04:45.451,00:04:46.995,"Uh, when I had time."
00:04:47.078,00:04:49.289,Dad tried for years to find the Elixir of Life.
00:04:49.372,00:04:51.457,We searched the entire world.
00:04:54.002,00:04:56.587,"Yeah, like Elfo, my best friend."
00:04:56.671,00:05:00.341,"Aw, that sweet, poor little bastard with the funny head."
00:05:00.425,00:05:01.467,I'm gonna miss him.
00:05:01.551,00:05:04.887,Sounds to me like he deserves a marvelous funeral.
00:05:04.971,00:05:06.014,Great idea.
00:05:06.097,00:05:08.599,I'll get someone to fish him out of the corpse pit.
00:05:31.956,00:05:35.001,"You know, I'm gonna miss that Elfo."
00:05:35.084,00:05:37.545,He watered my plants while I was in rehab.
00:05:45.428,00:05:47.805,"Hey, Tess, what happened to your eye?"
00:05:47.889,00:05:49.557,"Oh, I had to stop using the eye."
00:05:49.640,00:05:52.268,It's just too painful seeing the truth all the time.
00:05:52.352,00:05:55.271,"Ah, that's why humans tend to avoid it."
00:05:59.650,00:06:01.694,The procession left without me.
00:06:01.778,00:06:03.696,"Oh, that's too bad."
00:06:03.780,00:06:06.616,I blame myself 'cause I didn't even notice.
00:06:06.699,00:06:09.702,The queen's place is at the side of the king.
00:06:09.786,00:06:13.414,"Oh, Queen Oona. Of course. This is terribly awkward."
00:06:13.498,00:06:17.293,"Please, take my spot. I'll find another place to sit."
00:06:17.877,00:06:19.420,"Mmm, that's better."
00:06:21.047,00:06:23.758,"Yeah, sure. Both of yas with me."
00:06:23.841,00:06:25.885,Plenty of Zog to go around.
00:06:26.844,00:06:29.013,"Beanie, make with the eulogy already."
00:06:31.516,00:06:38.564,"Elfo and I had only been friends for a few months, but they really were the best months of my life."
00:06:38.648,00:06:43.236,Even though much of his time was spent as the subject of barbaric medical experiments...
00:06:43.319,00:06:45.154,She's talking about me.
00:06:45.238,00:06:47.907,...he changed the way I looked at things.
00:06:47.990,00:06:55.832,"In a kingdom of talking cats and enchanted pigs and hooker fairies, Elfo grounded me in reality."
00:06:56.416,00:06:59.419,"I'm really, really going to miss him."
00:07:05.007,00:07:06.551,"Rest in peace, buddy."
00:07:06.634,00:07:09.053,Sorry they had to bury you in this aquarium.
00:07:20.398,00:07:23.734,"Sorry, Queen Oona. I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers."
00:07:23.818,00:07:28.656,"For the last time, they are not feathers. I am not bird-type!"
00:07:30.324,00:07:32.118,You will respect me!
00:07:35.246,00:07:37.081,How dare you!
00:07:45.214,00:07:47.216,"Your Highness, do something."
00:07:47.300,00:07:49.427,"Ladies, ladies! Come on!"
00:08:12.909,00:08:14.410,Elfo! No!
00:08:14.494,00:08:16.621,"There, there. He's with the crabs now."
00:08:22.460,00:08:24.545,"Mom! Oh, my God, are you okay?"
00:08:25.254,00:08:27.465,"You know what, Oona? You're insane!"
00:08:27.548,00:08:29.217,Why don't you just get out of here?
00:08:36.349,00:08:40.186,Ha! I foresee trouble in someone's future.
00:08:40.269,00:08:42.563,"You're going to have to choose, sire."
00:08:42.647,00:08:44.857,You can't have two queens.
00:08:48.694,00:08:50.655,Dagmar is the love of my life.
00:08:50.738,00:08:54.784,"And Queen Oona is the mother of Derek, the heir to the throne."
00:08:54.867,00:08:58.120,"Oh, nonetheless, she is quite unpopular in the kingdom."
00:08:58.204,00:09:01.624,We've gotten dozens of complaints about her late-night howling.
00:09:01.707,00:09:05.044,"If we disgrace Oona, it could mean war with Dankmire."
00:09:05.127,00:09:07.964,Queen Oona has outlived her usefulness.
00:09:08.047,00:09:12.301,I don't think anyone would care if she were to vanish.
00:09:15.137,00:09:18.099,We will see who is going to vanish.
00:09:21.727,00:09:26.983,"I had Odval clear my schedule, so we got the whole night to ourselves."
00:09:27.066,00:09:28.901,"Oh, darling. So ambitious."
00:09:32.530,00:09:34.323,"Bean, you poor baby!"
00:09:34.407,00:09:36.617,What a horrific day you've had.
00:09:36.701,00:09:39.328,Let's have too much wine and forget about it all.
00:09:39.412,00:09:42.373,"Hey, I thought we were gonna have wine and forget stuff."
00:09:42.456,00:09:43.916,"Dad, come on!"
00:09:44.000,00:09:49.005,This is my first chance to have a conversation with a parent without half of it being muttered under their breath.
00:09:58.931,00:10:02.184,I can't believe I'm reduced to talking to you.
00:10:02.268,00:10:04.895,"Hey, the feeling is mutual, but here we are."
00:10:04.979,00:10:07.148,"So, how did you... Oona!"
00:10:12.361,00:10:16.365,"Damn. Well, it's gonna be another long, lonely night."
00:10:16.449,00:10:18.034,"Good night, Vip. Good night, Vap."
00:10:25.333,00:10:28.961,"Ooh, silly me. It's just a statue of Pendergast..."
00:10:29.045,00:10:30.796,that I've never seen before.
00:10:30.880,00:10:34.759,Sculpted in a bizarre and unlikely pose. Huh.
00:10:44.101,00:10:48.814,"All your favorites: poached dodo eggs, unicorn bacon and waffles."
00:10:48.898,00:10:51.442,"How thoughtful, but Bean and I are going riding."
00:10:58.032,00:11:00.159,"Wub you, snuggums!"
00:11:01.452,00:11:04.038,"Ugh, have some dignity, man."
00:11:04.121,00:11:06.749,"You're the king, not some lovelorn old fool."
00:11:06.832,00:11:08.250,How did you get like this?
00:11:08.334,00:11:09.710,You really wanna know?
00:11:09.794,00:11:13.589,"Then pour a drink, light a cigar and hand 'em both to me."
00:11:14.465,00:11:17.760,I was known as Zog the Warrior Prince.
00:11:19.804,00:11:20.805,Had enough?
00:11:34.026,00:11:36.612,"Fighting, competing, winning."
00:11:36.696,00:11:38.572,That was all I wanted to do...
00:11:47.790,00:11:53.796,"A noble's daughter from a far-off land, and she was all I'd ever wanted."
00:11:53.879,00:12:02.722,"Our life together was perfect, and it only got perfecter She's got her father's nose."
00:12:02.805,00:12:04.140,Nice grip.
00:12:06.976,00:12:15.901,"After my brother was poisoned, I'd been so careful, but as time went on, I was so happy, I just sorta forgot."
00:12:15.985,00:12:19.989,"I'm afraid the taster is late, sire, but I've brought up a bottle from the cellar."
00:12:20.072,00:12:21.657,The seal is unbroken.
00:12:32.877,00:12:35.963,"God knows, as my daughter, you'll have plenty when you're older."
00:12:36.589,00:12:38.257,"Come, Zoggy. Make a toast."
00:12:38.340,00:12:39.341,Gwapes!
00:12:44.221,00:12:46.140,To our little family.
00:12:50.269,00:12:51.687,"No! Oh, no!"
00:12:55.941,00:13:04.909,"The poison had been meant for me, but because Bean had switched the glasses, I lived, and my beloved Dagmar was turned to stone."
00:13:04.992,00:13:07.661,"Now, I poured my heart out to you."
00:13:07.745,00:13:10.790,"You tell me, how'd you get to be a talking cat?"
00:13:19.632,00:13:23.052,"This is where I come to clear my head, or to sleep it off."
00:13:26.472,00:13:27.473,You know this place?
00:13:27.556,00:13:30.518,I used to come here when I needed a minute for myself.
00:13:30.601,00:13:33.312,"Your father, bless him, but his voice does carry."
00:13:35.940,00:13:37.650,Tell me something else that you like.
00:13:37.733,00:13:41.237,"-Well, I love the smell of wet grass. -Me, too!"
00:13:43.405,00:13:45.407,"All right, favorite food on three."
00:13:45.491,00:13:47.368,"One, two, three."
00:13:47.451,00:13:48.452,-Beer! -Beer!
00:13:48.536,00:13:51.247,"-Oh, my baby. Are you thirsty? -Always."
00:13:51.330,00:13:52.540,Off to the pub.
00:13:59.421,00:14:01.257,I fear my days are numbered.
00:14:01.340,00:14:04.844,"We will send a message to Dankmire, of the utmost urgency."
00:14:10.599,00:14:14.436,Not a word of this to anyone. The royal family would not approve.
00:14:14.520,00:14:15.896,Bah! To hell with them!
00:14:16.522,00:14:20.526,Zog will pay. Dagmar will pay! Tiabeanie will pay!
00:14:20.609,00:14:22.653,They will all pay!
00:14:23.153,00:14:25.155,I have to warn the princess.
00:14:30.035,00:14:33.289,"Oh, come on, Martin, you twit. Aim!"
00:14:33.372,00:14:35.332,I love how you already know everyone.
00:14:35.416,00:14:37.376,It's almost like you were never away.
00:14:37.960,00:14:38.794,Almost.
00:14:38.878,00:14:40.588,"I'm sorry I wasn't here for you, Bean."
00:14:40.671,00:14:42.840,I know you've had some difficult years.
00:14:42.923,00:14:44.383,"Bad shot, mate!"
00:14:44.466,00:14:46.176,I'm sure your father tried.
00:14:46.260,00:14:47.595,He got my best friend killed.
00:14:47.678,00:14:49.972,"Yes, well, I said tried."
00:14:50.055,00:14:52.474,"Throw the bloody thing, Wayne!"
00:14:52.558,00:14:57.396,"As I was saying, your father did all he could, but a girl just needs her mother."
00:14:57.479,00:14:58.314,I know.
00:15:01.066,00:15:03.527,I am so glad to have you back.
00:15:03.611,00:15:06.113,"And I'm not going anywhere without you, Bean."
00:15:06.196,00:15:07.364,Remember that.
00:15:24.465,00:15:26.592,I just need... Is... I know...
00:15:26.675,00:15:30.262,"All right, I know you're still in shock that my mom is back."
00:15:30.346,00:15:33.766,"I'm in shock, too. I mean, it is shocking."
00:15:33.849,00:15:35.726,It is shocking.
00:15:35.809,00:15:37.770,"But, hey, hey, hey, Bunts..."
00:15:47.446,00:15:49.239,You know? You know what I mean?
00:15:49.865,00:15:50.699,Bunts?
00:15:51.700,00:15:52.868,What are you doing?
00:15:55.621,00:15:57.748,"Oh, man. Oh, man!"
00:15:57.831,00:15:59.750,You gotta help me! Please!
00:15:59.833,00:16:02.378,"Bunty has been turned to stone, and I just..."
00:16:02.461,00:16:04.171,"Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
00:16:13.097,00:16:15.808,We have to do something. Now!
00:16:15.891,00:16:17.643,Any one of us could be next.
00:16:17.726,00:16:20.270,Women aren't permitted to address the council.
00:16:20.354,00:16:22.231,But you're the only one in here!
00:16:22.314,00:16:23.565,Then it's unanimous.
00:16:23.649,00:16:25.234,"Shut up, will ya?"
00:16:25.317,00:16:28.737,"Ah, I should've done something earlier, but now, I got no choice."
00:16:28.821,00:16:30.489,I have to take action.
00:16:30.572,00:16:31.865,I hate action!
00:16:31.949,00:16:33.575,"But against whom, sire?"
00:16:33.659,00:16:34.910,It's gotta be Oona.
00:16:34.994,00:16:38.288,She's finally snapped after years of us being dicks to her.
00:16:38.372,00:16:42.876,Any attack against Queen Oona would be seen as an act of war on Dankmire.
00:16:42.960,00:16:46.255,A war you'd have to fight with most of your cabinet turned to stone.
00:16:46.338,00:16:49.049,Zog was the greatest warrior Dreamland has ever seen.
00:16:49.133,00:16:51.260,You dare question his fitness for battle?
00:16:51.343,00:16:52.302,Not at all.
00:16:52.386,00:16:56.932,Only the wisdom of proceeding without a strategy for-- My clothes are really heavy.
00:16:57.016,00:16:59.601,Can we have this conversation sitting down?
00:17:02.438,00:17:05.232,"Zoggy, you have to. Before she comes after one of us."
00:17:05.315,00:17:08.610,We can't let our family be ripped apart again.
00:17:13.824,00:17:15.743,"Why, certainly, my good man."
00:17:17.202,00:17:20.706,Father! To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?
00:17:20.789,00:17:22.916,"So, listen, son."
00:17:23.000,00:17:27.212,"Your mother and I, we've been having some, um..."
00:17:27.296,00:17:32.760,"difficulties lately, and I'd like to lock you in the tower until we sort things out."
00:17:32.843,00:17:35.387,All right. But you'll come get me later?
00:17:35.471,00:17:39.641,"Sure. Once we work things out, whoever survives will come and get you."
00:17:39.725,00:17:43.645,"Okay, but I'm still having nightmares about that big skillet."
00:17:46.273,00:17:48.776,I'm afraid we made the mistake of trusting her.
00:17:48.859,00:17:51.445,She could get any of us at any moment.
00:17:51.528,00:17:53.405,We gotta split up and search for her.
00:17:53.489,00:17:55.699,"Hmm, I have a better idea."
00:17:56.325,00:17:58.869,"Go ahead, sire. Don't ask about my fourth eye!"
00:17:59.495,00:18:03.916,"Almighty ball, is Oona still in Dreamland?"
00:18:07.002,00:18:09.379,"Wait, its answers are often cryptic."
00:18:09.463,00:18:11.840,Is Queen Oona in the castle?
00:18:12.758,00:18:14.802,The danger is near.
00:18:15.302,00:18:16.261,Let me try.
00:18:16.345,00:18:21.100,Where is-- Enough! No more time for parlor tricks.
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.602,We've got to protect ourselves. I'll watch Bean.
00:18:23.685,00:18:25.270,And we'll track down Oona.
00:18:25.354,00:18:31.735,I'll use my skills as a hunter and Odval will use his diplomacy to stab her with a broom handle.
00:18:36.949,00:18:39.409,"Follow me, darling. We'll be completely safe up here."
00:18:39.993,00:18:42.830,Wow. Does Dad even know about this room?
00:18:42.913,00:18:44.665,No. It's called the library.
00:18:51.797,00:18:54.675,"Huh. So, what was going on here?"
00:18:55.926,00:18:57.010,Neat trick.
00:18:58.262,00:18:59.388,Then what happened?
00:19:02.099,00:19:07.354,Let me try. Where is-- Whoa.
00:19:07.437,00:19:09.606,Can we try running it back a little further?
00:19:09.690,00:19:12.276,"Actually, a lot further?"
00:19:21.785,00:19:24.663,You can rest easy now and get some fresh air.
00:19:24.746,00:19:29.501,"I used to spend many nights up here, watching the stars, the moon, the neighbors."
00:19:29.585,00:19:32.921,"Mom? That's never happened before, the thing with my fingers..."
00:19:33.005,00:19:36.341,"As you reach maturity, you will notice many more changes."
00:19:36.425,00:19:39.094,Duh. I already know.
00:19:39.178,00:19:40.596,This isn't a sex talk.
00:19:41.180,00:19:43.682,Oh. What kind of talk is it?
00:19:43.765,00:19:46.935,"There are some things you need to know about yourself, Bean."
00:20:10.417,00:20:11.251,"Oh, my!"
00:20:31.355,00:20:32.814,"Quick, Odval, stab her in the neck!"
00:20:35.359,00:20:37.861,I've got something real for you to freak out about.
00:20:38.862,00:20:43.992,"Dude, the truth has been right under your nose the whole time, but you were too in love to see it."
00:20:44.076,00:20:45.452,Show us what happened here.
00:20:45.994,00:20:48.372,"Okay, now let's take it back about 15 years."
00:20:56.421,00:20:58.173,To our little family.
00:21:03.804,00:21:05.097,"No! Oh, no!"
00:21:09.142,00:21:10.185,Incredible.
00:21:10.269,00:21:12.229,It's exactly as I remembered it.
00:21:12.312,00:21:15.274,"Except, this time, watch from over here."
00:21:19.903,00:21:21.655,The seal is unbroken.
00:21:31.415,00:21:32.416,Dagmar?
00:21:32.499,00:21:34.459,She poisoned the wine?
00:21:34.543,00:21:41.925,"But if Bean hadn't switched the glasses around, I'd be-- Uh-huh. Out there in the garden with pigeons crapping on your head."
00:21:43.093,00:21:45.971,But I devoted my life to her. I...
00:21:46.972,00:21:48.265,How could she?
00:21:48.348,00:21:51.727,"Looks like she's been keeping quite a few secrets from you, my man."
00:22:00.027,00:22:02.529,I want you as you were born to be.
00:22:02.612,00:22:05.657,What was I born to be? Mom?
00:22:05.741,00:22:09.328,Damn small print. This had better be the right one.
00:22:12.664,00:22:13.498,Oh!
00:22:22.924,00:22:25.385,The only woman I ever loved.
00:22:25.469,00:22:29.598,Do you know what I did for you? What I gave up to get you back?
00:22:44.363,00:22:46.281,"This goes way beyond you and me, dear."
00:22:46.365,00:22:49.951,It is a dark battle of a hundred centuries and our daughter's destiny.
00:22:50.035,00:22:51.745,Not if I can help it.
00:22:55.665,00:22:56.583,Come on!
00:23:18.563,00:23:21.191,Huh? What is that? Goo?
00:23:24.361,00:23:25.195,Yikes!
00:23:28.949,00:23:31.993,Summon the army! This kingdom is under attack!
00:23:32.077,00:23:36.998,By a ruthless enemy who will stop at nothing. My wife!
00:23:46.591,00:23:48.093,What? Whose attack?
00:23:48.176,00:23:52.097,I'm afraid it's Oona. She is coming for us. For you.
00:23:52.180,00:23:53.348,For me?
00:23:53.432,00:23:56.768,"You, and you alone, are the key to the future of this kingdom."
00:23:56.852,00:23:58.270,All you need is my guidance.
00:24:01.273,00:24:03.442,"Sire, we've rallied the troops."
00:24:05.777,00:24:06.611,From what?
00:24:13.452,00:24:15.287,I should be the one killing everyone.
00:24:15.370,00:24:17.164,I should be the one creeping everyone out.
00:24:34.556,00:24:36.683,"I know, sweetie. This way."
00:24:36.766,00:24:40.145,"What did you mean when you said, The future of this kingdom?"
00:24:40.228,00:24:42.564,Are you saying I'm some kind of hero?
00:24:42.647,00:24:45.525,"They're such relative terms, aren't they, darling?"
00:24:45.609,00:24:48.111,Hero and villain? One step up.
00:24:57.120,00:24:58.872,"Mom, what did you do that for?"
00:24:58.955,00:25:02.000,It was the only way to get you to stop talking. Now swim for that ship.
00:25:11.510,00:25:14.971,"Welcome aboard, Queen Dagmar and Princess Tiabeanie."
00:25:15.055,00:25:18.683,"Mom, what are these creatures, and why are they looking at me that way?"
00:25:18.767,00:25:23.438,"Bean, you have so much to learn and many wonderful things to see."
00:25:23.522,00:25:27.317,Set sail! For the homeland and a glorious future!
00:25:45.961,00:25:50.549,"I guess the only bright side is, now I got nothing left to lose."
00:25:53.843,00:25:57.347,Except the thing that says I'm a king!
00:25:57.514,00:26:00.183,"Ah, come on!"
