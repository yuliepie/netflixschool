"Easy, boy."
"What do you expect?"
"They’re savages."
"One lot steals a goat from another lot, before you know it they’re ripping each other to pieces."
"I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."
"How close did you get?"
"Close as any man would."
"We should head back to the Wall."
"Do the dead frighten you?"
"Our orders were to track the wildlings."
"We tracked them."
"They won’t trouble us no more."
"You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died?"
"Get back on your horse."
"Whatever did it to them could do it to us."
"They even killed the children."
"It’s a good thing we’re not children."
"You want to run away south, run away."
"Of course, they will behead you as a deserter."
"If I don’t catch you first."
"Get back on your horse."
"I won’t say it again."
"Your dead men seem to have moved camp."
"They were here."
"See where they went."
"What is it?"
"It’s…"
"Go on, Father’s watching."
"And your mother."
"Fine work, as always."
"Well done."
"Thank you."
"I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in these corners."
"Quite beautiful."
"The stitching…"
"Oh, no, no, no."
"This stitch is very…"
"It’s beautiful."
"Thank you."
"And which one of you was a marksman at ten?"
"Keep practicing, Bran."
"Go on."
"Don’t think too much, Bran."
"Relax your bow arm."
"Quick, Bran!"
"Faster."
"Lord Stark!"
"My lady."
"A guardsman just rode in from the hills."
"They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch."
"Get the lads to saddle their horses."
"Do you have to?"
"He swore an oath, Cat."
"Law is law, my lady."
"Tell Bran he’s coming too."
"Ned."
"Ten is too young to see such things."
"He won’t be a boy forever."
"And winter is coming."
"Good lad, go run back and get the rest."
"White walkers."
"I saw the white walkers."
"White walkers."
"The white walkers, I saw them."
"I know I broke my oath."
"And I know I’m a deserter."
"I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them, but…"
"I saw what I saw."
"I saw the white walkers."
"People need to know."
"If you can get word to my family…"
"tell them I’m no coward."
"Tell them I’m sorry."
"Forgive me, Lord."
"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name…"
"Don’t look away…"
"."
"King of the Andals and the First Men…"
"Father will know if you do…"
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die."
"You did well."
"You understand why I did it?"
"Jon said he was a deserter."
"But do you understand why I had to kill him?"
"“Our way is the old way”?"
"The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword."
"Is it true he saw the white walkers?"
"The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years."
"So he was lying?"
"A madman sees what he sees."
"What is it?"
"Mountain lion?"
"There are no mountain lions in these woods."
"It’s a freak."
"It’s a direwolf."
"Tough old beast."
"There are no direwolves south of the Wall."
"Now there are five."
"You want to hold it?"
"Where will they go?"
"Their mother’s dead."
"They don’t belong down here."
"Better a quick death."
"They won’t last without their mother."
"Right."
"Give it here."
"No!"
"Put away your blade."
"I take orders from your father, not you."
"Please, Father!"
"I’m sorry, Bran."
"Lord Stark?"
"There are five pups."
"One for each of the Stark children."
"The direwolf is the sigil of your house."
"They were meant to have them."
"You will train them yourselves."
"You will feed them yourselves."
"And if they die, you will bury them yourselves."
"What about you?"
"I’m not a Stark."
"Get on."
"What is it?"
"The runt of the litter."
"That one’s yours, Snow."
"As your brother,I feel it’s my duty to warn you…"
"you worry too much."
"It’s starting to show."
"And you never worry about anything."
"When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock, foot drop into the water…"
"you were never afraid."
"There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father."
"“We’re Lannisters."
"Lannisters don’t act like fools."
"” What if Jon Arryn told someone?"
"But who would he tell?"
"My husband."
"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now."
"Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him."
"And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores."
"Or is it the other way around?"
"And life will go on."
"You should be the Hand of the King."
"That’s an honour I can do without."
"Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
"All these years, and I still feel like an outsider when I come here."
"You have five northern children."
"You’re not an outsider."
"I wonder if the old gods agree."
"It’s your gods with all the rules."
"I am so sorry, my love."
"Tell me."
"There was a raven from King’s Landing."
"Jon Arryn is dead."
"A fever took him."
"I know he was like a father to you."
"Your sister, the boy?"
"They both have their health, gods be good."
"The raven brought more news."
"The king rides for Winterfell…"
"with the queen and all the rest of them."
"If he’s coming this far north…"
"there’s only one thing he’s after."
"You can always say no, Ned."
"We’ll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber."
"I’m told he reads all night."
"I’m told he drinks all night."
"How much could he possibly drink?"
"A man of his…"
"stature?"
"We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar."
"Perhaps we’ll find out."
"In any case, candles."
"Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king?"
"It’s for the queen, I bet."
"I hear she’s a sleek bit of mink."
"I hear the prince is a right royal prick."
"Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick."
"Go on, Tommy, shear him good."
"He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
"Gods, but they grow fast."
"Brandon!"
"I saw the king."
"He’s got hundreds of people."
"How many times have I told you?"
"No climbing."
"But he’s coming right now, down our road."
"I want you to promise me, no more climbing."
"I promise."
"Do you know what?"
"What?"
"You always look at your feetbefore you lie."
"Run and find your father."
"Tell him the king is close."
"Where’s Arya?"
"Sansa, where’s your sister?"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
"Oh."
"What are you doing with that on?"
"Go on."
"Move!"
"Your Grace."
"You’ve got fat."
"Cat!"
"Your Grace."
"Nine years…"
"Why haven’t I seen you?"
"Where the hell have you been?"
"Guarding the North for you, Your Grace."
"Winterfell is yours."
"Where’s the Imp?"
"Will you shut up?"
"Who have we here?"
"You must be Robb."
"My, you’re a pretty one."
"Your name is?"
"Arya."
"Oh, show us your muscles."
"You’ll be a soldier."
"That’s Jaime Lannister,the queen’s twin brother."
"Would you please shut up?"
"My queen."
"My queen."
"Take me to your crypt."
"I want to pay my respects."
"We’ve been riding for a month, my love."
"Surely the dead can wait."
"Ned."
"Where’s the Imp?"
"Where is our brother?"
"Go and find the little beast."
"Tell me about Jon Arryn."
"One minute he was fine and then…"
"burned right through him,whatever it was."
"I loved that man."
"We both did."
"He never had to teach you much,but me?"
"You remember me at ?"
"All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls."
"He showed me what was what."
"Aye."
"Don’t look at me like that."
"It’s not his fault I didn’t listen."
"I need you, Ned,down at King’s Landing, not up here where you’re no damn use to anybody."
"Lord Eddard Stark…"
"I would name you the Hand of the King."
"I’m not worthy of the honour."
"I’m not trying to honour you."
"I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave."
"Damn it, Ned, stand up."
"You helped me win the Iron Throne,now help me keep the damn thing."
"We were meant to rule together."
"If your sister had lived,we’d have been bound by blood."
"Well, it’s not too late."
"I have a son,you have a daughter."
"We’ll join our houses."
"It is true what they say about the northern girls."
"Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?"
"I did hear something about that."
"And the queen and her twin brother."
"They say that he is the most handsome manin the Seven Kingdoms."
"And the other brother?"
"The queen has two brothers?"
"There’s the pretty one…"
"and there’s the clever one."
"Mmm…"
"I hear they call him the Imp."
"I hear he hates that nickname."
"Oh?"
"I hear he’s more than earned it."
"I hear he’s a drunken little lecher,prone to all manner of perversions."
"Clever girl."
"We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
"Have you?"
"Already?"
"Oh!"
"The gods gave me one blessing."
"Don’t get up."
"My lord."
"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
"You have much to teach me, no doubt,but our sister craves your attention."
"She has odd cravings, our sister."
"A family trait."
"Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown."
"Don’t leave me alone with these people."
"I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early."
"And this is the first of many courses."
"I thought you might say that."
"But since we’re short on time…"
"Come on, girls."
"See you at sundown."
"Close the door!"
"Did you have to bury her in a place like this?"
"She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her."
"She was my sister."
"This is where she belongs."
"She belonged with me."
"In my dreams,I kill him every night."
"It’s done, Your Grace."
"The Targaryens are gone."
"Not all of them."
"Daenerys!"
"Daenerys."
"There’s our bride to be."
"Look, a gift from Illyrio."
"Touch it."
"Go on, feel the fabric."
"Mmm."
"Isn’t he a gracious host?"
"We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything."
"Illyrio’s no fool."
"He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne."
"You still slouch."
"Let them see."
"You have a woman’s body now."
"I need you to be perfect today."
"Can you do that for me?"
"You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?"
"No."
"When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister,they will say it began today."
"It’s too hot, my lady."
"Where is he?"
"The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality."
"Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven."
"May I present my honoured guests?"
"Viserys of House Targaryen,the third of his name,the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,and his sister,Daenerys of House Targaryen."
"Do you see how long his hair is?"
"When Dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame."
"Khal Drogo has never been defeated."
"He’s a savage, of course,but he’s one of the finest killers alive."
"And you will be his queen."
"Come forward, my dear."
"Where is he going?"
"The ceremony is over."
"But he…"
"But he didn’t say anything."
"Did he like her?"
"Trust me, Your Grace,if he didn’t like her, we’d know."
"It won’t be long now."
"Soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father’s throne."
"The people drink secret toasts to your health."
"They cry out for their true king."
"When will they be married?"
"Soon."
"The Dothraki never stay still for long."
"Is it true they lie with their horses?"
"I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo."
"Do you take me for a fool?"
"I take you for a king."
"Kings lack the caution of common men."
"My apologies if I’ve given offence."
"I know how to play a man like Drogo."
"I give him a queen and he gives me an army."
"I don’t want to be his queen."
"I want to go home."
"So do I."
"I want us both to go home,but they took it from us."
"So tell me, sweet sister,how do we go home?"
"I don’t know."
"We go home with an army."
"With Khal Drogo’s army."
"I would let his whole tribe fuck you,all , men and their horses too,if that’s what it took."
"Do you think Joffrey will like me?"
"What if he thinks I’m ugly?"
"Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived."
"He’s so handsome."
"When would we be married?"
"Soon?"
"Or do we have to wait?"
"Hush now."
"Your father hasn’t even said yes."
"Why would he say no?"
"He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms."
"He’d have to leave home."
"He’d have to leave me."
"And so would you."
"You left your home to come here And I’d be queen someday."
"Please make Father say yes!"
"Sansa…"
"Please, please!"
"It’s the only thing I ever wanted."
"Fill that up!"
"Boys, Rodrik, come on."
"Come on!"
"Come here, you little beauty!"
"Is he dead yet?"
"Uncle Benjen."
"You got bigger."
"Rode all day."
"Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters."
"Why aren’t you at the feast?"
"Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst."
"Well, you’re always welcome on the Wall."
"No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
"So take me with you when you go back."
"Jon…"
"Father will let me if you ask him."
"I know he will."
"The Wall isn’t going anywhere."
"I’m ready to swear your oath."
"You don’t understand what you’d be giving up."
"We have no families."
"None of us will ever father sons."
"I don’t care about that."
"You might, if you knew what it meant."
"I’d better get inside,rescue your father from his guests."
"We’ll talk later."
"Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch."
"What are you doing back there?"
"Preparing for a night with your family."
"I’ve always wanted to see the Wall."
"You’re Tyrion Lannister,the queen’s brother?"
"My greatest accomplishment."
"And you, you’re Ned Stark’s bastard,aren’t you?"
"Did I offend you?"
"Sorry."
"You are the bastard, though."
"Lord Eddard Stark is my father."
"And Lady Stark is not your mother,making you…"
"the bastard."
"Let me give you some advice, bastard."
"Never forget what you are."
"The rest of the world will not."
"Wear it like armour…"
"and it can never be used to hurt you."
"What the hell do you know about being a bastard?"
"All dwarves are bastards in their father’s eyes."
"You at a feast…"
"it’s like a bear in a trap."
"The boy I beheaded…"
"did you know him?"
"Of course I did."
"Just a lad."
"But he was tough, Ned,a true ranger."
"He was talking madness."
"Said the walkers slaughtered his friends."
"The two he was with are still missing."
"Hmph."
"A wildling ambush."
"Maybe."
"Direwolves south of the Wall,talk of the walkers,and my brother might bethe next Hand of the King."
"Winter is coming."
"Winter is coming."
"Uncle Benjen."
"Robb boy."
"How are you?"
"I’m good."
"Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
"Yes."
"Lovely country."
"I’m sure it’s very grim after King’s Landing."
"I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
"Hello, little dove."
"But you are a beauty."
"How old are you?"
"Thirteen, Your Grace."
"You’re tall."
"Still growing?"
"I think so, Your Grace."
"And have you bled yet?"
"No, Your Grace."
"Your dress, did you make it?"
"Such talent."
"You must make something for me."
"I hear we might share a grandchild someday."
"I hear the same."
"Your daughter will do well in the capital."
"Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever."
"Your pardon."
"I hear we might be neighbours soon."
"I hope it’s true."
"Yes, the king has honoured me with his offer."
"I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept."
"It would be good to have you on the field."
"The competition has become a bit stale."
"I don’t fight in tournaments."
"No?"
"Getting a little old for it?"
"I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real,I don’t want him to know what I can do."
"Well said."
"Arya!"
"It’s not funny!"
"She always does this."
"This was my favourite dress and she ruined it."
"She always does it and it’s not funny!"
"Time for bed."
"I’m a Northman."
"I belong here with you, not down southin that rats’ nest they call a capital."
"I won’t let him take you."
"The king takes what he wants."
"That’s why he’s king."
"I’ll say, “Listen, fat man."
"” “You are not taking my husband anywhere."
"” He belongs to me now."
"” How did he get so fat?"
"He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink."
"It’s Maester Luwin, my lord."
"Send him in."
"Pardon, my lord, my lady."
"A rider in the night…"
"from your sister."
"Stay."
"This was sent from the Eyrie."
"What’s she doing at the Eyrie?"
"She hasn’t been back there since her wedding."
"What news?"
"She’s fled the capital."
"She says Jon Arryn was murdered."
"By the Lannisters."
"She says the king is in danger."
"She’s fresh widowed, Cat."
"She doesn’t know what she’s saying."
"Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter."
"Do you think she would risk her life,her son’s life,if she wasn’t certainher husband was murdered?"
"If this news is true…"
"and the Lannisters conspire against the throne,who but you can protect the king?"
"They murdered the last Hand."
"Now you want Ned to take the job?"
"The king rode for a month to ask for Lord Stark’s help."
"He’s the only one he trusts."
"You swore the king an oath, my lord."
"He’s spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars."
"He owes him nothing."
"Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand."
"A different time."
"A different king."
"When do I meet with the khal?"
"We need to begin planning the invasion."
"If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,you shall have it."
"When?"
"When their omens favour war."
"I piss on Dothraki omens."
"I’ve waited years to get my throne back."
"Etayo akka."
"A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair."
"Jadi, zhey Jorah andahli!"
"Khal vezhven."
"A small gift, for the new khaleesi."
"Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms."
"Thank you, ser."
"Are you from my country?"
"Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island."
"I served your father for many years."
"Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
"Dragon’s eggs, Daenerys,from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai."
"The ages have turned them to stone,but they will always be beautiful."
"Thank you, Magister."
"She’s beautiful."
"Ser Jorah, I…"
"I don’t know how to say “thank you”in Dothraki."
"There is no word for “thank you”in Dothraki."
"Make him happy."
"No."
"Do you know the common tongue?"
"No."
"Is “no” the only word that you know?"
"No."
"Rough night, Imp?"
"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other,it’ll be a miracle."
"I didn’t pick you for a hunter."
"The greatest in the land my spear never misses."
"It’s not hunting if you pay for it."
"Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?"
"No, but I’m still better than you."
"I know what I’m putting you through."
"Thank you for saying yes."
"I only ask you because I need you."
"You’re a loyal friend."
"You hear me?"
"A loyal friend."
"The last one I’ve got."
"I hope I’ll serve you well."
"You will."
"And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time."
"Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!"
"Come on, you."
"Stop!"
"Stop."
"Are you completely mad?"
"He saw us."
"It’s all right, it’s all right."
"It’s all right."
"He saw us!"
"I heard you the first time."
"Quite the little climber, aren’t you?"
"How old are you, boy?"
"Ten."
"Ten."
"The things I do for love."
""
"S1E2"
"You need to drink, child."
"And eat."
"Isn’t there anything else."
"The Dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses."
"People can’t live on grass."
"In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night."
"It murders all other grass."
"The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything that’s the way the world will end."
"It’ll get easier."
"Khaleesi."
"Your hands."
"We’re still not far from Pentos,Your Grace."
"Master Illyrio has extended his hospitality."
"You’d be more comfortable there."
"I have no interest in hospitality or comfort."
"I’ll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown."
"As you wish, Your Grace."
"Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is,I suppose it is preferable to beheading."
"What did Ned Stark want you for."
"Buying from a slaver."
"Selling to one."
"Some poachers I caught on my land."
"Under my reign, you won’t be punished for such nonsense."
"You can rest assured of that."
"Better looking bitches than you’re used to, Uncle."
"My mother’s been looking for you."
"We ride for King’s Landing today."
"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
"What good will my sympathies do them."
"None."
"But it is expected of you."
"Your absence has already been noted."
"The boy means nothing to me."
"And I can’t stand the wailing of women."
"One word and I’ll hit you again."
"I’m telling Mother."
"Go."
"Tell her."
"But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are,that you are at their service,and that all your prayers are with them."
"Do you understand."
"You can’t."
"Do you understand."
"The Prince will remember that, little lord."
"I hope so."
"If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him."
"Ah."
"Time for breakfast."
"Bread."
"And two of those little fish."
"And a mug of dark beer to wash it down."
"And bacon, burnt black."
"Hyah."
"Little brother."
"Beloved siblings."
"Is Bran going to die."
"Apparently not."
"What do you mean."
"The maester says the boy may live."
"It’s no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
"Only the gods know for certain."
"All the rest of us can do is pray."
"The charms of the North seem entirely lost on you."
"I still can’t believe you’re going."
"It’s ridiculous, even for you."
"Where’s your sense of wonder."
"The greatest structure ever built,the intrepid men of the Night’s Watch,the wintry abode of the white walkers."
"Tell me you’re not thinking of taking the black."
"And go celibate."
"The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock."
"No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world."
"The children don’t need to hear your filth."
"Come."
"Even if the boy lives,he’ll be a cripple, a grotesque."
"Give me a good, clean death any day."
"Speaking for the grotesques, I’d have to disagree."
"Death is so final, whereas life."
"."
"."
"ah, life is full of possibilities."
"I hope the boy does wake."
"I’d be very interested to hear what he has to say."
"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you’re on."
"My dear brother, you wound me."
"You know how much love my family."
"Please."
"Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace."
"This is your home."
"I’m your guest."
"Handsome one, isn’t he."
"I lost my first boy,a little blackhaired beauty."
"He was a fighter too tried to beat the fever that took him."
"Forgive me."
"It’s the last thing you need to hear right now."
"I never knew."
"It was years ago."
"Robert was crazed,beat his hands bloody on the wall,all the things men do to show you how much they care."
"The boy looked just like him."
"Such a little thing."
"A bird without feathers."
"They came to take his body away and Robert held me."
"I screamed and I battled, but he held me."
"That little bundle."
"They took him away and I never saw him again."
"Never have visited the crypt, never."
"I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
"I am grateful."
"Perhaps this time she’ll listen."
"A sword for the Wall."
"I already have one."
"Good man."
"Have you swung it yet."
"Of course I have."
"At someone, I mean."
"It’s a strange thing,the first time you cut a man."
"You realise we’re nothing but sacks of meat and blood,and some bone to keep it all standing."
"Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall wildlings and white walkers and whatnot."
"We’re grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
"We’ve guarded the Kingdoms for , years."
"Is it “we” already."
"Have you taken your vows, then."

"A present."
"Close the door."
"This is no toy."
"Be careful you don’t cut yourself."
"It’s so skinny."
"So are you."
"I had the blacksmith make it for you special."
"It won’t hack a man’s head off,but it can poke him full of holes if you’re quick enough."
"I can be quick."
"You’ll have to work at it every day."
"How does it feel."
"Do you like the balance."
"I think so."
"First lesson stick them with the pointy end."

"I want you."

"years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon."
"You came back a year later with another woman’s son."
"And now you’re leaving again."

"Good."
"Next time I see you,you’ll be all in black."
"It was always my colour."
"Farewell, Snow."
"And you, Stark."
"There’s great honour serving in the Night’s Watch."
"The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years."
"And you are a Stark."
"You might not have my name,but you have my blood."
"Is my mother alive."
"Does she know about me."
"Where I am, where I’m going."
"Does she care."
"The next time we see each other,we’ll talk about your mother."
"Hmm."
"I promise."
"Gods, this is country."
"I’ve half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
"I’ve half a mind to go with you."
"What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
"You should have asked me years ago."
"There were wars to fight,women to marry we never had the chance to be young."
"I recall a few chances."
"There was that one."
"."

"Oh, what was her name."
"That common girl of yours."
"Becca."

"We were at war."
"None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again."
"You’re too hard on yourself."
"You always have been."
"I swear if I weren’t your king,you’d have hit me already."
"The worst thing about your coronation I’ll never get to hit you again."
"Trust me, that’s not the worst thing."
"There was a rider in the night."
"Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord."
"What of it."
"Do we send her a wedding gift."
"A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,and a bold man to wield it."
"She’s little more than a child."
"Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding."
"Tell me we’re not speaking of this."
"Oh, it’s unspeakable to you."
"What her father did to your family that was unspeakable."
"What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved."
"I’ll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
"But you can’t get your Hands on this one, can you."
"This Khal Drogo,it’s said he has , men in his horde."
"Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm,as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea."
"They have no ships, Robert."
"There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper."
"If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
"He will not cross."
"And if by chance he does,we’ll throw him back into the sea."
"There’s a war coming, Ned."
"I don’t know when,I don’t know who we’ll be fighting,but it’s coming."
"Sit."
"You’ll be fed."
"Untie them."
"Ah, rapers."
"They were given a choice, no doubt castration or the Wall."
"Most choose the knife."
"Not impressed by your new brothers."
"Lovely thing about the Watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one."
"Why do you read so much."
"Look at me and tell me what you see."
"Is this a trick."
"What you see is a dwarf."
"If I’d been born a peasant they might’ve left me out in the woods to die."
"Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock."
"Things are expected of me."
"My father was the Hand of the King for years."
"Until your brother killed that king."
"Yes, until my brother killed him."
"Life is full of these little ironies."
"My sister married the new king, and."

"my repulsive nephew will be king after him."
"I must do my part for the honour of my house."
"Wouldn’t you agree."
"But how."
"Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind,and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone."
"That’s why I read so much, Jon Snow."
"And you."
"What’s your story, bastard."
"Ask me nicely and maybe I’ll tell you, dwarf."
"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,off to join the ancient order of the Night’s Watch,alongside his valiant brothers in arms."

"It’s time we reviewed the accounts, my lady."
"You’ll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
"Talk to Poole about it."
"Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady."
"We need a new steward,and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention."
"I don’t care about appointments."
"I’ll make the appointments."
"We’ll talk about it first thing in the morning."

"No dragon."
"Brave men kill them."
"It is known."
"It is known."
"A trader from Qarth told me that dragons come from the moon."
"The moon."
"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,that once there were two moons in the sky."
"But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat, and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun’s fire."
"Moon is no egg."
"Moon is goddess wife of sun."
"It is known."
"It is known."
"Leave me with her."
"Why did the trader from Qarthtell you these stories."

"Yes."

"Why."
"Why murder an innocent child."
"Unless he saw somethinghe wasn’t meant to see."
"Saw what, my lady."
"I don’t know."
"But I would stake my lifethe Lannisters are involved."
"We already have reason to suspecttheir loyalty to the Crown."
"Did you notice the dagger the killer used."
"It’s too fine a weapon for such a man."

"What about Bran."
"I have prayed to the Sevenfor more than a month."
"Bran’s life is in their hands now."
"No, Khaleesi."
"You must look in his eyes always."

"Finish a man."

"Um, what’s the line?"

"Very handsome armour."
"Not a scratch on it."
"I know."

"You’ve chosen your opponents wisely then."
"I have a knack for it."

"They didn’t deserve to die like that."
"Nobody deserves to die like that."

"No, Lord Stark."
"men and this room was silent as a crypt."
"Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing."
"And later…"
"when I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned…"
"It felt like justice."
"Is that what you tell yourself at night?"
"You’re a servant of justice?"
"That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen’s back?"
"Tell me, if I’d stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
"You served him well…"
"when serving was safe."
"Lord Stark."
"Lord Varys."
"I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad."
"We are all praying for Prince Joffrey’s full recovery."

"I still carry a token of his esteem…"
"from navel to collarbone."
"Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with."
"It wasn’t the man that I chose, my lord."
"It was Catelyn Tully."
"A woman worth fighting for, I’m sure you’ll agree."
"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
"Grand Maester."
"How many years has it been?"
"You were a young man."
"And you served another king."
"Oh, how forgetful of me."
"This belongs to you now."
"Should we begin?"
"Without the king?"
"Winter may be coming, but I’m afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
"His Grace has many cares."
"He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load."
"We are the lords of small matters here."
"My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honour of Lord Stark’s appointment as Hand of the King."
"Mm, how much?"
", gold dragons to the champion, to the runnerup, to the winning archer."
"Can the treasury bear such expense?"
"I’ll have to borrow it."
"The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect."
"We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold."
"What’s another ,?"
"Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?"
"I’m telling you the Crown is six million in debt."
"How could you let this happen?"
"The master of coin finds the money."
"The king and the Hand spend it."
"I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm."
"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn’t always listen."
"“Counting coppers,” he calls it."
"I’ll speak to him tomorrow."
"This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford."

"It’s ugly."

"You fought off a direwolf."
"You’re a warrior like your father."
"I’m not like him."
"I didn’t fight off anything."
"It bit me and all I did was scream."
"And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
"That’s not true."
"You killed the beast."
"You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father."
"I didn’t, I…"
"When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor."
"Someday you’ll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
"Do I have to marry her?"
"Yes."
"She’s very beautiful and young."
"If you don’t like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses."
"And if you’d rather fuck painted whores, you’ll fuck painted whores."
"And if you’d rather lie with noble virgins, so be it."
"You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be."

"I don’t want to."
"No, but you will."
"The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
"We allow the northerners too much power."
"They consider themselves our equals."
"How would you handle them?"
"I’d double their taxes and command them to supply , men to the royal army."
"A royal army?"
"Why should every lord command his own men?"
"It’s primitive, no better than the hill tribes."
"We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers, instead of a mob of peasants who’ve never held pikes in their lives."
"And if the northerners rebel?"
"I’d crush them."
"Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the North."
"Uncle Kevan, maybe."
"And these , northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
"For me."
"I’m their king."
"Mmhm."
"But you’ve just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
"I’m not asking."
"The North cannot be held, not by an outsider."
"It’s too big and too wild."
"And when the winter comes, the seven gods together couldn’t save you and your royal army."

"So you agree…"
"the Starks are enemies?"
"Everyone who isn’t us…"

"Mine."

"It’s called Needle."
"Oh, a blade with a name."
"And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle?"
"Your sister?"
"Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?"
"Stick ’em with the pointy end."

"You’re a Stark of Winterfell."
"You know our words."
"Winter is coming."
"You were born in the long summer."
"You’ve never known anything else."
"But now winter is truly coming."
"And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another."
"Sansa is your sister."
"I don’t hate her."
"Not really."
"I don’t want to frighten you, but I won’t lie to you either."
"We’ve come to a dangerous place."

"Go on."
"It’s yours."
"I can keep it?"
"Try not to stab your sister with it."
"If you’re going to own a sword, you’d better know how to use it."
"Don’t listen to it."
"Crows are all liars."
"I know a story about a crow."
"I hate your stories."
"I know a story about a boy who hated stories."
"I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall."
"Those were always your favourites."
"Those weren’t my favourites."
"My favourites were the scary ones."
"Oh, my sweet summer child."
"What do you know about fear?"
"Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep."
"Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die, all in darkness."
"That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the white walkers move through the woods."
"Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation."
"Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts."
"And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks."
"So is this the sort of story that you like?"
"In that darkness, the white walkers came for the first time."
"They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
"What are you telling him now?"
"Only what the little lord wants to hear."
"Get your supper."
"I want some time with him."
"One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant named Macomber."
"Maybe we do."
"How do you feel?"
"You still don’t remember anything?"
"Bran, I’ve seen you climb a thousand times."
"In the wind, in the rain…"
"A thousand times."
"You never fall."
"I did though."
"It’s true, isn’t it, what Maester Luwin says about my legs?"
"I’d rather be dead."
"Don’t ever say that."
"I’d rather be dead."
"Fewer eyes back here, my lady."
"But still too many."
"It’s nine years since I’ve set foot in the capital."
"And no one knew who I was the last time I came, either."
"My lady."
"Welcome to King’s Landing, Lady Stark."
"Would you mind following us?"
"I would."
"We’ve done nothing wrong."
"We’ve been instructed to escort you into the city."
"Instructed?"
"I don’t know who’s providing your instructions, but…"
"Follow me, Lady Stark."
"Cat!"
"Go on."
"Go upstairs."
"You little worm!"
"You take me for some backalley Sally you can drag into a…"
"Pssst!"
"I meant no disrespect, to you of all people."
"How dare you bring me here?"
"Have you lost your mind?"
"No one will come looking for you here."
"Isn’t that what you wanted?"
"I’m truly sorry…"
"about the locale."
"How did you know I was coming to King’s Landing?"
"A dear friend told me."
"Lady Stark."
"Lord Varys."
"To see you again after so many years is a blessing."
"Your poor hands."
"How did you know I was coming?"
"Knowledge is my trade, my lady."
"Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance?"
"My little birds are everywhere…"
"even in the North."
"They whisper to me the strangest stories."
"Valyrian steel."
"Do you know whose dagger this is?"
"I must admit I do not."
"Well, well, this is an historic day."
"Something you don’t know that I do."
"There’s only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms."
"It’s mine."
"Yours?"
"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey’s last nameday."
"I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would."
"When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
"To whom?"
"Tyrion Lannister."
"The Imp."
"Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of."
"If that were a real sword, you’d be dead."
"Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you."
"Pyp."
"Do you think Ned Stark’s bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
"Next!"
"Next!"
"Well, Lord Snow, it appears you’re the least useless person here."
"Go clean yourselves up!"
"There’s only so much I can stomach in a day."
"A charming man."
"I don’t need him to be charming."
"I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night’s Watch."
"And how’s that going, Commander Mormont?"
"Slowly."
"A raven came…"
"for Ned Stark’s son."
"Good news or bad?"
"Both."
"Lord Stark."
"I meant…"
"to give you this earlier."
"So forgetful these days."
"A raven from Winterfell this morning."
"Good news?"
"Perhaps you’d like to share it with your wife."
"My wife is in Winterfell."
"Is she?"
"Yes, I’m looking at you."
"I thought that she’d be safest in here."
"One of several such establishments I own."
"You’re a funny man."
"Huh?"
"A very funny man."
"Ned!"
"Ah, the Starks…"
"Quick tempers, slow minds."
"You broke my nose, bastard!"
"It’s an improvement."
"If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit."
"I wonder if they’d find you before the wolves did."
"What are you looking at, halfman?"
"I’m looking at you."
"Yes."
"You’ve got an interesting face."
"Hmm, very distinctive faces."
"All of you."
"And what do you care about our faces?"
"It’s just…"
"I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King’s Landing."
"Perhaps I’ll write to my sister, the queen, about it."
"We’ll talk later, Lord Snow."
"Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me."
"No one but you."
"My father knew and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same."
"Grenn’s father left him too…"
"outside a farmhouse, when he was three."
"Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese."
"His little sister hadn’t eaten in three days."
"He was given a choice his right hand or the Wall."
"I’ve been asking the Lord Commander about them."
"Fascinating stories."
"They hate me because I’m better than they are."
"It’s a lucky thing none of them were trained by a masteratarms like your Ser Rodrik."
"I don’t imagine any of them had ever held a real sword before they came here."
"Oh…"
"Your brother Bran."
"He’s woken up."
"The mere suggestion that the queen’s brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason."
"We have proof."
"We have the blade."
"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him."
"The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy’s wolf."
"Petyr has promised to help us find the truth."
"He’s like a little brother to me, Ned."
"He would never betray my trust."
"I’ll try to keep you alive, for her sake."
"A fool’s task, admittedly, but I’ve never been able to refuse your wife anything."
"I won’t forget this."
"You’re a true friend."
"Don’t tell anyone."
"I have a reputation to maintain."
"How could you be so stupid?"
"Calm down."
"He’s a child."
"Ten years old."
"What were you thinking?"
"I was thinking of us."
"You’re a bit late to start complaining about it now."
"What has the boy told them?"
"Nothing."
"He remembers nothing."
"Then what are you raving about?"
"What if it comes back to him?"
"If he tells his father what he saw…"
"We’ll say he was lying."
"We’ll say he was dreaming."
"We’ll say whatever we like."
"I think we can outfox a tenyearold."
"And my husband?"
"I’ll go to war with him if I have to."
"They can write a ballad about us “The War For Cersei’s Cunt."
"” Let me go."
"Never."
"Let me go."
"The boy won’t talk."
"And if he does, I’ll kill him."
"Him, Ned Stark, the king the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
"I wish I could see the girls."
"It’s too dangerous."
"Just for a moment."
"Until we know who our enemies are."
"I know they did it, Ned."
"The Lannisters."
"In my bones, I know it."
"Littlefinger’s right."
"I can’t do anything without proof."
"And if you find the proof?"
"Then I bring it to Robert…"
"and hope he’s still the man I once knew."
"You watch yourself on the road, huh?"
"That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
"My temper?"
"Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
"He still loves you."
"Does he?"
"Off with you."
"Yes, it’s been a long time."
"But I still remember every face."
"You remember your first?"
"Of course, Your Grace."
"Who was it?"
"A Tyroshi."
"Never learned the name."
"Hmm."
"How did you do it?"
"Lance through the heart."
"Quick one."
"Lucky for you."
"Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall."
"My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud."
"He came running at me, this dumb highborn lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword."
"I knocked him down with the hammer."
"Gods, I was strong then."
"Caved in his breastplate."
"Probably shattered every rib he had."
"Stood over him, hammer in the air."
"Right before I brought it down he shouted, “Wait!"
"Wait."
"” They never tell you how they all shit themselves."
"They don’t put that part in the songs."
"Stupid boy."
"Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else."
"He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys, and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he’d be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl."
"Wine!"
"Lancel."
"Gods, what a stupid name."
"Lancel Lannister."
"Who named you?"
"Some halfwit with a stutter?"
"What are you doing?"
"It’s empty, Your Grace."
"What do you mean, it’s empty?"
"There’s no more wine."
"Is that what empty means?"
"!"
"So get more."
"Tell your cousin to get in here."
"Kingslayer!"
"Get in here."
"Surrounded by Lannisters."
"Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces."
"It must wound your pride, huh?"
"Standing out there like a glorified sentry."
"Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin…"
"forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks."
"So come on."
"We’re telling war stories."
"Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
"One of the outlaws in the brotherhood."
"I was there that day."
"You were only a squire, years old."
"You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte."
"Best move I ever saw."
"A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
"Your outlaw…"
"any last words?"
"I cut his head off, so no."
"Hmm."
"What about Aerys Targaryen?"
"What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back?"
"I never asked."
"Did he call you a traitor?"
"Did he plead for a reprieve?"
"He said the same thing he’d been saying for hours…"
"“Burn them all."
"” If that’s all, Your Grace…"
"Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?"
"The Dothraki don’t believe in money."
"Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts."
"From whom?"
"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices pay tribute or fight."
"An easy choice for most."
"Of course, sometimes it’s not enough."
"Sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he’s given."
"He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly."
"Sometimes a khal decides his riders haven’t had a good fight in months and need the practice."
"Tell them all to stop."
"You want the entire horde to stop?"
"For how long?"
"Until I command them otherwise."
"You’re learning to talk like a queen."
"Not a queen."
"A khaleesi."
"You dare!"
"You give commands to me?"
"To me?"
"You do not command the dragon."
"I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
"I don’t take orders from savages or their sluts."
"Do you hear me?"
"Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
"No."
"Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
"Please."
"Please, don’t hurt him."
"Tell him I don’t want my brother harmed."
"Huh?"
"Mormont!"
"Kill these Dothraki dogs!"
"I am your king!"
"Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?"
"Uh uh uh uh uh."
"You…"
"walk."
"I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time."
"I’m leaving this morning."
"You’re leaving?"
"I’m the First Ranger."
"My job is out there."
"There have been disturbing reports."
"What kind of reports?"
"The kind I don’t want to believe."
"I’m ready."
"I won’t let you down."
"You’re not going."
"You’re no ranger, Jon."
"But I’m better than every…"
"Better than no one!"
"Here…"
"a man gets what he earns, when he earns it."
"We’ll speak when I return."
"A bear’s balls."
"Oh, you’re joking?"
"And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart, all fried in his own fat."
"When you’re a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
"And how do a bear’s balls taste?"
"A bit chewy."
"And what about you, my lord?"
"What’s the strangest thing you’ve eaten?"
"Do Dornish girls count?"
"So…"
"you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bring them here as eager recruits?"
"Aye."
"But it’s not all of ’em’s done bad things."
"Some of ’em’s just poor lads looking for steady feed."
"Some of ’em’s highborn lads looking for glory."
"They have a better chance finding feed than glory."
"The Night’s Watch is a joke to you, is it?"
"Is that what we are, Lannister?"
"An army of jesters in black?"
"You don’t have enough men to be an army and, aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
"I hope we’ve provided you with some good stories to tell when you’re back in King’s Landing."
"It’s something to think about while you’re drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels."
"Half the boys you’ve seen training will die north of the Wall."
"Might be a wildling’s axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold."
"They die in pain."
"And they do it…"
"so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
"Do you think I’m plump?"
"Listen, Benjen…"
"May I call you Benjen?"
"Call me what you like."
"I’m not sure what I’ve done to offend you."
"I have great admiration for the Night’s Watch."
"I’ve great admiration for you as First Ranger."
"You know, my brother once told me…"
"that nothing someone says before the word “but” really counts."
"But…"
"I don’t believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the Wall."
"I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when that wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
"You’re right."
"The wildlings are no different from us."
"A little rougher maybe."
"But they’re made of meat and bone."
"I know how to track them and I know how to kill them."
"It’s not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights."
"You’ve never been north of the Wall, so don’t tell me what’s out there."
"Are you going below?"
"Keep well, keep warm."
"Enjoy the capital, brother."
"Oh, I always do."
"I think he’s starting to like me."
"“Going below”?"
"Aye."
"Into the tunnel and out the other side."
"He’ll be north of the Wall for a month or two."
"So…"
"you’re heading down to King’s Landing too."
"Aye, day after tomorrow."
"I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons."
"Let’s share the road."
"I could use some decent company."
"I, er…"
"I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord."
"Not this time."
"We’ll be staying at the finest castles and inns."
"No one turns away a Lannister."
"Yes, Khaleesi."
"Oh, what are you doing?"
"When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?"
"You change, Khaleesi."
"It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle."
"It’s a good weapon for a Dothrakan."
"But a man in full plate…"
"…"
"the arakh won’t get through the steel."
"That’s where the broadsword has the advantage."
"Designed for piercing plate."
"Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses."
"Armour."
"Armour."
"Armour make a man, erm…"
"Slow."
"Slow."
"It’s true, but it also keeps a man alive."
"My father taught me how to fight."
"He taught me that speed defeats size."
"I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior."
"He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo."
"And your father, Jorah the Andal?"
"He was a warrior also?"
"He still is."
"A man of great honour and I betrayed him."
"The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight."
"Kill some rabbits."
"There are no rabbits."
"Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
"Have you seen any ducks, woman?"
"No rabbits, no ducks."
"Do you have eyes in your head?"
"Do you?"
"Dog then."
"I have seen many dogs."
"I don’t think she wants to eat dog."
"The khaleesi have baby inside her."
"It is true."
"She does not bleed for two moons."
"Her belly start to swell."
"A blessing from the Great Stallion."
"She does not want to eat horse."
"I’ll have the boys butcher a goat for supper."
"I need to ride to Qohor."
"Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak."
"Don’t worry."
"I’ll catch you."
"The horde’s easy to find."
"Don’t stand so still."
"It’s harder to hit a moving target."
"Except for you."
"You move too much."
"I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me."
"How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
"Eight."
"No, nine."
"All of them brief?"
"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
"This summer has lasted nine."
"But reports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter."
"The Starks are always right eventually winter is coming."
"This one will be long…"
"and dark things will come with it."
"We’ve been capturing wildlings, more every month."
"They’re fleeing south."
"The ones who flee…"
"say they’ve seen the white walkers."
"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
"One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions."
"He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off."
"The Night’s Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond."
"And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men."
"There are less than a thousand of us now."
"We can’t man the other castles on the Wall."
"We can’t properly patrol the wilderness."
"We’ve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed."
"Your sister sits by the side of the king."
"Tell her…"
"we need help."
"When winter does come, gods help us all if we’re not ready."
"It’s a boy."
"How do you know?"
"I know."
"I’m sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
"It’s either me or this cold, and it doesn’t appear to be going anywhere."
"Will you stop at Winterfell on your way south?"
"I expect I will."
"Gods know there aren’t many feather beds between here and King’s Landing."
"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him."
"Tell him I’d visit if I could."
"Of course."
"He’ll never walk again."
"If you’re going to be a cripple, it’s better to be a rich cripple."
"You take care, Snow."
"Farewell, my lord."
"You are late, boy."
"Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
"Who are you?"
"Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
"Tomorrow you will catch it."
"Now pick it up."
"That is not the way, boy."
"It is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it."
"It’s too heavy."
"It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong."
"Just so."
"One hand is all that is needed."
"Now you are standing all wrong."
"Turn your body sideface."
"Yes."
"So."
"You are skinny."
"That is good."
"The target is smaller."
"Now the grip let me see."
"Yes."
"The grip must be delicate."
"What if I drop it?"
"The steel must be part of your arm."
"Can you drop part of your arm?"
"No."
"Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
"He knows these things."
"You must listen to me, boy."
"I’m a girl."
"Boy, girl…"
"You are a sword, that is all."
"That is the grip."
"You are not holding a battleaxe."
"You are holding…"
"A needle."
"Ahhh."
"Just so."
"Now we will begin the dance."
"Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning…"
"The knight’s dance, hacking and hammering."
"This is the Braavos dance…"
"the water dance."
"It is swift…"
"and sudden."
"All men are made of water."
"Do you know this?"
"If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die."
"Now you will try to strike me."
"Ha!"
"Up!"
"Ha!"
"Ah."
"Dead."
"Oh!"
"Dead."
"Hup!"
"Very dead."
"Come."
"Ah ah ah!"
"Hup!"
"Again, faster."
"Ah."
""
"S1E4"
"The little lord’s been dreaming again."
"We have visitors."
"I don’t want to see anyone."
"Really?"
"If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I’d go mad."
"Anyway, you don’t have a choice."
"Robb’s waiting."
"I don’t want to go."
"Neither do I."
"But Robb’s Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say."
"Hodor!"
"Hodor?"
"Help Bran down the hall."
"Hodor."
"I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit."
"Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome at Winterfell."
"Any man of the Night’s Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
"I’m not your boy, Lannister."
"I’m Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
"Then you might learn a lord’s courtesy."
"So it’s true."
"Hello, Bran."
"Do you remember anything about what happened?"
"He has no memory of that day."
"Curious."
"Why are you here?"
"Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?"
"My neck is beginning to hurt."
"Kneel, Hodor."
"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
"Yes."
"Well, I mean I did like to."
"The boy has lost the use of his legs."
"What of it?"
"With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
"I’m not a cripple."
"Then I’m not a dwarf."
"My father will rejoice to hear it."
"I have a gift for you."
"Give that to your saddler."
"He’ll provide the rest."
"You must shape the horse to the rider."
"Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy’s voice."
"Will I really be able to ride?"
"You will."
"On horseback you will be as tall as any of them."
"Is this some kind of trick?"
"Why do you want to help him?"
"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
"You’ve done my brother a kindness."
"The hospitality of Winterfell is yours."
"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark."
"There’s a brothel outside your walls."
"There I’ll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
"Couldn’t resist some northern arse?"
"If you like Redheads, ask for Ros."
"Come to see me off, Greyjoy?"
"Kind of you."
"Your master doesn’t seem to like Lannisters."
"He’s not my master."
"No, of course not."
"What happened here?"
"Where is Lady Stark?"
"Why didn’t she receive me?"
"She wasn’t feeling well."
"She’s not in Winterfell, is she?"
"Where did she go?"
"M’lady’s whereabouts…"
"M’lady?"
"Your loyalty to your captors is touching."
"Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?"
"I still remember seeing my father’s fleet burn in Lannisport."
"I believe your uncles were responsible."
"Must have been a pretty sight."
"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive."
"Yes, a great victory for your people."
"Shame how it all turned out."
"We were outnumbered ten to one."
"A stupid rebellion, then."
"I suppose your father realised that when your brothers died in battle."
"Now here you are, your enemy’s squire."
"Careful, Imp."
"I’ve offended you."
"Forgive me, it’s been a rough morning."
"Anyway, don’t despair."
"I’m a constant disappointment to my own father and I’ve learned to live with it."
"Your next tumble with Ros is on me."
"I’ll try not to wear her out."
"Shoulder, legs."
"Leg, shoulder, leg."
"Left foot forward."
"Good."
"Now pivot as you deliver the stroke."
"Put all your weight behind it."
"What in seven hells is that?"
"They’ll need an eighth hell to fit him in."
"Tell them your name."
"Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill…"
"I mean, I was of Horn Hill."
"I’ve come to take the black."
"Come to take the black pudding."
"Well, you couldn’t be any worse than you look."
"Rast…"
"see what he can do."
"I yield."
"Please, no more."
"On your feet."
"Pick up your sword."
"Hit him till he finds his feet."
"It seems they’ve run short of poachers and thieves down south."
"Now they send us squealing bloody pigs."
"Jon!"
"Again, harder."
"I yield!"
"Enough!"
"He yielded."
"Looks like the bastard’s in love."
"All right then, Lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let’s make it an exercise."
"You two."
"Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal."
"All you’ve got to do is get past the bastard."
"Are you sure you want to do this?"
"No."
"Yield, yield, yield!"
"I yield."
"We’re done for today."
"Go clean the armoury."
"That’s all you’re good for."
"Well fought!"
"Piss off."
"Did he hurt you?"
"I’ve had worse."
"You can call me Sam…"
"if you want."
"My mother calls me Sam."
"It’s not going to get any easier, you know?"
"You’re going to have to defend yourself."
"Why didn’t you get up and fight?"
"I wanted to."
"I just couldn’t."
"Why not?"
"I’m a coward."
"My father always says so."
"The Wall’s no place for cowards."
"You’re right."
"I’m sorry."
"I just…"
"wanted to thank you."
"A bloody coward."
"People saw us talking to him."
"Now they’ll think we’re cowards too."
"You’re too stupid to be a coward."
"You’re too stupid to be a…"
"Quick now, before summer’s over."
"Come here!"
"Hyah, hyah!"
"Vaes Dothrak the city of the horselords."
"A pile of mud."
"Mud and shit and twigs."
"Best these savages can do."
"These are my people now."
"You shouldn’t call them savages."
"I’ll call them what I like, because they’re my people."
"This is my army."
"Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
"The Dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea."
"They fear any water their horses can’t drink."
"But if they did?"
"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
"And you know these men?"
"I fought beside them once, long ago."
"Now Ned Stark wants my head."
"He drove me from my land."
"You sold slaves."
"Aye."
"Why?"
"I had no money and an expensive wife."
"And where is she now?"
"In another place, with another man."
"Your Grace?"
"Yes, my dear?"
"They call you the last dragon…"
"They do."
"You have dragon’s blood in your veins?"
"It’s entirely possible."
"What happened to the dragons?"
"I was told that brave men killed them all."
"The brave men didn’t kill dragons."
"The brave men rode them."
"Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen."
"The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me."
"The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them…"
"melted together like so many candles."
"I have always wanted to see a dragon."
"There’s nothing in the world that I would rather see."
"Really."
"Why dragons?"
"They can fly."
"And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they’re somewhere else…"
"far away."
"And they can kill."
"Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing…"
"…"
"melted…"
"like so many candles."
"Ow."
"Yes."
"Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
"Well, after years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
"I was not locked in."
"I have seen things."
"What have you seen?"
"I’ve seen…"
"a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass."
"Ooh."
"I’ve seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes."
"And I’ve seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of coloured silk."
"So…"
"have you seen one?"
"A pirate ship?"
"A dragon."
"No."
"No, the last one died many years before I was born."
"I’ll tell you what I have seen their skulls."
"They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep."
"When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I’d recite their names for him."
"When I got them all right, he’d give me a sweet."
"The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong with skulls no bigger than dog skulls."
"But…"
"But as you got closer to the Iron Throne…"
"they got bigger and bigger and bigger."
"There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius…"
"…"
"Archonei, Meraxes, Vhagar…"
"and Balerion the Dread…"
"…"
"whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one."
"What happened to the skulls?"
"I don’t know."
"The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect."
"Scattered to the wind."
"That’s very sad."
"Yes, it is."
"What did I buy you for?"
"To make me sad?"
"No, Your Grace."
"To, uh, teach your sister."
"To teach my sister how to be a better lover?"
"You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy?"
"Oh, you pretty little idiot."
"Go on, then."
"Get on with it."
"Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side."
"And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court."
"All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince."
"What if I have a girl?"
"Gods be good, you’ll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
"What if I only have girls?"
"I wouldn’t worry about that."
"Jeyne Poole’s mother had five children all of them girls."
"Yes, but it’s highly unlikely."
"But what if?"
"Well, if you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey’s little brother."
"And everyone would hate me."
"Nobody could ever hate you."
"Joffrey does."
"Nonsense."
"Why would you say such a thing?"
"That business with the wolves?"
"Sansa…"
"I’ve told you a hundred times a direwolf is not…"
"Please shut up about it."
"Do you remember your lessons?"
"Who built the Iron Throne?"
"Aegon the Conqueror."
"And who built the Red Keep?"
"Maegor the Cruel."
"And how many years did it take to build…"
"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren’t they?"
"They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
"The Mad King."
"Commonly known as the Mad King."
"Why were they killed?"
"You should speak to your father about these matters."
"I don’t want to speak to my father, ever."
"Sansa, you will find it in your heart to forgive your father."
"No, I won’t."
"It’s the Hand’s Tournament that’s causing all this trouble, my lords."
"The King’s Tournament."
"I assure you the Hand wants no part of it."
"Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day."
"Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
"Dreadful."
"If you can’t keep the king’s peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
"I need more men."
"You’ll get ."
"Lord Baelish will see it paid for."
"I will?"
"You found money for a champion’s purse, you can find money to keep the peace."
"I’ll also give you of my household guard till the crowds have left."
"Thank you, my lord Hand, ser."
"They will be put to good use."
"The sooner this is over, the better."
"The realm prospers from such events, my lord."
"They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
"And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged."
"I’m sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket."
"Hmm."
"Now…"
"if there’s nothing else, my lords?"
"Oh, this heat."
"On days like this, I envy you northerners, your summer snows."
"Until tomorrow, my lord."
"I’ve been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn."
"Lord Arryn?"
"Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us."
"I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him."
"His sickness struck him very hard and very fast."
"I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed."
"Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
"Why?"
"I have been grand maester for many years."
"Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since…"
"What did Jon want the night before he died?"
"Oh, he came inquiring after a book."
"A book?"
"What book?"
"Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord."
"A…"
"A ponderous tome."
"No, I’d like to read it."
"The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."
"Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber in the rd year after Aegon’s landing, at the Last Hearth."
"Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt."
"As I said, my lord, a ponderous read."
"Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?"
"He did not, my lord."
"And I did not presume to ask."
"Jon’s death…"
"Such a tragedy."
"…"
"did he say anything to you during his final hours?"
"Nothing of import, my lord."
"Oh."
"There was one phrase he kept repeating."
"“The seed is strong,” I think it was."
"“The seed is strong”?"
"Mmm."
"What does that mean?"
"Oh, the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark."
"For all the weight they’re given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
"And you’re quite certain he died of a natural illness?"
"What else could it be?"
"Poison."
"A disturbing thought."
"No, no, no, I don’t think it likely."
"The Hand was loved by all."
"What sort of man would dare…"
"I’ve heard it said that poison is a woman’s weapon."
"Yes, women, cravens…"
"and eunuchs."
"Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch?"
"Everybody knows that."
"Yes, yes, of course."
"How that sort of person found himself on the king’s council, I will never know."
"I’ve taken enough of your time."
"No trouble at all, my lord."
"It’s a great honour."
"Thank you."
"I’ll find my own way out."
"Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours."
"It’s a hard fall down these steps."
"Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better."
"Tomorrow I’m going to be chasing cats."
"Cats?"
"Syrio says."
"He says every swordsman should study cats."
"They’re as quiet as shadows and as light as feathers."
"You have to be quick to catch them."
"He’s right about that."
"Now that Bran’s awake, will he come live with us?"
"Well, he needs to get his strength back first."
"He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard."
"He can’t be one now, can he?"
"No."
"But someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king’s council."
"Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder."
"Can I be lord of a holdfast?"
"You will marry a high lord and rule his castle."
"And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords."
"Hmm?"
"No."
"That’s not me."
"Hello."
"Ser Alliser said I’m to be your new watch partner."
"I should warn you, I don’t see all that well."
"Come stand by the fire."
"It’s warmer."
"No, that’s all right."
"I’m fine."
"You’re not."
"You’re freezing."
"I don’t like high places."
"You can’t fight."
"You can’t see."
"You’re afraid of heights and almost everything else probably."
"What are you doing here, Sam?"
"On the morning of my th nameday, my father came to me."
"“You’re almost a man now,” he said."
"“But you’re not worthy of my land and title."
"“Tomorrow, you’re going to take the black, “forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north."
"“If you do not,” he said, “then we’ll have a hunt “and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble “and you’ll be thrown from your saddle to die."
"“Or so I’ll tell your mother."
"“Nothing would please me more."
"” Ser Alliser’s going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn’t he?"
"Yes, he is."
"I’m not going to get any better, you know."
"Well…"
"you can’t get any worse."
"I hear you’re reading a boring book."
"Hmph."
"Pycelle talks too much."
"Oh, he never stops."
"Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?"
"Not surprising."
"Until recently, he was only a squire Jon Arryn’s squire."
"He was knighted almost immediately after his master’s untimely death."
"Knighted for what?"
"Why are you telling me this?"
"I promised Cat that I’d help you."
"Where is Ser Hugh?"
"I’ll speak to him."
"A singularly bad idea."
"Do you see that boy there?"
"One of Varys’s little birds."
"The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings."
"Now look there."
"That one belongs to the queen."
"And do you see that septa pretending to read her book?"
"Varys or the queen?"
"No, she’s one of mine."
"Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?"
"Yes."
"The wiser answer was no, my lord."
"Get a message to this paragon of yours discreetly."
"Send him to question Ser Hugh."
"After that, you might want him to visit a certain armourer in the city."
"He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel."
"Why?"
"I have my observers, as I said, and it’s possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armourer several times in the weeks before his death."
"Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
"Distrusting me was the wisest thing you’ve done since you climbed off your horse."
"…"
"Ser Hugh? …"
"Ser Hugh!"
"As you can see, I’m busy."
"I’m here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King."
"I’m the captain of his guard."
"I’m sorry."
"I didn’t catch your name, Ser…"
"No “ser”."
"I’m not a knight."
"I see."
"Well, it just so happens that I am."
"He said he’d be glad to talk to the Hand himself."
"He’s a knight, you see."
"Ah, a knight."
"They strut around like roosters down here."
"Even the ones who’ve never seen an arrow coming their way."
"You shouldn’t be out here, my lord."
"There’s no telling who has eyes where."
"Let them look."
"The former Hand did call on me, my lord, several times."
"I regret to say he did not honour me with his patronage."
"What did Lord Arryn want?"
"He always came to see the boy."
"I’d like to see him as well."
"As you wish, my lord."
"Gendry!"
"Here he is."
"Strong for his age."
"He works hard."
"Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
"This is fine work."
"It’s not for sale."
"Boy, this is the King’s Hand!"
"If his lordship wants the helmet…"
"I made it for me."
"Forgive him, my lord."
"There’s nothing to forgive."
"When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
"He just asked me questions is all, my lord."
"What kind of questions?"
"About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here."
"But then he started asking me about my mother."
"Your mother?"
"Who she was, what she looked like."
"What did you tell him?"
"She died when I was little."
"She had yellow hair."
"She’d sing to me sometimes."
"Look at me."
"Get back to work, lad."
"If the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
"Find anything?"
"King Robert’s bastard son."
"He likes that."
"This is for the king from Lord Stark."
"Should I leave it with…"
"Shhh."
"Listen."
"Do you hear them?"
"How many do you think are in there with him?"
"Huh?"
"Guess."
"Three."
"Four."
"He likes to do this when I’m on duty."
"He makes me listen as he insults my sister."
"Forgive me, my lord…"
"Why do I have to forgive you?"
"Have you wronged me?"
"We’ve met before, you know."
"Have we?"
"Strange, I’ve forgotten."
"The siege of Pyke."
"We fought side by side one afternoon."
"Ah."
"That’s where you got your scar?"
"Aye."
"Oh."
"One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye."
"Vicious sons of whores."
"They like their bloodshed."
"They stopped liking it at the end."
"That was a proper battle."
"Do you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?"
"With his burning sword?"
"I’ll remember that till the day I die."
"I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell."
"It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop."
"Theon?"
"He’s a good lad."
"I doubt it."
"I’ll bet you smell of blackberry jam!"
""
"Let me smell it."
"Come here."
"Can I leave this with you?"
"The message from Lord Stark."
"I don’t serve Lord Stark."
"Where have you been?"
"Watch duty."
"With Sam."
"Ah, Prince Porkchop."
"Where is he?"
"He wasn’t hungry."
"Impossible!"
"That’s enough."
"Sam’s no different from the rest of us."
"There was no place for him in the world, so he’s come here."
"We’re not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore."
"Never again, no matter what Thorne says."
"He’s our brother now and we’re going to protect him."
"You are in love, Lord Snow."
"You girls can do as you please."
"But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I’m gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
"No one touches Sam."
"What are you waiting for?"
"Attack him!"
"You get in there."
"Hit me."
"Go on, hit me!"
"I yield!"
"Yield."
"Yield."
"I yield."
"You think this is funny, do you?"
"When you’re out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back?"
"Or a snivelling boy?"
"You send this whore to give me commands?"
"I should have sent you back her head!"
"Forgive me, Khaleesi."
"I did as you asked."
"Hush now."
"It’s all right."
"Irri, take her and leave us."
"Yes, Khaleesi."
"Why did you hit her?"
"How many times do I have to tell you?"
"You do not command me."
"I wasn’t commanding you."
"I just wanted to invite you to supper."
"What’s this?"
"It’s a gift."
"I had it made for you."
"Dothraki rags?"
"Are you going to dress me now?"
"Please."
"This stinks of manure."
"All of it."
"Stop."
"Stop."
"Stop it."
"You would turn me into one of them, wouldn’t you?"
"Next you’ll want to braid my hair."
"You’ve no right to a braid."
"You’ve won no victories yet."
"You do not talk back to me!"
"You are a horselord’s slut."
"And now you’ve woken the dragon…"
"I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!"
"I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me."
"The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands."
"I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole’s Town."
"I wouldn’t doubt it."
"Don’t you think it’s a little bit unfair?"
"Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little Sally on the side?"
"Sally on the side?"
"It’s silly, isn’t it?"
"What, we can’t defend the Wall unless we’re celibate?"
"It’s absurd."
"I didn’t think you’d be so upset about it."
"Why not?"
"Because I’m fat?"
"No."
"But I like girls just as much as you do."
"They might not like me as much."
"I’ve never…"
"been with one."
"You’ve probably had hundreds."
"No."
"As a matter of fact, I’m the same as you."
"Yeah."
"Yeah, I…"
"I find that hard to believe."
"I came very close once."
"I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but…"
"Didn’t know where to put it?"
"I know where to put it."
"Was she…"
"old and ugly?"
"Young and gorgeous."
"A whore named Ros."
"What colour hair?"
"Red."
"Oh, I like red hair."
"And her, um…"
"Her…"
"You don’t want to know."
"What, that good?"
"Better."
"Oh, no."
"So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect?"
"What’s my name?"
"Jon Snow."
"And why is my surname Snow?"
"Because…"
"you’re a bastard from the North."
"I never met my mother."
"My father wouldn’t even tell me her name."
"I don’t know if she’s living or dead."
"I don’t know if she’s a noblewoman or a fisherman’s wife…"
"or a whore."
"So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes."
"But I couldn’t do it."
"Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow?"
"It’s not a good life for a child."
"Ah, mmm."
"So…"
"you didn’t know where to put it?"
"Enjoying yourselves?"
"You look cold, boys."
"It is a bit nippy."
"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors."
"It’s still summer."
"Do you boys even remember the last winter?"
"How long has it been now?"
"What, years?"
"I remember."
"Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?"
"Were there days when you just couldn’t get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
"I build my own fires."
"That’s admirable."
"I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter."
"It was supposed to be a twoweek mission."
"We heard a rumour Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch."
"So we went out to look for some of his men capture them, gather some knowledge."
"The wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men."
"Harder than you’ll ever be."
"They know their country better than we do."
"They knew there was a storm coming in."
"So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass."
"And we got caught in the open."
"Wind so strong it yanked foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all."
"If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost."
"And all in darkness."
"You don’t know cold."
"Neither of you do."
"The horses died first."
"We didn’t have enough to feed them, to keep them warm."
"Eating the horses was easy."
"But later when we started to fall…"
"That wasn’t easy."
"We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn’t we?"
"Soft, fat boys like you."
"We’d have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones left over for soup."
"Soon we’ll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment, and they will call you men of the Night’s Watch, but you’d be fools to believe it."
"You’re boys still."
"And come the winter you will die…"
"like flies."
"I hit him."
"I hit the dragon."
"Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon."
"Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake."
"He is still the true king."
"The truth now."
"Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?"
"No."
"But the common people are waiting for him."
"Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return."
"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends."
"They don’t care what games the high lords play."
"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
"Home."
"I pray for home too."
"My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms."
"He couldn’t lead an army even if my husband gave him one."
"He’ll never take us home."
"Lovers’ quarrel?"
"I’m sorry."
"Do I?"
"Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish."
"He’s known…"
"An old friend of the family."
"I’ve known your mother a long, long time."
"Why do they call you Littlefinger?"
"Arya!"
"Don’t be rude!"
"No, it’s quite all right."
"When I was a child, I was very small, and I come from a little spit of land called the Fingers, so you see, it’s an exceedingly clever nickname."
"I’ve been sitting here for days!"
"Start the damn joust before I piss myself!"
"Gods, who’s that?"
"Ser Gregor Clegane."
"They call him the Mountain."
"The Hound’s older brother."
"And his opponent?"
"Ser Hugh of the Vale."
"He was Jon Arryn’s squire."
"Look how far he’s come."
"Yes, yes, enough of the bloody pomp."
"Have at him!"
"Not what you were expecting?"
"Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound?"
"Lovely little tale of brotherly love."
"The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe."
"Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation."
"Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence."
"One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire Gregor’s toy, a wooden knight."
"Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals."
"Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted."
"There aren’t very many people who know that story."
"I won’t tell anyone."
"I promise."
"No, please don’t."
"If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I’m afraid all the knights in King’s Landing would not be able to save you."
"My lord, Her Grace the queen."
"Your Grace."
"You’re missing your tournament."
"Putting my name on it doesn’t make it mine."
"I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us the ugliness with the wolves."
"And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme."
"Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned."
"How is Sansa?"
"She likes it here."
"She’s the only Stark who does."
"Favours her mother, not much of the North in her."
"What are you doing here?"
"I might ask the same of you."
"What is it you hope to accomplish?"
"The king called on me to serve him and the realm, and that’s what I’ll do until he tells me otherwise."
"You can’t change him."
"You can’t help him."
"He’ll do what he wants, which is all he’s ever done."
"You’ll try your best to pick up the pieces."
"If that’s my job, then so be it."
"You’re just a soldier, aren’t you?"
"You take your orders and you carry on."
"I suppose it makes sense."
"Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
"As was I."
"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
"And to you."
"Boy!"
"Bread, meat and beer."
"Quickly."
"Ah, good idea, Grandfather."
"I’m starving."
"A song while we wait or?"
"I’d rather throw myself down a well."
"Now, now, Grandfather, this may be your last chance if you’re heading North."
"The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
"Gods."
"I’m sorry, my lord."
"We’re full up."
"Every room."
"My men can sleep in the stable."
"As for myself, I don’t require a large room."
"Truly, my lord, we have nothing."
"Is there nothing I can do…"
"…"
"to remedy this?"
"You can have my room."
"Now there’s a clever man."
"You can manage food, I trust?"
"Yoren, dine with me."
"Aye, my lord."
"My lord of Lannister!"
"Might I entertain you while you eat?"
"I can sing of your father’s victory at King’s Landing!"
"Nothing would more likely ruin my supper."
"Lady Stark!"
"What an unexpected pleasure."
"I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell."
"Lady Stark!"
"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here."
"You, ser."
"Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
"It is, my lady."
"And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?"
"She is."
"The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun."
"My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen."
"Our lord is honoured by his trust."
"I envy your father all his fine friends, Lady Stark, but I don’t quite see the purpose of this."
"I know your sigil as well the twin towers of Frey."
"How fares your lord, ser?"
"Lord Walder is well, my lady."
"He has asked your father for the honour of his presence on his th nameday."
"He plans to take another wife."
"Ha!"
"This man…"
"came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son."
"A boy of ."
"In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king’s justice."
""
"S1E5"
"Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?"
"No."
"I stood vigil for him myself last night."
"He had no one else."
"He’d never worn this armour before."
"Bad luck for him going against the Mountain."
"Who determines the draw?"
"All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
"Aye."
"But who holds the straws?"
"You’ve done good work, Sisters."
"Life is strange."
"Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident."
"I’m glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan."
"As is my wife."
"I don’t think the widow’s life would suit her."
"You’re too modest."
"I’ve seen you cut down a dozen great knights."
"My father once told me you were the best he’d ever seen."
"I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat."
"He was a fine man, your father."
"What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
"And that lad he was a squire until a few months ago."
"How could he afford a new suit of armour?"
"Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?"
"I hear the king wants to joust today."
"Yes, that will never happen."
"Robert tends to do what he wants."
"If the king got what he wanted all the time, he’d still be fighting a damned rebellion."
"It’s made too small, Your Grace."
"It won’t go."
"Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse."
"Did you know that?"
"Look at this idiot!"
"One ball and no brains."
"He can’t even put a man’s armour on him properly."
"You’re too fat for your armour."
"Fat?"
"Fat, is it?"
"Is that how you speak to your king?"
"Oh, it’s funny, is it?"
"No, Your Grace."
"No?"
"You don’t like the Hand’s joke?"
"You’re torturing the poor boy."
"You heard the Hand."
"The king’s too fat for his armour."
"Go find the breastplate stretcher now!"
"“The breastplate stretcher”?"
"How long before he figures it out?"
"Maybe you should have one invented."
"All right, all right."
"You watch me out there."
"I still know how to point a lance."
"You’ve no business jousting."
"Leave that for the young men."
"Why, because I’m king?"
"Piss on that."
"I want to hit somebody!"
"And who’s going to hit you back?"
"Anybody who can."
"And the last man in his saddle…"
"Will be you."
"There’s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you."
"Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?"
"Aye."
"Drink."
"I’m not thirsty."
"Drink."
"Your king commands it."
"Gods, too fat for my armour."
"Your squire a Lannister boy?"
"Mm."
"A bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted."
"I have Jon Arryn to thank for her."
"“Cersei Lannister will make a good match,” he told me."
"“You’ll need her father on your side."
"” I thought being king meant I could do whatever I wanted."
"Enough of this."
"Let’s go watch ’em ride."
"At least I can smell someone else’s blood."
"Robert."
"What?"
"Oh."
"An inspiring sight for the people, eh?"
"Come, bow before your king!"
"Bow, you shits!"
"Where’s Arya?"
"At her dancing lessons."
"The Knight of the Flowers."
"Thank you, Ser Loras."
"Don’t let Ser Gregor hurt him."
"Hey."
"I can’t watch."
"A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain."
"I’ll take that bet."
"Now what will I buy with gold dragons?"
"A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?"
"Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?"
"Or you could even buy a friend."
"He’s going to die."
"Ser Loras rides well."
"Such a shame, Littlefinger."
"It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
"Loras knew his mare was in heat."
"Quite crafty, really."
"Ser Loras would never do that."
"There’s no honour in tricks."
"No honour and quite a bit of gold."
"Sword!"
"Leave him be!"
"Stop this madness in the name of your king!"
"Let him go!"
"I owe you my life, ser."
"I’m no ser."
"Remove his hood."
"# On that eve, the captive Imp # Downwards from his horse did limp # No more would he preen and primp # In garb of red and gold # This isn’t the Kingsroad."
"You said we were riding for Winterfell."
"I did…"
"Often and loudly."
"Very wise."
"They’ll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place."
"Word’s probably gotten to my father by now."
"He’ll be offering a handsome reward."
"Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts."
"Would you be so good as to untie me?"
"And why would I do that?"
"Why not?"
"Am I going to run?"
"The hill tribes would kill me for my boots."
"Unless a shadowcat ate me first."
"Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns."
"Ah, the eastern road."
"We’re going to the Vale."
"You’re taking me to your sister’s to answer for my imagined crimes."
"Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister?"
"Five years ago."
"She’s changed."
"She was always a bit touched, but now…"
"You might as well kill me here."
"I am not a murderer, Lannister."
"Neither am I."
"I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son’s life."
"The dagger found…"
"What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?"
"Should I gag him?"
"Why?"
"Am I starting to make sense?"
"Rodrik!"
"My lady, this way."
"Untie me."
"If I die, what’s the point?"
"Ah!"
"Rodrik?"
"I’ll be fine, my lady."
"There’s no need to bloody yourself."
"Your first?"
"You need a woman."
"Nothing like a woman after a fight."
"I’m willing if she is."
"Bran."
"The Iron Islands."
"Sigil a kraken."
"Words “We do not sow."
"” Lords?"
"The Greyjoys."
"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
"And failed rebellions."
"Sigil a stag, a crowned stag now that Robert’s king."
"Good."
"Words “Ours is the fury."
"” Lords the Baratheons."
"Mmhm."
"The Westerlands."
"Sigil a lion."
"Mmm."
"Words “A Lannister always pays his debts."
"” No."
"A common saying, but not their official motto."
"Lords the Lannisters."
"We’re still on their words."
"I don’t know them."
"You do know them."
"Think."
"“Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."
"” That’s House Martell."
"“Righteous in wrath."
"” House Hornwood."
"“Family, duty, honour."
"” Those are Tully words your mother’s."
"Are we playing a game?"
"Family, duty, honour…"
"Is that the right order?"
"You know it is."
"Family comes first?"
"Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family."
"How can she protect the family if she’s not with her family?"
"Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept."
"And then she left!"
"When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother."
"I placed you in her arms."
"From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you."
"Absolutely."
"Fiercely."
"Why did she leave?"
"I still can’t tell you, but she will be home soon."
"Do you know where she is now?"
"Today?"
"No, I don’t."
"Then how can you promise me she’ll be home soon?"
"Sometimes I worry you’re too smart for your own good."
"I’ll never shoot another arrow."
"And where is that written?"
"You need legs to work a bow."
"Hmm."
"If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
"Really?"
"Dothraki boys learn when they’re four years old."
"Why shouldn’t you?"
"Shh, keep it down."
"You’re not supposed to be inside the castle walls."
"I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here."
"Important enough for the likes of you."
"You’re not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
"Who, the Imp?"
"I’d call him half a nobleman."
"Jealous?"
"Why should I be jealous?"
"Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night."
"What’s a dwarf like down below?"
"I’ve always wondered."
"Might surprise you."
"Hmm?"
"He’s good with his fingers too."
"And his tongue."
"Generous tipper."
"I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister."
"You are jealous."
"I’m a Greyjoy."
"We’ve been lords of the Iron Islands for years."
"There’s not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
"And what about the Starks?"
"I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old."
"A ward that’s a nice word for it."
"Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
"My father fought for the freedom of his people."
"What did your father do?"
"Fucked a cook and whelped a whore."
"You’re a very serious boy."
"I’m not a boy."
"Oh, yes, you are."
"A serious boy with a serious cock."
"I don’t want to pay for it."
"Then get yourself a wife."
"Come on."
"I’m not gonna hurt you."
"How is your son, my lord?"
"He’ll never walk again."
"But his mind is sound?"
"So they say."
"A blessing, then."
"I suffered an early mutilation myself."
"Some doors close forever…"
"others open in most unexpected places."
"May I?"
"If the wrong ears heard what I’m about to tell you, off comes my head."
"And who would mourn poor Varys then?"
"North or South, they sing no songs for spiders."
"But there are things you must know."
"You are the King’s Hand and the king is a fool your friend, I know, but a fool and doomed unless you save him."
"I’ve been in the capital a month."
"Why have you waited so long to tell me this?"
"I didn’t trust you."
"So why do you trust me now?"
"The queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely."
"There are few men of honour in the capital."
"You are one of them."
"I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
"What sort of doom does the king face?"
"The same sort as Jon Arryn."
"The tears of lys, they call it."
"A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water."
"It leaves no trace."
"Who gave it to him?"
"Some dear friend, no doubt."
"But which one?"
"There were many."
"Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man."
"There was one boy."
"All he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
"The squire, Ser Hugh?"
"Pity, what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
"If Ser Hugh poisoned him…"
"who paid Ser Hugh?"
"Someone who could afford it."
"Jon was a man of peace."
"He was Hand for years good years."
"Why kill him?"
"He started asking questions."
"He’s found one bastard already."
"He has the book."
"The rest will come."
"And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
"The gods alone know."
"The fools tried to kill his son."
"What’s worse they botched it."
"The wolf and the lion will be at each other’s throats."
"We will be at war soon, my friend."
"What good is war now?"
"We’re not ready."
"If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
"This Hand is not the other."
"We need time."
"Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born."
"You know what these savages are."
"“Delay,” you say."
"“Move fast,” I reply."
"This is no longer a game for two players."
"It never was."
"The first to arrive and the last to leave."
"I admire your industry."
"You do move quietly."
"We all have our qualities."
"You look a bit lonely today."
"You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening."
"First boy is on the house."
"I think you’re mistaking business with pleasure."
"Am I?"
"All those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things."
"Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
"Oh, I’m sure."
"Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
"I’m a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally important."
"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?"
"Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
"All desires are valid to a man with a full purse."
"And I heard the most awful rumour about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers."
"Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination."
"The logistics alone…"
"to find beautiful corpses before they rot."
"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the king’s laws."
"Strictly speaking."
"Tell me."
"Does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box?"
"I’ve often wondered."
"Do you know, I have no idea where they are."
"And we had been so close."
"But enough about me."
"How have you been since we last saw each other?"
"Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?"
"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
"Saw me with your own eyes?"
"Eyes I own."
"Council business."
"We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark."
"Everyone’s well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark’s wife."
"If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy’s life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion…"
"to think a simple word to the queen…"
"One shudders at the thought."
"Ooh."
"But you know something?"
"I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me."
"Have you?"
"Yes."
"Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
"Was that you under the bed?"
"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary…"
"Council business?"
"Of course, you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea."
"You’re from there yourself, after all."
"We’re friends, aren’t we, Lord Varys?"
"I’d like to think we are."
"So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the king might question my friend’s sympathies."
"To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right loyalty to the realm…"
"Oh, please."
"To find myself in a position where a simple word to the king…"
"What are you two conspiring about?"
"Well, whatever it is, you’d best hurry up."
"My brother is coming."
"To a small council meeting?"
"Disturbing news from far away."
"Hadn’t you heard?"
"Off with you."
"No begging."
"I’m not a beggar."
"I live here."
"D’you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?"
"I want to see my father."
"I want to fuck the queen, for all the good it does me."
"You want your father, boy?"
"He’s lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
"My father is Hand of the King!"
"I’m not a boy."
"I’m Arya Stark of Winterfell."
"And if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes."
"Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
"You know I had half my guard out searching for you?"
"You promised me this would stop."
"They said they were going to kill you."
"Who did?"
"I didn’t see them, but I think one was fat."
"Oh, Arya."
"I’m not lying!"
"They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage…"
"Something about the savage."
"Where did you hear this?"
"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
"What were you doing in the dungeons?"
"Chasing a cat."
"Pardon, my lord."
"There’s a night’s watchman here begging a word."
"Says it’s urgent."
"Your name, friend?"
"Yoren, if it please."
"This must be your son."
"He has the look."
"I’m a girl!"
"Did Benjen send you?"
"No one sent me, my lord."
"I’m here to find men for the Wall, see if there’s any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
"Oh, we’ll find recruits for you."
"Thank you, my lord."
"But that’s not why I disturb you now."
"Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black makes him as much my brother as yours."
"It’s for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse."
"There are others riding too."
"The whole city will know by tomorrow."
"Know what?"
"Best said in private, my lord."
"Go on."
"We’ll talk more later."
"Jory, take her safely to her room."
"Come along, my lady."
"You heard your father."
"How many guards does my father have?"
"Here in King’s Landing?"
"Fifty."
"You wouldn’t let anyone kill him, would you?"
"No fear on that count, little lady."
"Well?"
"It’s about your wife, my lord."
"She’s taken the Imp."
"You’re far from home, Lady Stark."
"To whom do I speak?"
"Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale."
"Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
"There was no time to send word."
"May I ask, my lady, why he is with you?"
"That’s why there was no time."
"He is my prisoner."
"He doesn’t look like a prisoner."
"My sister will decide what he looks like."
"Yes, my lady."
"She will at that."
"The Eyrie."
"They say it’s impregnable."
"Give me ten good men and some climbing spikes, I’ll impregnate the bitch."
"I like you."
"Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber."
"A meeting has been called."
"I need to see the king first alone."
"The king is at the small council meeting, my lord."
"He has summoned you."
"Is it about my wife?"
"No, my lord."
"I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
"The whore is pregnant."
"You’re speaking of murdering a child."
"I warned you this would happen, back in the North."
"I warned you, but you didn’t care to hear."
"Well, hear it now."
"I want ’em dead, mother and child both."
"And that fool Viserys as well."
"Is that plain enough for you?"
"I want them both dead."
"You will dishonour yourself forever if you do this."
"Honour?"
"!"
"I’ve got seven kingdoms to rule!"
"One king, seven kingdoms."
"Do you think honour keeps them in line?"
"Do you think it’s honour that’s keeping the peace?"
"It’s fear fear and blood."
"Then we’re no better than the Mad King."
"Careful, Ned."
"Careful now."
"You want to assassinate a girl because the spider heard a rumour?"
"No rumour, my lord."
"The princess is with child."
"Based on whose information?"
"Ser Jorah Mormont."
"He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens."
"Mormont?"
"You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?"
"Jorah Mormont’s a slaver, not a traitor."
"Small difference, I know, to an honourable man."
"He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land."
"We commit murder on the word of this man?"
"And if he’s right?"
"If she has a son?"
"A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army what then?"
"The Narrow Sea still lies between us."
"I’ll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water."
"Do nothing?"
"That’s your wise advice?"
"Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?"
"You’re my council."
"Counsel!"
"Speak sense to this honourable fool."
"I understand your misgivings, my lord."
"Truly, I do."
"It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing."
"Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm."
"Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
"I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die?"
"How many towns will burn?"
"Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
"We should have had them both killed years ago."
"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with."
"Cut her throat."
"Be done with it."
"I followed you into war twice, without doubts, without second thoughts."
"But I will not follow you now."
"The Robert I grew up with didn’t tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."
"She dies."
"I will have no part in it."
"You’re the King’s Hand, Lord Stark."
"You’ll do as I command or I’ll find me a Hand who will."
"And good luck to him."
"I thought you were a better man."
"Out."
"Out, damn you."
"I’m done with you."
"Go, run back to Winterfell!"
"I’ll have your head on a spike!"
"I’ll put it there myself, you fool!"
"You think you’re too good for this?"
"Too proud and honourable?"
"This is a war!"
"I’ll go ahead with my daughters."
"Get them ready."
"Do it yourself."
"Don’t ask anyone for help."
"Right away, my lord."
"Lord Baelish is here for you."
"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave."
"The word “treason” was mentioned."
"What can I do for you?"
"When do you return to Winterfell?"
"Why?"
"What do you care?"
"If you’re still here come nightfall, I’ll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill."
"If that sort of thing still interests you."
"I don’t have the time."
"It won’t take more than an hour."
"But as you please."
"Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls’ chambers."
"Who are your best two swords?"
"Heward and Wyl."
"Find them and meet me at the stables."
"You bring him here without permission?"
"You pollute my home with his presence?"
"Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing."
"You remember her, don’t you?"
"Isn’t he beautiful?"
"And strong too."
"Jon knew it."
"His last words were “The seed is strong."
"” He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be."
"Look at him, the lord of all the Vale."
"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me…"
"To stay away from them!"
"Not to bring one here!"
"Mummy…"
"is that the bad man?"
"It is."
"He’s little."
"He’s Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister."
"He killed your father."
"He murdered the Hand of the King!"
"Oh, did I kill him too?"
"I’ve been a very busy man."
"You will watch your tongue!"
"These men are knights of the Vale."
"Every one of them loved Jon Arryn."
"Every one of them would die for me."
"If any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do."
"You can’t hurt us."
"No one can hurt us here."
"Tell him, Mummy!"
"Tell him!"
"Shhshhshhshhshh, my sweet boy."
"He’s just trying to frighten us."
"Lannisters are all liars."
"No one will hurt my baby."
"Mummy…"
"I want to see the bad man fly."
"Perhaps you will, my little love."
"This man is my prisoner."
"I will not have him harmed."
"Ser Vardis, my sister’s guest is weary."
"Take him down below so he can rest."
"Introduce him to Mord."
"You go sleep, dwarf man."
"Sleep good, little dwarf man!"
"Lord Stark’s lucky he still has a head."
"Robert will rant for a few days, but he won’t do anything."
"He adores the man."
"You’re jealous."
"Are you sure this won’t hurt?"
"Only if I slip."
"And you’d prefer me like this?"
"Mmhm."
"If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
"I want you."
"My brother thinks that anyone who hasn’t been to war isn’t a man."
"He treats me as if I’m a spoilt child."
"Oh, and you’re not?"
"Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers?"
"How many wars have you fought in?"
"Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armour of yours?"
"Hold still."
"All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I’m not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
"You did vomit when that boy’s eye was knocked out in the melee."
"His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!"
"He shouldn’t have entered the melee if he didn’t know how to fight."
"Easy for you to say."
"Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman."
"It’s not a gift."
"No one gave it to me."
"I’m good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick."
"I could work at fighting all day, every day, I’d still never be as good as you."
"Yes, well, I guess we’ll never know."
"Everywhere?"
"Everywhere."
"So how did it end up?"
"The Targaryen girl will die?"
"It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is."
"Robert’s rather tasteless about it."
"Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
"It’s a shame he can’t muster the same enthusiasm for his wife."
"He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money."
"You have to give it to the Lannisters they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
"I have an outrageous amount of money."
"Not as much as the Lannisters."
"But a lot more than you."
"Robert’s threatening to take me hunting with him."
"Last time we were out there for two weeks."
"Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day, all so he can stick his spear into something’s flesh."
"Oh."
"But Robert loves his killing."
"And he’s the king."
"Hmm."
"How did that ever happen?"
"Because he loves his killing."
"And he used to be good at it."
"Do you know who should be king?"
"Be serious."
"I am."
"My father could be your bank."
"I’ve never fought in a war before, but I’d fight for you."
"I’m fourth in line."
"And where’s Robert in the line of royal succession?"
"Joffrey is a monster."
"Tommen is eight."
"Stannis?"
"Stannis has the personality of a lobster."
"He’s still my older brother."
"What are you doing?"
"!"
"Look at it."
"You cut me."
"It’s just blood."
"We’ve all got it in us."
"Sometimes a little spills."
"If you become king, you’re going to see a lot of this."
"You need to get used to it."
"Go on."
"Look."
"People love you."
"They love to serve you because you’re kind to them."
"They want to be near you."
"You’re willing to do what needs to be done, but you don’t gloat over it."
"You don’t love killing."
"Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst?"
"That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared?"
"You would be a wonderful king."
"I’m sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn’t work out."
"You seemed so good together."
"I’m glad I could do something to make you happy."
"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
"I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime."
"No."
"He’s not serious enough."
"I’ll say this for Ned Stark he’s serious enough."
"Hmm."
"Was it really worth it?"
"Losing him this way?"
"I don’t know."
"But I do know this if the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea…"
"we won’t be able to stop them."
"The Dothraki don’t sail."
"Every child knows that."
"They don’t have discipline."
"They don’t have armour."
"They don’t have siege weapons."
"It’s a neat little trick you do you move your lips and your father’s voice comes out."
"Is my father wrong?"
"Let’s say Viserys Targaryen lands with , Dothraki screamers at his back."
"We hole up in our castles."
"A wise move only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field."
"They leave us in our castles."
"They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can’t hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children."
"How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee king, their cowardly king hiding behind high walls?"
"When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all?"
"We still outnumber them."
"Which is the bigger number five or one?"
"Five."
"Five…"
"One."
"One army a real army united behind one leader with one purpose."
"Our purpose died with the Mad King."
"Now we’ve got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse."
"And everybody wants something different."
"Your father wants to own the world."
"Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
"What do you want?"
"We haven’t had a real fight in nine years."
"Backstabbing doesn’t prepare you for a fight."
"And that’s all the realm is now backstabbing and scheming and arselicking and moneygrubbing."
"Sometimes I don’t know what holds it together."
"Our marriage."
"Ah, so here we sit, years later, holding it all together."
"Don’t you get tired?"
"Every day."
"How long can hate hold a thing together?"
"Well, years is quite a long time."
"Yes, it is."
"Yes, it is."
"What was she like?"
"You’ve never asked about her, not once."
"Why not?"
"At first, just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her."
"I thought if I didn’t talk about her, she’d just fade away for you."
"When I realised that wasn’t going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite."
"I didn’t want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask."
"And eventually it became clear that my spite didn’t mean anything to you."
"As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
"So why now?"
"What harm could Lyanna Stark’s ghost do to either of us that we haven’t done to each other a hundred times over?"
"You want to know the horrible truth?"
"I can’t even remember what she looked like."
"I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted."
"Someone took her away from me, and seven kingdoms couldn’t fill the hole she left behind."
"I felt something for you once, you know?"
"I know."
"Even after we lost our first boy."
"For quite a while, actually."
"Was it ever possible for us?"
"Was there ever a time, ever a moment?"
"No."
"Does that make you feel better or worse?"
"It doesn’t make me feel anything."
"She looks like him, don’t she, my lord?"
"She has his nose, his black hair."
"Aye."
"Tell him when you see him, my lord."
"If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is."
"I will."
"And tell him I’ve been with no one else."
"I swear it, my lord, by the old gods and new."
"I don’t want no jewels or nothing, just him."
"The king was always good to me."
"When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
"He wasn’t that sort of man, my lord."
"He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
"Looks healthy enough to me."
"The girl shall want for nothing."
"Brothels make a much better investment than ships, I’ve found."
"Whores rarely sink."
"What do you know of King Robert’s bastards?"
"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
"How many?"
"Does it matter?"
"If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
"And Jon Arryn tracked them all down."
"Why?"
"He was the King’s Hand."
"Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after."
"He was overcome with fatherly love."
"Come."
"Jory!"
"My lord."
"Such a small pack of wolves."
"Stay back, ser."
"This is the Hand of the King."
"Was the Hand of the King."
"Now I’m not sure what he is lord of somewhere very far away."
"What’s the meaning of this, Lannister?"
"Get back inside where it’s safe."
"I’m looking for my brother."
"You remember my brother, don’t you, Lord Stark?"
"Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
"I remember him well."
"It seems he had some trouble on the road."
"You wouldn’t know what happened to him, would you?"
"He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes."
"My lords!"
"I’ll bring the City Watch."
"Come, Stark."
"I’d rather you die sword in hand."
"If you threaten my lord again…"
"Threaten?"
"As in, “I’m going to open your lord “from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
"You kill me, your brother’s a dead man."
"You’re right."
"Take him alive."
"Kill his men."
"Yah!"
"My brother, Lord Stark we want him back."
""
"S1E6"
"“Summoned to court to answer for the crimes “of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain."
"” Er…"
"“Arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown."
"” Poor Ned Stark."
"Brave man, terrible judgment."
"Attacking him was stupid."
"Lannisters…"
"don’t act like fools."
"Are you going to say something clever?"
"Go on, say something clever."
"Catelyn Stark took my brother."
"Why is he still alive?"
"Tyrion?"
"Ned Stark."
"One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
"Why is he still alive?"
"It wouldn’t have been clean."
"Clean."
"You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you."
"I could care less what anyone thinks of me."
"That’s what you want people to think of you."
"It’s the truth."
"When you hear them whispering “kingslayer” behind your back, doesn’t it bother you?"
"Of course it bothers me."
"A lion doesn’t concern himself with the opinions of the sheep."
"I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness."
"I’m giving you half of our forces , men."
"You will bring them to Catelyn Stark’s girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts."
"I didn’t realise you placed such a high value on my brother’s life."
"He’s a Lannister."
"He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he’s one of us."
"And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect."
"So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of…"
"No, that’s not an opinion."
"It’s a fact."
"If another house can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared."
"Your mother’s dead."
"Before long I’ll be dead."
"And you…"
"and your brother and your sister and all of her children."
"All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground."
"It’s the family name that lives on."
"It’s all that lives on."
"Not your personal glory, not your honour, but family."
"Do you understand?"
"Hmm."
"You’re blessed with abilities that few men possess."
"You’re blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms."
"And you’re still blessed with youth."
"And what have you done with these blessings, huh?"
"You’ve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings one a madman, the other a drunk."
"The future of our family will be determined in these next few months."
"We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years."
"Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did."
"I need you to become the man you were always meant to be."
"Not next year."
"Not tomorrow."
"Now."
"You’re in pain."
"I’ve had worse, my lady."
"Perhaps it’s time to go home."
"The South doesn’t seem to agree with you."
"I know the truth Jon Arryn died for."
"Do you, Lord Stark?"
"Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
"Has he done this before?"
"Jaime would have killed him."
"My brother is worth a thousand of your friend."
"Your brother…"
"or your lover?"
"The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for years to keep bloodlines pure."
"Jaime and I are more than brother and sister."
"We shared a womb."
"We came into this world together."
"We belong together."
"My son saw you with him."
"Do you love your children?"
"With all my heart."
"No more than I love mine."
"And they’re all Jaime’s."
"Thank the gods."
"In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways."
"In the morning, he doesn’t remember."
"You’ve always hated him."
"Hated him?"
"I worshipped him."
"Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath."
"And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and blackbearded, it was the happiest moment of my life."
"That night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine, and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, “Lyanna."
"” Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me."
"When the king returns from his hunt, I’ll tell him the truth."
"You must be gone by then you and your children."
"I will not have their blood on my hands."
"Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can."
"Because wherever you go, Robert’s wrath will follow you."
"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?"
"You should have taken the realm for yourself."
"Jaime told me about the day King’s Landing fell."
"He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up."
"All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself."
"Such a sad mistake."
"I’ve made many mistakes in my life…"
"but that wasn’t one of them."
"Oh, but it was."
"When you play the game of thrones, you win…"
"or you die."
"There is no middle ground."
"Come here."
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh!"
"Oh!"
"Oh, yes, yes, yes."
"Oh!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh!"
"No, no, no, no!"
"Is that what they teach you up in the North?"
"And you wherever you’re from do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?"
"Either of you understand a thing that I’m saying?"
"Yes, my lord."
"Let’s start over, shall we?"
"You be the man…"
"and you be the woman."
"Well, go ahead."
"Slowly."
"You’re not fooling them."
"They just paid you."
"They know what you are."
"They know it’s all just an act."
"Your job is to make them forget what they know."
"Now, that takes time."
"You need to…"
"ease into it."
"Go ahead."
"Ease into it."
"He’s winning you over in spite of yourself."
"You’re starting to like this."
"He wants to believe you."
"He’s enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it."
"Why shouldn’t you?"
"He knows he’s better than other men."
"He’s always known it deep down inside."
"Now he has proof."
"He’s so good, he’s reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature."
"Why don’t you join us, my lord?"
"I’m saving myself for another."
"What she doesn’t know won’t hurt her."
"A stupid saying."
"What we don’t know is usually what gets us killed."
"She must be very beautiful."
"No, not really."
"Impeccable bloodlines though."
"I do believe my lord’s in love."
"For many years."
"Most of my life, really."
"Play with her arse."
"And she loved me too."
"I was her little confidant, her plaything."
"She could tell me anything, anything at all."
"She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle that she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry a Northerner…"
"with a jaw like an anvil."
"So I challenged him to a duel."
"I mean, why not?"
"I’d read all the stories."
"The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories."
"In the end, she wouldn’t even let him kill me."
"“He’s just a boy,” she said."
"“Please don’t hurt him."
"” So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went."
"Is she still married to him?"
"Oh, no."
"He got himself killed before the wedding…"
"…"
"and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen."
"She loves him, I’m afraid."
"And why wouldn’t she?"
"I mean, who could compare to him?"
"He’s just so…"
"…"
"good."
"Do you know what I learned, losing that duel?"
"I learned that I’ll never win, not that way."
"That’s their game, their rules."
"I’m not going to fight them."
"I’m going to fuck them."
"That’s what I know."
"That’s what I am."
"And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want."
"And what do you want?"
"Oh, everything, my dear."
"Everything there is."
"Now wash yourselves."
"Both of you are working tonight."
"Hmm."
"You’re a very lucky girl."
"Do you know that?"
"Where I come from, we don’t show mercy to criminals."
"Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord…"
"at low tide we’d lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes."
"The sea would come in closer and closer."
"You’d see death creeping towards you a few inches at a time."
"Where is it you come from?"
"The Iron Islands."
"They far away?"
"You’ve never heard of the Iron Islands?"
"Trust me, you’ve never heard where I’m from neither."
"“Trust me, my lord."
"” You’re not living in the wilderness anymore."
"In civilised lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles."
"And what’s that?"
"Lord."
"Why?"
"Why?"
"What do you mean, why?"
"My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
"What’s that got to do with you?"
"If your father’s lord, how can you be lord too?"
"I will be lord after my father."
"So you’re not lord now?"
"No, you…"
"Are you having a go at me?"
"Is that it?"
"I just don’t understand how you southerners do things."
"I’m not a southerner."
"You’re from south of the Wall."
"That makes you a southerner to me."
"You’re an impudent little wench, aren’t you?"
"Couldn’t say, my lord."
"Don’t know what “impunent” means."
"Impudent."
"It means rude, disrespectful."
"Do you want to lose that chain?"
"Theon Greyjoy!"
"The lady is our guest."
"I thought she was our prisoner."
"Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?"
"Chances are I won’t be nearby the next time that happens."
"I’m used to worse than him."
"Hmm?"
"I’m used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones."
"Why did you come here?"
"Didn’t mean to come here."
"Meant to get much further south than this."
"As far south as south goes, before the long night comes."
"Why?"
"What are you afraid of?"
"There’s things that sleep in the day and hunt at night."
"Owls and shadowcats…"
"I’m not talking about owls and shadowcats."
"The things you speak of they’ve been gone for thousands of years."
"They wasn’t gone, old man."
"They was sleeping."
"And they ain’t sleeping no more."
"I miss girls."
"Not even talking to them."
"I never talked to them."
"Just looking at them, hearing them giggle."
"Don’t you miss girls?"
"Riders."
"The horn."
"We have to blow the horn."
"Why is he alone?"
"One blast for a ranger returning, two for wildlings, three for…"
"There’s no rider."
"Whoa, boy, whoa."
"That’s my Uncle Benjen’s horse."
"Where’s my uncle?"
"Ned!"
"It’s Robert."
"We were hunting…"
"a boar…"
"I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man."
"I was never meant to be a father."
"Go on."
"You don’t want to see this."
"My fault."
"Too much wine, missed my thrust."
"It stinks."
"It stinks like death."
"Don’t think I can’t smell it."
"I paid the bastard back, Ned."
"I drove my knife right through his brain."
"You ask ’em if I didn’t."
"Ask ’em!"
"I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw."
"And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me."
"Now leave us, the lot of you."
"I need to talk to Ned."
"Robert, my sweet…"
"Out, all of you!"
"You damned fool."
"Paper and ink on the table."
"Write down what I say."
"“In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, “first of…"
"” You know how it goes."
"Fill in the damn titles."
"“I hereby command “Eddard of House Stark…"
"” titles, titles…"
"“to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm “upon my death, “to rule in my stead “until my son Joffrey comes of age."
"” Give it over."
"Give it to the council…"
"after I’m dead."
"At least they’ll say I did this right, this one thing."
"You’ll rule now."
"You’ll hate it worse than I did…"
"but you’ll do it well."
"The girl…"
"Daenerys."
"You were right."
"Varys, Littlefinger, my brother…"
"worthless."
"No one to tell me “no” but you."
"Only you."
"Let her live."
"Stop it, if it’s not too late."
"I will."
"And my son…"
"help him, Ned."
"Make him better than me."
"I’ll…"
"I’ll do everything I can to honour your memory."
"My memory."
"King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig."
"Give me something for the pain and let me die."
"Give him milk of the poppy."
"He was reeling from the wine."
"He commanded us to…"
"step aside, but…"
"I failed him."
"No man could have protected him from himself."
"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
"His squire, from the king’s own skin."
"His squire?"
"The Lannister boy?"
"Such a dutiful boy to make sure His Grace did not lack refreshment."
"I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself."
"His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen."
"Whatever arrangements you made…"
"unmake them."
"At once."
"I’m afraid those birds have flown."
"The girl is likely dead already."
"The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs."
"According to the prophecy…"
"…"
"the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth."
"The earth ends at the black salt sea."
"No horse can cross the poison water."
"The earth does not end at the sea…"
"…"
"there are many dirts beyond the sea."
"The dirt where I was born."
"Not dirts."
"Lands."
"Lands, yes…"
"There are thousands of ships in the free cities."
"Wooden horses that fly across the sea…"
"Let’s speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs."
"It’s not a chair."
"It’s a…"
"…"
"throne."
"Throne."
"A chair for a King to sit upon, or…"
"…"
"a Queen."
"A King does not need a chair to sit upon."
"He only needs a horse."
"Can’t you help me make him understand?"
"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
"Have patience, Khaleesi."
"We will go home, I promise you."
"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
"Have I said something funny, ser?"
"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn’t seize six of the Kingdoms because they were his right."
"He had no right to them."
"He seized them because he could."
"And because he had dragons."
"Ah, well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
"You don’t believe it."
"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?"
"I believe what my eyes and ears report."
"As for the rest…"
"it was years ago."
"Who knows what really happened?"
"Now if you’ll pardon me, I’ll seek out the merchant captain, see if he has any letters for me."
"I’ll come with you."
"No, no, don’t trouble yourself."
"Enjoy the market."
"I’ll rejoin you soon enough."
"Psst!"
"Jorah the Andal."
"The Spider sends his greetings and his congratulations."
"A royal pardon."
"You can go home now."
"Sweet reds…"
"I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!"
"Tyroshi pear brandy!"
"Andalish sours!"
"I have them!"
"I have them!"
"A taste for the Khaleesi?"
"I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady."
"One taste and you’ll name your first child after me."
"My son already has his name, but I’ll try your summerwine."
"Just a taste."
"My lady, you are from Westeros."
"You have the honour of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Khaleesi of the Riding Men and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms."
"Princess."
"Rise."
"I’d still like to taste that wine."
"That?"
"Dornish swill."
"Not worthy of a princess."
"I have a dry red from the Arbor nectar of the gods."
"Let me give you a cask."
"A…"
"A gift."
"You honour me, ser."
"The honour…"
"the honour is all mine."
"Ahahahahah."
"You know, there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, Princess."
"I hope to repay your kindness someday."
"Rakharo."
"Put down that cask."
"Is something wrong?"
"I have a thirst."
"Open it."
"The wine is for the khaleesi."
"It’s not for the likes of you."
"Open it."
"Pour."
"It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe."
"Do as he says."
"As the princess commands."
"Sweet, isn’t it?"
"Can you smell the fruit, ser?"
"Taste it, my lord."
"Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue."
"You first."
"Me?"
"I’m afraid I am not worthy of the vintage."
"Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares."
"You will drink."
"Stop him!"
"Come."
"You came to us as outlaws…"
"…"
"poachers, rapers, killers, thieves."
"You came alone, in chains, without friends or honour."
"You came to us rich and you came to us poor."
"Some of you bear the names of proud Houses, others only bastard names or no names at all."
"It does not matter."
"All that is in the past."
"Here…"
"on the Wall…"
"we are all one House."
"Tonight…"
"You’re allowed to look happy."
"You’re going to be a ranger."
"Isn’t that what you always wanted?"
"I want to find my uncle."
"I know he’s alive out there."
"I know he is."
"I wish I could help you, but I’m no ranger."
"It’s the steward’s life for me."
"There’s honour in being a steward."
"Not much, really."
"But there’s food."
"Here…"
"you begin anew."
"A man of the Night’s Watch…"
"lives his life for the realm."
"Not for a king…"
"or a lord, or the honour of this House or that House, not for gold or glory, or a woman’s love, but for the realm and all the people in it."
"You’ve all learned the words of the vow."
"Think carefully before you say them."
"The penalty for desertion…"
"is death."
"You can take your vows here…"
"tonight…"
"at sunset."
"Do any of you still keep the old gods?"
"I do, my lord."
"You’ll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did."
"Yes, my lord."
"You’ll find a weirwood a mile north of the Wall."
"And your old gods too, maybe."
"My lord, might I go as well?"
"Does House Tarly keep the old gods?"
"No, my lord."
"I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him."
"Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?"
"The Night’s Watch is my House now."
"The Seven have never answered my prayers."
"Perhaps the old gods will."
"As you wish, lad."
"You’ve all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths."
"Halder to the builders."
"Pyp to the stewards."
"Toad to the builders."
"Grenn to the rangers."
"Samwell to the stewards."
"Matthar to the rangers."
"Dareon to the stewards."
"Balian to the rangers."
"Rast to the rangers."
"Jon to the stewards."
"Rancer to the builder."
"Echiel to the builders."
"Gordo to the stewards."
"Niko to the rangers."
"Escan to the rangers."
"Vorkoy to the builders."
"Joby to the stables."
"Mink to the kitchens."
"Allo to the builders."
"Nelugo to the rangers."
"May all the gods preserve you."
"Rangers with me."
"Builders!"
"Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library."
"Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens."
"Luke, report to OneEyed Joe in the stables."
"Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch."
"Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive."
"Make no comment about his nose."
"Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward."
"Will I serve the Lord Commander’s meals and fetch hot water for his bath?"
"Certainly."
"And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you."
"Do you take me for a servant?"
"We took you for a man of the Night’s Watch."
"But perhaps we were wrong in that."
"May I go?"
"As you wish."
"Jon, wait!"
"Don’t you see what they’re doing?"
"I see Ser Alliser’s revenge, that’s all."
"He wanted it and he got it."
"Stewards are nothing but maids!"
"I’m a better swordsman and rider than any of you!"
"It’s not fair."
"Fair?"
"I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock."
"I pushed him away and he said he’d have my hands cut off for stealing their silver."
"So now I’m here at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you."
"I’ll never see my family again."
"I’ll never be inside a woman again."
"So don’t tell me about fair."
"I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister."
"Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?"
"Could you sing me a song, Pyp?"
"I’d like to hear a song."
"Now listen to me."
"The old man is the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch."
"You’ll be with him day and night."
"Yes, you’ll clean his clothes."
"But you’ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle."
"You’ll know everything, be part of everything."
"And he asked for you himself."
"He wants to groom you for command."
"I just…"
"I always wanted to be a ranger."
"I always wanted to be a wizard."
"What?"
"No, I’m serious."
"So you’ll stay and say your words with me?"
"Lord Stark…"
"a moment."
"Alone, if you will."
"He named you Protector of the Realm."
"He did."
"She won’t care."
"Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command."
"And what should I do with a hundred swords?"
"Strike!"
"Tonight, while the castle sleeps."
"We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody."
"Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom."
"Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare."
"By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us."
"What about Stannis?"
"Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?"
"You have odd notions about protecting the realm."
"Stannis is your older brother."
"This isn’t about the bloody line of succession."
"That didn’t matter when you rebelled against the Mad King."
"It shouldn’t matter now."
"What’s best for the Kingdoms?"
"What’s best for the people we rule?"
"We all know what Stannis is."
"He inspires no love or loyalty."
"He’s not a king."
"I am."
"Stannis is a commander."
"He’s led men into war twice."
"He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet."
"Yes, he’s a good soldier."
"Everyone knows that."
"So was Robert."
"Tell me something."
"Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?"
"I will not dishonour Robert’s last hours by shedding blood in his halls…"
"and dragging frightened children from their beds."
"You will sail to Dragonstone tonight."
"You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon."
"Not his steward…"
"not his captain of the guard…"
"and not his wife."
"Only Stannis himself."
"Yes, my lord."
"Now leave us."
"My Lord Protector."
"The king has no trueborn sons."
"Joffrey and Tommen…"
"are Jaime Lannister’s bastards."
"So when the king dies…"
"The throne passes to his brother…"
"Lord Stannis."
"So it would seem."
"Unless…"
"There is no “unless”."
"He is the rightful heir."
"Nothing can change that."
"And he cannot take the throne without your help."
"You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds."
"Do you have a shred of honour?"
"You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm."
"All of the power is yours."
"You need only…"
"reach out and take it."
"Make peace with the Lannisters."
"Release the Imp."
"Wed your daughter to Joffrey."
"We’ve plenty of time to get rid of Stannis, and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead."
"We?"
"You’ll need someone to share these burdens, I assure you."
"My price would be modest."
"What you suggest is treason."
"Only if we lose."
"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say…"
"with the people who tried to murder my boy."
"We only make peace with our enemies, my lord."
"That’s why it’s called “making peace”."
"No."
"I won’t do it."
"So it will be Stannis and war?"
"There is no other choice."
"He is the heir."
"So why did you call me here?"
"Not for my wisdom, clearly."
"You promised Catelyn you would help me."
"The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard."
"I need the gold cloaks."
"The City Watch is , strong…"
"and sworn to defend the king’s peace."
"Look at you."
"You know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it’s not honourable, so…"
"the words stick in your throat."
"When the queen proclaims one king and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?"
"Who do they follow?"
"The man who pays them."
"Hear my words and bear witness to my vow."
"Night gathers and now my watch begins."
"It shall not end until my death."
"I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children."
"I shall wear no crowns and win no glory."
"I shall live and die at my post."
"I am the sword in the darkness."
"I am the watcher on the walls."
"I am the shield that guards the realms of men."
"I pledge my life and honour to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."
"You knelt as boys."
"Rise now as men of the Night’s Watch."
"Well done."
"Well done."
"What’s he got there?"
"To me, Ghost."
"Bring it here."
"Gods be good!"
"What will they do to him?"
"When the khalasar rides, he’ll be leashed to a saddle and forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can."
"And when he falls?"
"I saw a man last nine miles once."
"King Robert still wants me dead."
"This poisoner was the first."
"He won’t be the last."
"I thought he’d leave me alone now that my brother is gone."
"He will never leave you alone."
"If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you."
"If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him."
"He will never abandon the hunt."
"You’re a Targaryen the last Targaryen."
"Your son will have Targaryen blood with , riders behind him."
"He will not have my son."
"He will not have you either, Khaleesi."
"Moon of my life."
"Are you hurt?"
"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did."
"Choose any horse you wish, it is yours."
"I make this gift to you."
"And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world, I will also pledge a gift."
"I will give him the iron chair…"
"…"
"that his mother’s father sat upon."
"I will give him Seven Kingdoms."
"I, Drogo, will do this."
"I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends…"
"…"
"and ride wooden horses across the black salt water…"
"…"
"as no Khal has done before."
"I will kill the men in iron suits…"
"…"
"and tear down their stone houses."
"I will rape their women…"
"…"
"take their children as slaves…"
"…"
"and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak."
"This, I vow…"
"…"
"I, Drogo, son of Bharbo."
"I swear before the Mother of Mountains…"
"…"
"as the stars look down in witness."
"As the stars look down in witness."
"Lord Stark!"
"Stop!"
"No, all right."
"It’s all right."
"Let him through."
"Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room."
"King Joffrey?"
"King Robert is gone."
"The gods give him rest."
"All is accomplished."
"The City Watch is yours."
"Good."
"Is Lord Renly joining us?"
"I fear Lord Renly has left the city."
"He rode through the Old Gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some retainers."
"Last seen galloping south in some haste."
"We stand behind you, Lord Stark."
"All hail His Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
"I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation."
"I wish to be crowned within the fortnight."
"Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors."
"Ser Barristan…"
"I believe no man here could ever question your honour."
"King Robert’s seal unbroken."
"“Lord Eddard Stark is herein named…"
"“Protector of the Realm…"
"“to rule as regent…"
"“until the heir come of age."
"” May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?"
"Protector of the Realm."
"Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?"
"A piece of paper?"
"Those were the king’s words."
"We have a new king now."
"Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel."
"Allow me to return the courtesy."
"Bend the knee, my lord."
"Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son…"
"and we shall allow you to live out your days in the grey waste you call home."
"Your son has no claim to the throne."
"Liar!"
"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
"Ser Barristan, seize this traitor."
"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man."
"Do him no harm."
"You think he stands alone?"
"Kill him!"
"Kill all of them!"
"I command it!"
"Commander!"
"Take the queen and her children into custody."
"Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard."
"Men of the Watch!"
"I want no bloodshed."
"Tell your men to lay down their swords."
"No one needs to die."
"Now!"
"I did warn you not to trust me."
""
"S1E7"
"“Summoned to court to answer for the crimes “of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain."
"” Er…"
"“Arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown."
"” Poor Ned Stark."
"Brave man, terrible judgment."
"Attacking him was stupid."
"Lannisters…"
"don’t act like fools."
"Are you going to say something clever?"
"Go on, say something clever."
"Catelyn Stark took my brother."
"Why is he still alive?"
"Tyrion?"
"Ned Stark."
"One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
"Why is he still alive?"
"It wouldn’t have been clean."
"Clean."
"You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you."
"I could care less what anyone thinks of me."
"That’s what you want people to think of you."
"It’s the truth."
"When you hear them whispering “kingslayer” behind your back, doesn’t it bother you?"
"Of course it bothers me."
"A lion doesn’t concern himself with the opinions of the sheep."
"I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness."
"I’m giving you half of our forces , men."
"You will bring them to Catelyn Stark’s girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts."
"I didn’t realise you placed such a high value on my brother’s life."
"He’s a Lannister."
"He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he’s one of us."
"And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect."
"So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of…"
"No, that’s not an opinion."
"It’s a fact."
"If another house can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared."
"Your mother’s dead."
"Before long I’ll be dead."
"And you…"
"and your brother and your sister and all of her children."
"All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground."
"It’s the family name that lives on."
"It’s all that lives on."
"Not your personal glory, not your honour, but family."
"Do you understand?"
"Hmm."
"You’re blessed with abilities that few men possess."
"You’re blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms."
"And you’re still blessed with youth."
"And what have you done with these blessings, huh?"
"You’ve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings one a madman, the other a drunk."
"The future of our family will be determined in these next few months."
"We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years."
"Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did."
"I need you to become the man you were always meant to be."
"Not next year."
"Not tomorrow."
"Now."
"You’re in pain."
"I’ve had worse, my lady."
"Perhaps it’s time to go home."
"The South doesn’t seem to agree with you."
"I know the truth Jon Arryn died for."
"Do you, Lord Stark?"
"Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
"Has he done this before?"
"Jaime would have killed him."
"My brother is worth a thousand of your friend."
"Your brother…"
"or your lover?"
"The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for years to keep bloodlines pure."
"Jaime and I are more than brother and sister."
"We shared a womb."
"We came into this world together."
"We belong together."
"My son saw you with him."
"Do you love your children?"
"With all my heart."
"No more than I love mine."
"And they’re all Jaime’s."
"Thank the gods."
"In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways."
"In the morning, he doesn’t remember."
"You’ve always hated him."
"Hated him?"
"I worshipped him."
"Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath."
"And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and blackbearded, it was the happiest moment of my life."
"That night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine, and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, “Lyanna."
"” Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me."
"When the king returns from his hunt, I’ll tell him the truth."
"You must be gone by then you and your children."
"I will not have their blood on my hands."
"Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can."
"Because wherever you go, Robert’s wrath will follow you."
"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?"
"You should have taken the realm for yourself."
"Jaime told me about the day King’s Landing fell."
"He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up."
"All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself."
"Such a sad mistake."
"I’ve made many mistakes in my life…"
"but that wasn’t one of them."
"Oh, but it was."
"When you play the game of thrones, you win…"
"or you die."
"There is no middle ground."
"Come here."
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh!"
"Oh!"
"Oh, yes, yes, yes."
"Oh!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh, yes!"
"Oh!"
"No, no, no, no!"
"Is that what they teach you up in the North?"
"And you wherever you’re from do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?"
"Either of you understand a thing that I’m saying?"
"Yes, my lord."
"Let’s start over, shall we?"
"You be the man…"
"and you be the woman."
"Well, go ahead."
"Slowly."
"You’re not fooling them."
"They just paid you."
"They know what you are."
"They know it’s all just an act."
"Your job is to make them forget what they know."
"Now, that takes time."
"You need to…"
"ease into it."
"Go ahead."
"Ease into it."
"He’s winning you over in spite of yourself."
"You’re starting to like this."
"He wants to believe you."
"He’s enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it."
"Why shouldn’t you?"
"He knows he’s better than other men."
"He’s always known it deep down inside."
"Now he has proof."
"He’s so good, he’s reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature."
"Why don’t you join us, my lord?"
"I’m saving myself for another."
"What she doesn’t know won’t hurt her."
"A stupid saying."
"What we don’t know is usually what gets us killed."
"She must be very beautiful."
"No, not really."
"Impeccable bloodlines though."
"I do believe my lord’s in love."
"For many years."
"Most of my life, really."
"Play with her arse."
"And she loved me too."
"I was her little confidant, her plaything."
"She could tell me anything, anything at all."
"She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle that she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry a Northerner…"
"with a jaw like an anvil."
"So I challenged him to a duel."
"I mean, why not?"
"I’d read all the stories."
"The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories."
"In the end, she wouldn’t even let him kill me."
"“He’s just a boy,” she said."
"“Please don’t hurt him."
"” So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went."
"Is she still married to him?"
"Oh, no."
"He got himself killed before the wedding…"
"…"
"and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen."
"She loves him, I’m afraid."
"And why wouldn’t she?"
"I mean, who could compare to him?"
"He’s just so…"
"…"
"good."
"Do you know what I learned, losing that duel?"
"I learned that I’ll never win, not that way."
"That’s their game, their rules."
"I’m not going to fight them."
"I’m going to fuck them."
"That’s what I know."
"That’s what I am."
"And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want."
"And what do you want?"
"Oh, everything, my dear."
"Everything there is."
"Now wash yourselves."
"Both of you are working tonight."
"Hmm."
"You’re a very lucky girl."
"Do you know that?"
"Where I come from, we don’t show mercy to criminals."
"Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord…"
"at low tide we’d lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes."
"The sea would come in closer and closer."
"You’d see death creeping towards you a few inches at a time."
"Where is it you come from?"
"The Iron Islands."
"They far away?"
"You’ve never heard of the Iron Islands?"
"Trust me, you’ve never heard where I’m from neither."
"“Trust me, my lord."
"” You’re not living in the wilderness anymore."
"In civilised lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles."
"And what’s that?"
"Lord."
"Why?"
"Why?"
"What do you mean, why?"
"My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
"What’s that got to do with you?"
"If your father’s lord, how can you be lord too?"
"I will be lord after my father."
"So you’re not lord now?"
"No, you…"
"Are you having a go at me?"
"Is that it?"
"I just don’t understand how you southerners do things."
"I’m not a southerner."
"You’re from south of the Wall."
"That makes you a southerner to me."
"You’re an impudent little wench, aren’t you?"
"Couldn’t say, my lord."
"Don’t know what “impunent” means."
"Impudent."
"It means rude, disrespectful."
"Do you want to lose that chain?"
"Theon Greyjoy!"
"The lady is our guest."
"I thought she was our prisoner."
"Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?"
"Chances are I won’t be nearby the next time that happens."
"I’m used to worse than him."
"Hmm?"
"I’m used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones."
"Why did you come here?"
"Didn’t mean to come here."
"Meant to get much further south than this."
"As far south as south goes, before the long night comes."
"Why?"
"What are you afraid of?"
"There’s things that sleep in the day and hunt at night."
"Owls and shadowcats…"
"I’m not talking about owls and shadowcats."
"The things you speak of they’ve been gone for thousands of years."
"They wasn’t gone, old man."
"They was sleeping."
"And they ain’t sleeping no more."
"I miss girls."
"Not even talking to them."
"I never talked to them."
"Just looking at them, hearing them giggle."
"Don’t you miss girls?"
"Riders."
"The horn."
"We have to blow the horn."
"Why is he alone?"
"One blast for a ranger returning, two for wildlings, three for…"
"There’s no rider."
"Whoa, boy, whoa."
"That’s my Uncle Benjen’s horse."
"Where’s my uncle?"
"Ned!"
"It’s Robert."
"We were hunting…"
"a boar…"
"I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man."
"I was never meant to be a father."
"Go on."
"You don’t want to see this."
"My fault."
"Too much wine, missed my thrust."
"It stinks."
"It stinks like death."
"Don’t think I can’t smell it."
"I paid the bastard back, Ned."
"I drove my knife right through his brain."
"You ask ’em if I didn’t."
"Ask ’em!"
"I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw."
"And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me."
"Now leave us, the lot of you."
"I need to talk to Ned."
"Robert, my sweet…"
"Out, all of you!"
"You damned fool."
"Paper and ink on the table."
"Write down what I say."
"“In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, “first of…"
"” You know how it goes."
"Fill in the damn titles."
"“I hereby command “Eddard of House Stark…"
"” titles, titles…"
"“to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm “upon my death, “to rule in my stead “until my son Joffrey comes of age."
"” Give it over."
"Give it to the council…"
"after I’m dead."
"At least they’ll say I did this right, this one thing."
"You’ll rule now."
"You’ll hate it worse than I did…"
"but you’ll do it well."
"The girl…"
"Daenerys."
"You were right."
"Varys, Littlefinger, my brother…"
"worthless."
"No one to tell me “no” but you."
"Only you."
"Let her live."
"Stop it, if it’s not too late."
"I will."
"And my son…"
"help him, Ned."
"Make him better than me."
"I’ll…"
"I’ll do everything I can to honour your memory."
"My memory."
"King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig."
"Give me something for the pain and let me die."
"Give him milk of the poppy."
"He was reeling from the wine."
"He commanded us to…"
"step aside, but…"
"I failed him."
"No man could have protected him from himself."
"I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?"
"His squire, from the king’s own skin."
"His squire?"
"The Lannister boy?"
"Such a dutiful boy to make sure His Grace did not lack refreshment."
"I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself."
"His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen."
"Whatever arrangements you made…"
"unmake them."
"At once."
"I’m afraid those birds have flown."
"The girl is likely dead already."
"The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs."
"According to the prophecy…"
"…"
"the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth."
"The earth ends at the black salt sea."
"No horse can cross the poison water."
"The earth does not end at the sea…"
"…"
"there are many dirts beyond the sea."
"The dirt where I was born."
"Not dirts."
"Lands."
"Lands, yes…"
"There are thousands of ships in the free cities."
"Wooden horses that fly across the sea…"
"Let’s speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs."
"It’s not a chair."
"It’s a…"
"…"
"throne."
"Throne."
"A chair for a King to sit upon, or…"
"…"
"a Queen."
"A King does not need a chair to sit upon."
"He only needs a horse."
"Can’t you help me make him understand?"
"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
"Have patience, Khaleesi."
"We will go home, I promise you."
"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
"Have I said something funny, ser?"
"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn’t seize six of the Kingdoms because they were his right."
"He had no right to them."
"He seized them because he could."
"And because he had dragons."
"Ah, well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
"You don’t believe it."
"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?"
"I believe what my eyes and ears report."
"As for the rest…"
"it was years ago."
"Who knows what really happened?"
"Now if you’ll pardon me, I’ll seek out the merchant captain, see if he has any letters for me."
"I’ll come with you."
"No, no, don’t trouble yourself."
"Enjoy the market."
"I’ll rejoin you soon enough."
"Psst!"
"Jorah the Andal."
"The Spider sends his greetings and his congratulations."
"A royal pardon."
"You can go home now."
"Sweet reds…"
"I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!"
"Tyroshi pear brandy!"
"Andalish sours!"
"I have them!"
"I have them!"
"A taste for the Khaleesi?"
"I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady."
"One taste and you’ll name your first child after me."
"My son already has his name, but I’ll try your summerwine."
"Just a taste."
"My lady, you are from Westeros."
"You have the honour of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Khaleesi of the Riding Men and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms."
"Princess."
"Rise."
"I’d still like to taste that wine."
"That?"
"Dornish swill."
"Not worthy of a princess."
"I have a dry red from the Arbor nectar of the gods."
"Let me give you a cask."
"A…"
"A gift."
"You honour me, ser."
"The honour…"
"the honour is all mine."
"Ahahahahah."
"You know, there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, Princess."
"I hope to repay your kindness someday."
"Rakharo."
"Put down that cask."
"Is something wrong?"
"I have a thirst."
"Open it."
"The wine is for the khaleesi."
"It’s not for the likes of you."
"Open it."
"Pour."
"It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe."
"Do as he says."
"As the princess commands."
"Sweet, isn’t it?"
"Can you smell the fruit, ser?"
"Taste it, my lord."
"Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue."
"You first."
"Me?"
"I’m afraid I am not worthy of the vintage."
"Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares."
"You will drink."
"Stop him!"
"Come."
"You came to us as outlaws…"
"…"
"poachers, rapers, killers, thieves."
"You came alone, in chains, without friends or honour."
"You came to us rich and you came to us poor."
"Some of you bear the names of proud Houses, others only bastard names or no names at all."
"It does not matter."
"All that is in the past."
"Here…"
"on the Wall…"
"we are all one House."
"Tonight…"
"You’re allowed to look happy."
"You’re going to be a ranger."
"Isn’t that what you always wanted?"
"I want to find my uncle."
"I know he’s alive out there."
"I know he is."
"I wish I could help you, but I’m no ranger."
"It’s the steward’s life for me."
"There’s honour in being a steward."
"Not much, really."
"But there’s food."
"Here…"
"you begin anew."
"A man of the Night’s Watch…"
"lives his life for the realm."
"Not for a king…"
"or a lord, or the honour of this House or that House, not for gold or glory, or a woman’s love, but for the realm and all the people in it."
"You’ve all learned the words of the vow."
"Think carefully before you say them."
"The penalty for desertion…"
"is death."
"You can take your vows here…"
"tonight…"
"at sunset."
"Do any of you still keep the old gods?"
"I do, my lord."
"You’ll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did."
"Yes, my lord."
"You’ll find a weirwood a mile north of the Wall."
"And your old gods too, maybe."
"My lord, might I go as well?"
"Does House Tarly keep the old gods?"
"No, my lord."
"I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him."
"Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?"
"The Night’s Watch is my House now."
"The Seven have never answered my prayers."
"Perhaps the old gods will."
"As you wish, lad."
"You’ve all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths."
"Halder to the builders."
"Pyp to the stewards."
"Toad to the builders."
"Grenn to the rangers."
"Samwell to the stewards."
"Matthar to the rangers."
"Dareon to the stewards."
"Balian to the rangers."
"Rast to the rangers."
"Jon to the stewards."
"Rancer to the builder."
"Echiel to the builders."
"Gordo to the stewards."
"Niko to the rangers."
"Escan to the rangers."
"Vorkoy to the builders."
"Joby to the stables."
"Mink to the kitchens."
"Allo to the builders."
"Nelugo to the rangers."
"May all the gods preserve you."
"Rangers with me."
"Builders!"
"Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library."
"Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens."
"Luke, report to OneEyed Joe in the stables."
"Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch."
"Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive."
"Make no comment about his nose."
"Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward."
"Will I serve the Lord Commander’s meals and fetch hot water for his bath?"
"Certainly."
"And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you."
"Do you take me for a servant?"
"We took you for a man of the Night’s Watch."
"But perhaps we were wrong in that."
"May I go?"
"As you wish."
"Jon, wait!"
"Don’t you see what they’re doing?"
"I see Ser Alliser’s revenge, that’s all."
"He wanted it and he got it."
"Stewards are nothing but maids!"
"I’m a better swordsman and rider than any of you!"
"It’s not fair."
"Fair?"
"I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock."
"I pushed him away and he said he’d have my hands cut off for stealing their silver."
"So now I’m here at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you."
"I’ll never see my family again."
"I’ll never be inside a woman again."
"So don’t tell me about fair."
"I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister."
"Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?"
"Could you sing me a song, Pyp?"
"I’d like to hear a song."
"Now listen to me."
"The old man is the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch."
"You’ll be with him day and night."
"Yes, you’ll clean his clothes."
"But you’ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle."
"You’ll know everything, be part of everything."
"And he asked for you himself."
"He wants to groom you for command."
"I just…"
"I always wanted to be a ranger."
"I always wanted to be a wizard."
"What?"
"No, I’m serious."
"So you’ll stay and say your words with me?"
"Lord Stark…"
"a moment."
"Alone, if you will."
"He named you Protector of the Realm."
"He did."
"She won’t care."
"Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command."
"And what should I do with a hundred swords?"
"Strike!"
"Tonight, while the castle sleeps."
"We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody."
"Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom."
"Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare."
"By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us."
"What about Stannis?"
"Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?"
"You have odd notions about protecting the realm."
"Stannis is your older brother."
"This isn’t about the bloody line of succession."
"That didn’t matter when you rebelled against the Mad King."
"It shouldn’t matter now."
"What’s best for the Kingdoms?"
"What’s best for the people we rule?"
"We all know what Stannis is."
"He inspires no love or loyalty."
"He’s not a king."
"I am."
"Stannis is a commander."
"He’s led men into war twice."
"He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet."
"Yes, he’s a good soldier."
"Everyone knows that."
"So was Robert."
"Tell me something."
"Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?"
"I will not dishonour Robert’s last hours by shedding blood in his halls…"
"and dragging frightened children from their beds."
"You will sail to Dragonstone tonight."
"You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon."
"Not his steward…"
"not his captain of the guard…"
"and not his wife."
"Only Stannis himself."
"Yes, my lord."
"Now leave us."
"My Lord Protector."
"The king has no trueborn sons."
"Joffrey and Tommen…"
"are Jaime Lannister’s bastards."
"So when the king dies…"
"The throne passes to his brother…"
"Lord Stannis."
"So it would seem."
"Unless…"
"There is no “unless”."
"He is the rightful heir."
"Nothing can change that."
"And he cannot take the throne without your help."
"You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds."
"Do you have a shred of honour?"
"You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm."
"All of the power is yours."
"You need only…"
"reach out and take it."
"Make peace with the Lannisters."
"Release the Imp."
"Wed your daughter to Joffrey."
"We’ve plenty of time to get rid of Stannis, and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead."
"We?"
"You’ll need someone to share these burdens, I assure you."
"My price would be modest."
"What you suggest is treason."
"Only if we lose."
"Make peace with the Lannisters, you say…"
"with the people who tried to murder my boy."
"We only make peace with our enemies, my lord."
"That’s why it’s called “making peace”."
"No."
"I won’t do it."
"So it will be Stannis and war?"
"There is no other choice."
"He is the heir."
"So why did you call me here?"
"Not for my wisdom, clearly."
"You promised Catelyn you would help me."
"The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard."
"I need the gold cloaks."
"The City Watch is , strong…"
"and sworn to defend the king’s peace."
"Look at you."
"You know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it’s not honourable, so…"
"the words stick in your throat."
"When the queen proclaims one king and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?"
"Who do they follow?"
"The man who pays them."
"Hear my words and bear witness to my vow."
"Night gathers and now my watch begins."
"It shall not end until my death."
"I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children."
"I shall wear no crowns and win no glory."
"I shall live and die at my post."
"I am the sword in the darkness."
"I am the watcher on the walls."
"I am the shield that guards the realms of men."
"I pledge my life and honour to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."
"You knelt as boys."
"Rise now as men of the Night’s Watch."
"Well done."
"Well done."
"What’s he got there?"
"To me, Ghost."
"Bring it here."
"Gods be good!"
"What will they do to him?"
"When the khalasar rides, he’ll be leashed to a saddle and forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can."
"And when he falls?"
"I saw a man last nine miles once."
"King Robert still wants me dead."
"This poisoner was the first."
"He won’t be the last."
"I thought he’d leave me alone now that my brother is gone."
"He will never leave you alone."
"If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you."
"If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him."
"He will never abandon the hunt."
"You’re a Targaryen the last Targaryen."
"Your son will have Targaryen blood with , riders behind him."
"He will not have my son."
"He will not have you either, Khaleesi."
"Moon of my life."
"Are you hurt?"
"Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did."
"Choose any horse you wish, it is yours."
"I make this gift to you."
"And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world, I will also pledge a gift."
"I will give him the iron chair…"
"…"
"that his mother’s father sat upon."
"I will give him Seven Kingdoms."
"I, Drogo, will do this."
"I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends…"
"…"
"and ride wooden horses across the black salt water…"
"…"
"as no Khal has done before."
"I will kill the men in iron suits…"
"…"
"and tear down their stone houses."
"I will rape their women…"
"…"
"take their children as slaves…"
"…"
"and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak."
"This, I vow…"
"…"
"I, Drogo, son of Bharbo."
"I swear before the Mother of Mountains…"
"…"
"as the stars look down in witness."
"As the stars look down in witness."
"Lord Stark!"
"Stop!"
"No, all right."
"It’s all right."
"Let him through."
"Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room."
"King Joffrey?"
"King Robert is gone."
"The gods give him rest."
"All is accomplished."
"The City Watch is yours."
"Good."
"Is Lord Renly joining us?"
"I fear Lord Renly has left the city."
"He rode through the Old Gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some retainers."
"Last seen galloping south in some haste."
"We stand behind you, Lord Stark."
"All hail His Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
"I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation."
"I wish to be crowned within the fortnight."
"Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors."
"Ser Barristan…"
"I believe no man here could ever question your honour."
"King Robert’s seal unbroken."
"“Lord Eddard Stark is herein named…"
"“Protector of the Realm…"
"“to rule as regent…"
"“until the heir come of age."
"” May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?"
"Protector of the Realm."
"Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?"
"A piece of paper?"
"Those were the king’s words."
"We have a new king now."
"Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel."
"Allow me to return the courtesy."
"Bend the knee, my lord."
"Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son…"
"and we shall allow you to live out your days in the grey waste you call home."
"Your son has no claim to the throne."
"Liar!"
"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
"Ser Barristan, seize this traitor."
"Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man."
"Do him no harm."
"You think he stands alone?"
"Kill him!"
"Kill all of them!"
"I command it!"
"Commander!"
"Take the queen and her children into custody."
"Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard."
"Men of the Watch!"
"I want no bloodshed."
"Tell your men to lay down their swords."
"No one needs to die."
"Now!"
"I did warn you not to trust me."
""
"S1E8"
"Yah!"
"Left high, left low."
"Right low, lunge right."
"You break anything, the septa will have my head."
"What is…"
"Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today."
"How she could forget…"
"She didn’t forget."
"She’s with her dancing master."
"She’s with him every morning."
"She always comes back with scrapes and bruises."
"She’s so clumsy."
"Hush!"
"Go back to your room."
"Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know."
"What is it?"
"What’s happening?"
"Do as I told you."
"Run!"
"This way!"
"Left, right."
"Rah!"
"Now you are dead."
"You said right, but you went left."
"And now you are a dead girl."
"Only ’cause you lied."
"My tongue lied."
"My eyes shouted the truth."
"You were not seeing."
"I was so."
"I watched, but you…"
"Watching is not seeing, dead girl."
"The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay."
"Arya Stark, come with us."
"Your father wants to see you."
"And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?"
"I am wondering."
"Mind your place, dancing master."
"This is no concern of yours."
"My father wouldn’t send you."
"And I don’t have to go with you if I don’t want."
"Take her."
"Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?"
"Get out of my way, little man."
"I am Syrio Forel…"
"Foreign bastard."
"…"
"and you will be speaking to me with more respect."
"Kill the Braavosi."
"Bring the girl."
"Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day."
"Run to your father."
"Bloody oafs."
"Begone now, Arya."
"Come with me."
"Run."
"The first sword of Braavos does not run."
"What do we say to the god of death?"
"Not today."
"Go."
"Not today."
"Not today."
"Stay away from me."
"I’ll tell my father."
"I’ll…"
"I’ll tell the queen."
"Who do you think sent me?"
"Needle."
"There she is."
"What do you want?"
"I want you, wolf girl."
"Come here."
"Leave me be."
"My father’s a lord."
"He’ll reward you."
"She’ll reward me the queen!"
"Stay away!"
"Lord Stark, you must be thirsty."
"Varys."
"I promise you it isn’t poisoned."
"Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?"
"Not so much, my lord."
"I would save the rest, if I were you."
"Hide it."
"Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells."
"What about my daughters?"
"The younger one seems to have escaped the castle."
"Even my little birds cannot find her."
"And Sansa?"
"Still engaged to Joffrey."
"Cersei will keep her close."
"The rest of your household though…"
"all dead, it grieves me to say."
"I do so hate the sight of blood."
"You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing."
"And would again, my lord."
"I was unarmed, unarmoured and surrounded by Lannister swords."
"When you look at me do you see a hero?"
"What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey’s birth?"
"The madness of mercy."
"That she might save her children."
"Ah, the children."
"It’s always the innocents who suffer."
"It wasn’t the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar."
"The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king."
"I trust you know you’re a dead man, Lord Eddard?"
"The queen can’t kill me."
"Cat holds her brother."
"The wrong brother, sadly."
"And lost to her."
"Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers."
"If that’s true, then slit my throat and be done with it."
"Not today, my lord."
"Tell me something, Varys."
"Who do you truly serve?"
"The realm, my lord."
"Someone must."
"It’s Othor, without a doubt."
"The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off."
"Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?"
"Just these two, my lord."
"Been dead awhile, I’d say."
"Mmm."
"The smell."
"What smell?"
"There is none."
"If they’d been dead for a long time, wouldn’t there be rot?"
"We should burn them."
"Snow’s not wrong, my lord."
"Fire will do for them."
"The wildling way."
"I want Maester Aemon to examine them first."
"You may be a coward, Tarly, but you’re not stupid."
"Get them inside."
"You heard him."
"Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers…"
"A raven from King’s Landing."
"Come on, move ’em out."
"Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself."
"The king is dead."
"Is there any word of my father?"
"Sit."
"Lord Stark has been charged with treason."
"They say he conspired with Robert’s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey."
"I hope you’re not thinking of doing anything stupid."
"Your duty lies here now."
"My sisters were in King’s Landing too."
"I’m sure they’ll be treated gently."
"Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear."
"King Robert’s body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey’s rightful throne."
"He wouldn’t do that."
"He knows how much I love Joffrey."
"He wouldn’t."
"Please, Your Grace, there’s been a mistake."
"Send for my father."
"He’ll tell you the king was his friend."
"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong."
"We know that."
"Yet you are the daughter of a traitor."
"How can I allow you to marry my son?"
"A child born of a traitor’s seed is no fit consort for our king."
"She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in years who knows what treasons she may hatch?"
"No, I’m not."
"I’ll be a good wife to him, you’ll see."
"I’ll be a queen just like you, I promise."
"I won’t hatch anything."
"The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
"She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty."
"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what’s his name?"
"Robb."
"Word of your father’s arrest will reach him soon, no doubt."
"Best it comes from you."
"If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king’s peace."
"Tell him to come to King’s Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey."
"If…"
"If I could see my father, talk to him about…"
"You disappoint me, child."
"We have told you of your father’s treason."
"Why would you want to speak to a traitor?"
"I only meant that…"
"What will happen to him?"
"That depends."
"On…"
"On what?"
"On your brother."
"And on you."
"Treason?"
"Sansa wrote this?"
"It is your sister’s hand, but the queen’s words."
"You are summoned to King’s Landing to swear fealty to the new king."
"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?"
"This is a royal command, my lord."
"If you should refuse to obey…"
"I won’t refuse."
"His Grace summons me to King’s Landing, I’ll go to King’s Landing."
"But not alone."
"Call the banners."
"All of them, my lord?"
"They’ve all sworn to defend my father, have they not?"
"They have."
"Now we see what their words are worth."
"Yes."
"Are you afraid?"
"I must be."
"Good."
"Why is that good?"
"It means you’re not stupid."
"You’ve had this since dawn?"
"He sent it to me, not you."
"I’ve only shown it to you as a courtesy."
"A courtesy?"
"!"
"My husband has been taken prisoner."
"My son intends to declare war."
"A war?"
"Your son against the Lannisters?"
"You should go to him."
"Teach him patience."
"Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?"
"He is your brother by law!"
"Does family mean nothing to you?"
"Family means everything to me."
"And I will not risk Robin’s life to get caught up in another of your husband’s wars."
"I’m hungry."
"Hush now, darling."
"You just ate."
"You will not support us, then?"
"Do I understand you correctly?"
"But I’m hungry!"
"Soon, love, soon."
"You’re always welcome here, sister."
"But if you’re asking me to send men from the Vale to fight…"
"That is what I ask."
"Go on, sweet."
"Time for your bath."
"I’ll feed you after."
"If you fear for the safety of your son…"
"Of course I fear for the safety of my son!"
"Are you an idiot?"
"They killed my husband."
"You say they shoved your boy from a window."
"These people will do anything."
"And that is why we have to stop them."
"The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord."
"Will you shut up?"
"There’s hill tribes all around here."
"If I’m going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart."
"I should just take your food and leave you here."
"Eh?"
"What would you do then?"
"Starve, most likely."
"You don’t think I’d do it, do you?"
"What do you want, Bronn?"
"Gold?"
"Women?"
"Golden women?"
"Stick with me and you’ll have them all, for as long as I’m around and not a moment longer."
"But you knew that."
"That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honour."
"Fair enough."
"But don’t go looking for me to bend the knee and “my lord” you every time you take a shit."
"I’m not your toady and I’m not your friend."
"Though I would treasure your friendship, I’m mainly interested in your facility with murder."
"And if the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me out, remember this whatever their price, I’ll beat it."
"I like living."
"Tyrion."
"Tyrion."
"Tyrion."
"Come, share our fire."
"Help yourselves to our goat."
"When you meet your gods, you tell them Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you."
"I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister."
"How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?"
"In my own bed, at the age of with a belly full of wine and a girl’s mouth around my cock."
"Take the halfman."
"He can dance for the children."
"Kill the other one."
"No, no, no, no, no!"
"My…"
"My house is rich and powerful."
"If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold."
"We have no use for a halfman’s promises."
"Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies."
"What do the Stone Crows do?"
"Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?"
"Are those the best weapons you could steal?"
"Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don’t fight back."
"Lannister smiths shit better steel."
"You think you can win us over with your trinkets?"
"That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns."
"But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets."
"I will give you this."
"What is “this”?"
"The Vale of Arryn."
"The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes."
"The lords of the Vale want me dead."
"I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale."
"Now there’s a rare sight…"
"Not only a bastard, but a traitor’s bastard."
"Jon, no!"
"Jon, stop, put it down!"
"Blood will always tell."
"You’ll hang for this, bastard."
"I told you not to do anything stupid."
"You’re confined to quarters."
"Go."
"Ghost, what’s wrong?"
"Is someone out there?"
"Commander?"
"Stay."
"Hello?"
"Who’s there?"
"Lord Commander?"
"Snow?"
"Commander!"
"Move!"
"What did they do?"
"Lamb men make good slaves."
"Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold…"
"…"
"and silk, and steel."
"I thought the Dothraki didn’t believe in money."
"Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros."
"Jorah, make them stop."
"Khaleesi?"
"You heard me."
"These men have shed blood for their khal."
"Now they claim their rewards."
"She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi."
"The riders do her honour."
"If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue."
"Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it’s always been."
"I do not have a gentle heart, ser."
"Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why."
"Come."
"What do you want done with them?"
"Bring her to me."
"And those women there."
"You cannot claim them all, Princess."
"I can, and I will."
"Moon of my life, Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount."
"Tell me the truth of this."
"Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars."
"I have claimed many daughters this day…"
"…"
"so they cannot be mounted."
"This is the way of war."
"These women are slaves now…"
"…"
"to do with as we please."
"It pleases me to keep them safe."
"If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives."
"Does the horse mate with the lamb?"
"The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike."
"You are a foreigner."
"You do not command me."
"I am Khaleesi."
"I do command you."
"See how fierce she grows?"
"That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire."
"I will hear no more."
"Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock."
"A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal."
"I will not have your body burned."
"I will not give you that honour."
"The beetles will feed on your eyes."
"The worms will crawl through your lungs."
"The rain will fall on your rotting skin…"
"…"
"until nothing is left of you but bones."
"First you have to kill me."
"I already have."
"My sun and stars is wounded."
"A scratch…"
"…"
"moon of my life."
"Where are the healers?"
"This is the bite of a fly."
"I can help the great rider with his cut."
"The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep."
"She is mine."
"Let her speak."
"Thank you, silver lady."
"Who are you?"
"I am named Mirri Maz Duur."
"I was the godswife of this temple."
"Witch."
"My mother was godswife here before me."
"She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments."
"All men are of one flock, so my people believe."
"The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his…"
"Too many words."
"A witch’s words poison the ears."
"Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester."
"Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars…"
"…"
"it makes me hurt to see you bleed."
"For years I’ve been making corpses out of men, boy."
"I’m the man you want leading the vanguard."
"Galbart Glover will lead the van."
"The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover."
"I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home."
"You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber."
"And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker."
"Oathbreaker, is it?"
"!"
"I’ll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass."
"My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord."
"But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me."
"Your meat…"
"is bloody tough."
"What is it?"
"What’s happened?"
"Shh, it’s all right."
"Where are you going?"
"South."
"For Father."
"But it’s the middle of the night."
"The Lannisters have spies everywhere."
"I don’t want them to know we’re coming."
"They have more men than we do."
"Aye, they do."
"Can’t I come with you?"
"I can ride now."
"You’ve seen me riding."
"And I won’t get in the way, I…"
"There must always be a Stark at Winterfell."
"Until I return that will be you."
"You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone."
"Do you understand?"
"Listen to Maester Luwin."
"Look after your little brother."
"I will."
"I’ll send letters whenever I can, but if you don’t hear from me, don’t be scared."
"Until I return."
"How long have you been hiding out there?"
"Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye."
"They’ve all gone away."
"They’ll be back soon."
"Robb will free Father and they’ll come back with Mother."
"No, they won’t."
"Please watch over Robb."
"And watch over all the other men from Winterfell."
"And Theon too, I suppose."
"You hear them, boy?"
"The old gods are answering you."
"What are you doing here?"
"They’re my gods too."
"Beyond the Wall, they’re the only gods."
"Even slaves are allowed to pray."
"You’re not a slave."
"Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat."
"I’m not complaining, little lord, just telling truths."
"What did you mean about hearing the gods?"
"You asked them, they’re answering you."
"Shh."
"Open your ears."
"It’s only the wind."
"Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?"
"They see you, boy."
"They hear you."
"Your brother will get no help from them where he’s going."
"The old gods have no power in the South."
"The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago."
"How can they watch when they have no eyes?"
"Well, there’s a big man."
"He has giants’ blood in him or I’m the queen."
"Go back and find your clothes, Hodor."
"Go dress."
"Hodor."
"Are there really giants beyond the wall?"
"Giants and worse than giants."
"I tried telling your brother, he’s marching the wrong way."
"All these swords, they should be going north, boy."
"North, not south!"
"The cold winds are rising."
"They were touched by white walkers."
"That’s why they came back."
"That’s why their eyes turned blue."
"Only fire will stop them."
"How do you know that?"
"I read about it in a book…"
"a very old book in Maester Aemon’s library."
"What else did the book say?"
"The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years."
"And when they wake up…"
"And when they wake up, what?"
"I hope the Wall’s high enough."
"Summer snows, my lady."
"Robb’s brought the North with him."
"The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels."
"And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South."
"Our scouts confirm it’s even larger than the Kingslayer’s."
"One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts times as large."
"Mother!"
"You look well."
"Lady Catelyn, you’re a welcome sight in these troubled times."
"We had thought not to meet you here, my lady."
"I had not thought to be here."
"I would speak with my son alone."
"I know you will forgive me, my lords."
"You heard her!"
"Move your arses!"
"Come on, out."
"You too, Greyjoy."
"Are you bloody deaf?"
"Have no fear, my lady."
"We’ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister’s bunghole and then it’s on to the Red Keep to free Ned."
"You old devil, Rodrik."
"Jon."
"You’re not wasting away, are you?"
"I remember the day you came into this world, redfaced and squalling."
"And now I find you leading a host to war."
"There was no one else."
"No one?"
"Who were those men I saw here?"
"None of them are Starks."
"All of them are seasoned in battle."
"If you think you can send me back to Winterfell…"
"Oh, would that I could."
"There was…"
"a letter."
"From Sansa."
"From the queen, you mean."
"There’s no mention of Arya."
"No."
"How many men do you have?"
",."
"If I go to King’s Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey…"
"You would never be allowed to leave."
"No."
"Our best hope, our only hope, is that you can defeat them in the field."
"And if I lose?"
"Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children when the Mad King fell?"
"They were butchered in their sleep."
"On the orders of Tywin Lannister."
"And the years have not made him kinder."
"If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die."
"Well, that makes it simple, then."
"I suppose it does."
"From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone."
"Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin."
"Not best for me."
"If the halfman betrays us, Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood…"
"And feed it to the goats, yes."
"All right, then."
"Time to meet my father."
"Tyrion."
"Uncle."
"Father."
"The rumours of your demise were unfounded."
"Sorry to disappoint you."
"And who are these…"
"companions of yours?"
"This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows."
"Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men."
"This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears."
"And here we have Bronn, son of…"
"You wouldn’t know him."
"May I present my lord father, Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?"
"Kind of you to go to war for me."
"You left us no choice."
"The honour of the house was at stake."
"Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly."
"We have our differences, Jaime and I."
"He’s braver."
"I’m betterlooking."
"He’s been covering himself in glory."
"Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark’s homeland."
"And the Starks?"
"Lord Eddard?"
"Is our hostage."
"He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell."
"How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?"
"Robert Baratheon is dead."
"Joffrey rules in King’s Landing."
"My sister rules, you mean."
"Stark’s son has called his banners."
"He moves south with a strong host."
"A green boy."
"One taste of battle and he’ll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs."
"Maybe."
"Though the boy does have a certain belligerence."
"You’d like him."
"While we’re on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts."
"We shall require , helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces…"
"If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck."
"The wolf rushes into the lion’s jaws."
"So be it."
"Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly."
"And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark."
"At once, my lord."
"It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors."
"Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more."
"Only if the halfman fights with us."
"Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion’s life is ours."
"The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north."
"We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage."
"No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister’s siege of Riverrun."
"Do that and the river lords will join us."
"To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins."
"Lord Frey controls that bridge."
"Your father’s bannerman."
"“The late Lord Frey” my father calls him."
"At the Trident, he didn’t appear until the battle was done."
"Some men take their oaths more seriously than others."
"Robb’s right."
"We need that bridge."
"So what’s it going to be?"
"Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?"
"Your pardon, my lords."
"We’ve captured a Lannister scout."
"Don’t worry, lad."
"He won’t be leaving this tent with his head."
"Where did you find him?"
"In the brush above the encampment."
"He looked to be counting."
"How high did you get?"
",."
"Maybe more."
"You don’t have to do this yourself."
"Your father would understand…"
"My father understands mercy, when there is room for it."
"And he understands honour…"
"and courage."
"Let him go."
"Robb."
"Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him."
", northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold."
"Yes, my lord."
"Thank you, my lord."
"Are you touched, boy?"
"!"
"Letting him go?"
"You call me boy again."
"Go on."
"Oi."
"It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch…"
"Ser Aron."
"…"
"be at once raised to the rank of lord…"
"Lord Gyles."
"…"
"and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honour after him until the end of time."
"In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King."
"Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance."
"Ser Barristan Selmy."
"Your Grace, I am yours to command."
"Rise, Ser Barristan."
"You may remove your helm."
"You have served the realm long and faithfully."
"Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks."
"But it is time to put aside your armour and your sword."
"It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service."
"Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood."
"Our vows are taken for life."
"Only death relieves us of our sacred trust."
"Whose death, Ser Barristan?"
"Yours or your king’s?"
"You let my father die."
"You’re too old to protect anybody."
"Your Grace…"
"The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard."
"The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!"
"Careful, ser."
"We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser."
"You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need."
"A hall to die in and men to bury me."
"I am a knight."
"I shall die a knight."
"A naked knight, apparently."
"Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!"
"Here, boy!"
"Melt it down and add it to the others."
"If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence."
"Your Grace."
"Come forward, my lady."
"The Lady Sansa of House Stark."
"Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?"
"I do."
"As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King."
"Treason is a noxious weed."
"It should be torn out, root…"
"Let her speak."
"I want to hear what she says."
"Thank you, Your Grace."
"Do you deny your father’s crime?"
"No, my lords."
"I know he must be punished."
"All I ask is mercy."
"I know my lord father must regret what he did."
"He was King Robert’s friend and he loved him."
"You all know he loved him."
"He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him."
"They must have lied to him Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody."
"They must have lied!"
"He said I wasn’t the king."
"Why did he say that?"
"He was badly hurt."
"Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy."
"He wasn’t himself."
"Otherwise he never would have said it."
"A child’s faith."
"Such sweet innocence."
"And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes."
"Treason is treason!"
"Anything else?"
"If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace."
"Your sweet words have moved me."
"But your father has to confess."
"He has to confess and say that I’m the king…"
"or there’ll be no mercy for him."
"He will."
""
"S1E9"
"You’ve seen better days, my lord."
"Another visit?"
"It seems you’re my last friend."
"No, no, many still love you."
"Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
"On her knees begging for me."
"Hm!"
"Did you laugh with the others?"
"You do me wrong, my lord."
"Your blood is the last thing I want."
"I don’t know what you want."
"I’ve given up trying to guess."
"When I was still a boy before they cut my balls off with a hot knife I travelled with a group of actors through the free cities."
"They taught me that each man has a role to play."
"The same is true at court."
"I am the master of whisperers."
"My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples."
"I’m a good actor, my lord."
"Huh."
"Can you free me from this pit?"
"I could."
"But will I?"
"No."
"As I said, I’m no hero."
"What do you want?"
"Tell me."
"No riddles, no stories…"
"Tell me, what do you want?"
"Peace."
"Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northmen?"
"Loyal lad."
"Fighting for his father’s freedom."
"Robb?"
"He’s just a boy."
"Boys have been conquerors before."
"But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king’s…"
"the late king’s brother."
"Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne."
"He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy."
"Stannis Baratheon is Robert’s true heir."
"The throne is his by rights."
"Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life."
"It would be a shame to throw it away."
"Cersei is no fool."
"She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one."
"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
"I want you to serve the realm!"
"Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir."
"Cersei knows you as a man of honour."
"If you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
"You think my life is some precious thing to me?"
"That I would trade my honour for a few more years of…"
"Of what?"
"You grew up with actors."
"You learned their craft and you learnt it well."
"But I grew up with soldiers."
"I learned how to die a long time ago."
"Pity."
"Such a pity."
"What of your daughter’s life, my lord?"
"Is that a precious thing to you?"
"It’s a birthday message to his grandniece Walda."
"Or so Walder Frey would have you think."
"Keep shooting them down."
"We can’t risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters."
"He’s Grandfather’s bannerman."
"We can’t expect his support?"
"Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you’ll never be surprised."
"Look."
"Father rots in a dungeon."
"How long before they take his head?"
"We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now."
"Just march up to his gates and tell him you’re crossing."
"We’ve got five times his numbers."
"You can take the Twins if you have to."
"Not in time."
"Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak."
"The Freys have held the crossing for years, and for years they have never failed to exact their toll."
"Have my horse saddled and ready."
"Enter the Twins alone and he’ll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes."
"Or throw you in a dungeon."
"Or slit your throat."
"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing."
"Whatever it took."
"If I’m going to lead this army, I can’t have other men doing my bargaining for me."
"I agree."
"I’ll go."
"You can’t!"
"I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl."
"He would never harm me."
"Unless there was a profit in it."
"What do you want?"
"It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
"Oh, spare me."
"Your boy’s too proud to come before me himself."
"What am I supposed to do with you?"
"Father, you forget yourself."
"Lady Stark is here…"
"Who asked you?"
"You’re not Lord Frey yet, not until I die."
"Do I look dead to you?"
"Father, please…"
"I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?"
"Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn’t squirted you into her belly."
"All right, you come forward."
"There."
"Now that I’ve observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honour of shutting their mouths."
"Is there somewhere we can talk?"
"We’re talking right now."
"Fine."
"Out!"
"All of you!"
"Oh!"
"You too."
"You see that?"
"Fifteen, she is."
"A little flower."
"And her honey’s all mine."
"I’m sure she will give you many sons."
"Huh."
"Your father didn’t come to the wedding."
"He is quite ill, my lord."
"Huh."
"Didn’t come to the last one, either."
"Or the one before that."
"Your family has always pissed on me."
"My lord, I…"
"Don’t deny it."
"You know it’s true."
"The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine."
"I’m sure there were reasons…"
"I didn’t need reasons."
"I needed to get rid of sons and daughters."
"You see how they pile up?"
"Why are you here?"
"To ask you…"
"to open your gates, my lord…"
"so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
"Why should I let him?"
"If you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has , men outside your walls."
"They’ll be , corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here."
"Don’t try and frighten me, Lady Stark."
"Your husband’s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son’s got no fur to keep his balls warm."
"You swore an oath to my father."
"Oh, yes, I said some words."
"And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right."
"Joffrey’s king now, which makes your boy and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels, it seems to me."
"If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I’d hand you both over to the Lannisters."
"Why don’t you?"
"Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon."
"Give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you?"
"And…"
"engage!"
"When does Aemon think you’ll be able to use that hand?"
"Soon, he says."
"Good."
"You’ll be ready for this, then."
"I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear…"
"so I had a new pommel made."
"It’s called Longclaw."
"Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think."
"This is Valyrian steel."
"It was my father’s sword, his father before him."
"The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries."
"It was meant for my son Jorah."
"He brought dishonour to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
"My lord, you honour me, but I can’t…"
"Oh, you can."
"And you will."
"I wouldn’t be standing here if it wasn’t for you and your beast."
"A bloody dead man tried to kill me."
"So you’ll take it."
"I’ll hear no more about it."
"Is that understood?"
"Yes, my lord."
"Right."
"Now, don’t think this means I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne."
"That’s a man’s sword."
"It’ll take a man to wield it."
"I’ll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight."
"No, you won’t."
"I sent him to King’s Landing yesterday."
"The hand that your wolf tore off that thing’s wrist…"
"I’ve, uh, ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this…"
"boy king."
"That should get young Joffrey’s attention."
"And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne."
"Now go and put your sword somewhere safe…"
"and bring me my supper."
"Yes, my lord."
"Well done."
"Well done."
"You earned that, Snow."
"Well done."
"Go on, let’s have a look."
"At what?"
"The sword!"
"Show us the sword."
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Sword!"
"Let’s have a look."
"Piss off."
"Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light."
"Give it here!"
"What is it?"
"I…"
"Look at its eyes."
"Give it."
"I can’t."
"You can’t what?"
"I…"
"I’m really not supposed to say."
"And yet you really want to say."
"You want to say that?"
"There was a raven."
"I read the message to Maester Aemon."
"It’s your brother Robb."
"What?"
"What about him?"
"He’s heading south."
"To war."
"All his bannermen have rallied to his side."
"They’ll keep him safe."
"I should be there."
"I should be with him."
"If we do that, they’ll never get back across."
"Well?"
"What did he say?"
"Lord Walder has granted your crossing."
"His men are yours, as well."
"Huh."
"Less the he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you."
"What does he want in return?"
"You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire."
"He expects a knighthood in good time."
"Fine, fine."
"And?"
"And Arya…"
"will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age."
"She won’t be happy about that."
"Hm."
"And?"
"And…"
"when the fighting is done…"
"you will marry one of his daughters."
"Whichever you prefer."
"He has a number he thinks will be…"
"suitable."
"I see."
"Did you get a look at his daughters?"
"I did."
"And?"
"One was…"
"Do you consent?"
"Can I refuse?"
"Not if you want to cross."
"Then I consent."
"Sam said you wanted to see me?"
"I did indeed."
"Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me."
"Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night’s Watch take no wives and father no children?"
"No."
"So they will not love."
"Love is the death of duty."
"If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose…"
"between honour on the one hand…"
"and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
"He…"
"He would do whatever was right."
"No matter what."
"Then Lord Stark is one man in ,."
"Most of us are not so strong."
"What is honour…"
"compared to a woman’s love?"
"And what is duty…"
"against the feel of a newborn son in your arms?"
"Or a brother’s smile?"
"Sam told you."
"We’re all human."
"Oh, we all do our duty when there’s no cost to it."
"Honour comes easy then."
"Yet…"
"sooner or later…"
"in every man’s life…"
"there comes a day when it is not easy."
"A day when he must choose."
"And this is my day?"
"Is that what you’re saying?"
"Oh, it hurts, boy."
"Oh, yes."
"I know."
"You do not know."
"No one knows."
"I may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
"The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows."
"They waited till I was old."
"What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South…"
"the ruin of my House, the death of my family?"
"I was helpless…"
"blind, frail."
"But…"
"when I heard they had killed my brother’s son…"
"and his poor son…"
"and the children!"
"Even the little children."
"Who are you?"
"My father was Maekar, the first of his name."
"My brother Aegon reigned after him…"
"when I had refused the throne."
"And he was followed by his son Aerys…"
"whom they called the Mad King."
"You’re Aemon Targaryen."
"I’m a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night’s Watch."
"I will not tell you…"
"to stay or go."
"You must make that choice yourself…"
"and live with it for the rest of your days."
"As I have."
"My lord…"
"My sun and stars…"
"Drogo."
"My horse…"
"Blood of my blood…"
"No, I must ride."
"He fell from his horse."
"A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal."
"He’s tired, that’s all."
"He needs to rest."
"We’ve ridden far enough today."
"We’ll camp here."
"This is no place to camp."
"A woman does not give us orders."
"Not even a Khaleesi."
"We’ll camp here."
"Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it."
"You do not command me Khaleesi."
"Find Mirri Maz Duur."
"Bring her to me."
"The witch?"
"I’ll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
"Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me."
"Hyah!"
"Hyah!"
"Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey’s levies in tow."
"They’re a day’s march north."
"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless…"
"provincial courage."
"Ah."
"Oh, do continue."
"Didn’t mean to interrupt."
"I do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we’ve wasted good steel on them."
"The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes."
"Heavy black steel, doublesided."
"Shagga likes axes."
"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
"The vanguard?"
"Mmhm."
"Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?"
"They do seem rather ferocious."
"Ferocious?"
"Last night…"
"a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage."
"Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat."
"Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man’s cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
"Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort."
"There’ll be no more discussion on the matter."
"It appears I’m not hungry after all."
"Excuse me, my lords."
"Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?"
"I took her."
"Took her?"
"From whom?"
"From, uh…"
"Ser…"
"What’s his name?"
"I don’t know."
"Ginger cunt, three tents down."
"And he didn’t have anything to say about it?"
"He said something."
"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically."
"We’ll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
"Oh, well."
"I, uh…"
"think I’ll go and find myself one."
"Who are you?"
"Who would you like me to be?"
"What did your mother call you?"
"Shae."
"What did your mother call you?"
"My mother died giving birth to me."
"Is that why I’m here?"
"So we can talk about our mothers?"
"What sort of accent is that?"
"Foreign."
"For…"
"What do you want from me?"
"What do I want from you?"
"I want you to share my tent."
"I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they’re sore after a day’s ride."
"I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we’re together."
"And I want you to fuck me like it’s my last night in this world."
"Which it may well be."
"And what do I get?"
"One safety."
"No one will hurt you for as long as you’re mine."
"Two the pleasure of my company, which I have heard is spectacular."
"Who told you this?"
"Women you paid?"
"And three…"
"more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years."
"Do you accept my proposal?"
"Let’s start with your last night in this world."
"Khaleesi."
"Come."
"He’s very strong."
"No one understands how strong he is."
"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
"He can’t."
"He can’t."
"I won’t let him."
"Even a queen doesn’t have that power."
"We must go quickly."
"I’ve heard there’s a good port in Asshai."
"I won’t leave him."
"He’s already gone, Khaleesi."
"Doth…"
"Even if…"
"Even if he dies…"
"why would I run?"
"I am khaleesi, and my…"
"my son will be khal after Drogo."
"This isn’t Westeros, where men honour blood."
"Here they only honour strength."
"There will be fighting after Drogo dies."
"Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal."
"He won’t want any rivals."
"Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
"I won’t…"
"leave him."
"The wound has festered."
"You did this witch."
"Stop it!"
"I don’t want her hurt."
"No?"
"No?"
"You don’t want her hurt?"
"Pray we don’t hurt you, too."
"You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
"Rein in your tongue."
"She is still your Khaleesi."
"Only while the blood of my blood lives."
"When he dies, she is nothing."
"I have never been nothing."
"I am the blood of the dragon."
"The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi."
"I think you should wear your armour tonight, ser."
"I think you’re right."
"You’ve saved me once more."
"And now you must save him."
"He’s beyond the healer’s skills."
"All I can do is ease his path."
"Save him and I will free you."
"I swear it."
"You must know a way."
"Some…"
"Some magic."
"There is a spell."
"Some would say death is cleaner."
"Do it."
"Save him."
"There is a price."
"You’ll have gold, whatever you want."
"It’s not a matter of gold."
"This is bloodmagic."
"Only death pays for life."
"My death?"
"No, not your death, Khaleesi."
"Bring me his horse."
"Khaleesi, do not do this thing."
"Let me kill this witch."
"Kill her and you kill your khal."
"This is bloodmagic."
"It is forbidden."
"I am your khaleesi."
"I tell you what is forbidden."
"Go."
"Now."
"Take her and leave."
"Uhuh."
"Take her!"
"You must go also, lady."
"Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent."
"The dead will dance here tonight."
"No one will enter."
"Bring him back to me."
"What have you done?"
"I have to save him."
"We could have been miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai."
"You would have been safe."
"This must not be."
"This must be."
"Witch."
"No, you can’t."
"Khaleesi!"
"No further, horselord."
"Are you hurt?"
"The baby…"
"Hmm?"
"…"
"is coming."
"Fetch the midwives."
"They will not come."
"They say she is cursed."
"They’ll come or I’ll have their heads."
"The witch she can bring baby."
"I hear her say so."
"Are you in agony, my lion?"
"No."
"You look like you’re in agony."
"The fire is burning your pretty soft skin."
"Ah!"
"Damn you, woman."
"Are you immune to pain?"
"Just used to it."
"Drink."
"Let’s play a new game."
"There’s a Braavosi knife game I could teach you."
"Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?"
"Not if you win."
"No!"
"No fire games, no knife games."
"Let’s do something I’m good at."
"What are you good at?"
"I happen to be a great judge of character."
"This sounds like a boring game."
"It’s not."
"Here’s how it works I make a statement about your past."
"If I’m right, you drink."
"If I’m wrong, I drink."
"And no lying."
"I’ll know if you’re lying."
"I don’t want to play this game."
"Fine."
"Bronn first."
"Your father beat you."
"But my mother hit harder."
"You killed your first man before you were ."
"It was a woman."
"She swung an axe at me."
"You’ve been north of the Wall."
"What brought you up there?"
"Work."
"And…"
"you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you’ve never let yourself love again."
"Oh, wait, that’s me."
"Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
"I don’t want to play."
"It’s fun!"
"Look at the fun we’re having."
"Your mother was a whore."
"Drink."
"All right."
"Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
"Drink."
"And we’ve established the rules about lying?"
"Drink!"
"Mm."
"You wanted a different life."
"You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere."
"The whole shitstained world could drink off that one."
"So, specifics…"
"You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there?"
"I don’t believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you."
"So…"
"what’s a lowborn girl to do?"
"Drink."
"Are you sure…"
"Drink!"
"And don’t talk about my mother and father ever, or I will carve your eyes from your head."
"My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologise."
"My turn."
"Fine, fine."
"Ask away."
"Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
"Who were you in love with?"
"That’s not how the game works."
"I don’t care the way the game works."
"Our lord here used to be married."
"Married?"
"How did you hear that?"
"You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers."
"Another night, perhaps."
"Not another night."
"This night."
"It’s not a pleasant story."
"Oh, maybe I will cry."
"I’m guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship."
"So…"
"I was ."
"My brother Jaime and I were riding, when we heard a scream."
"She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels."
"Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak."
"She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her."
"Her name was Tysha."
"She was a wheelwright’s orphan."
"And she was hungry."
"Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine."
"Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine."
"I forgot how afraid I was around girls…"
"how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or…"
"look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother."
"I forgot about everything but Tysha."
"And somehow I found myself in her bed."
"For three chickens, I should hope so."
"It didn’t last long."
"I didn’t know what the hell I was doing."
"But she was good to me."
"She kissed me afterwards and…"
"sang me a song."
"And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand."
"A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife."
"For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
"Well, I imagine that was the end of all that."
"Not quite."
"First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth."
"The girl was a whore, you see."
"Jaime had arranged the whole thing the road, the rapers…"
"all of it."
"He thought it was time I had a woman."
"After my brother confessed…"
"my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards."
"He paid her well a silver for each man."
"How many whores command that kind of price?"
"He brought me into the barracks and made me watch."
"By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
"I would have killed the man who did that to me."
"You should have known she was a whore."
"Really?"
"I was , drunk and in love."
"A girl who was almost raped doesn’t invite another man into her bed two hours later."
"As I said, I was young and stupid."
"You are still young and stupid."
"Hyah!"
"What is it?"
"What do you want?"
"You’re sleeping through the war."
"What?"
"They stole a night’s march on us."
"They’re a mile north."
"Get my squire!"
"You don’t have a squire."
"If I die, weep for me."
"You’ll be dead."
"How will you know?"
"I’ll know."
"Watch out!"
"Move!"
"Out of the way!"
"Move aside!"
"Stay low."
"Stay low?"
"If you’re lucky, no one will notice you."
"I was born lucky."
"Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round!"
"Stone Crows!"
"Black Ears!"
"Burned Men!"
"Moon Brothers!"
"And Painted Dogs!"
"And Painted Dogs!"
"Painted Dogs!"
"Your dominion over the Vale begins now!"
"Onward, to claim what is yours!"
"Half man!"
"Half man!"
"Half man!"
"Half man!"
"Half man!"
"Half man!"
"To battle!"
"You’re a shit warrior."
"I’m alive?"
"You’re alive."
"Did we win?"
"We wouldn’t be having this conversation if we didn’t."
"How did our tribesmen do?"
"Yeah, good."
"It’s nice to see them getting along."
"You’re wounded."
"Good of you to notice."
"I hear we won."
"Huh!"
"The scouts were wrong."
"There were , Stark bannermen, not ."
"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
"He wasn’t here."
"Where was he?"
"With his other , men."
"And where are they?"
"We should go, my lady."
"No!"
"My lady!"
"Hyah!"
"Hyah!"
"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
"Lady Stark."
"I’d offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it."
"It is not your sword I want."
"Give me my daughters back."
"Give me my husband."
"I’ve lost them too, I’m afraid."
"Kill him, Robb."
"Send his head to his father."
"He cut down ten of our men."
"You saw him."
"He’s more use to us alive than dead."
"Take him away and put him in irons."
"We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives."
"You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters."
"Swords or lances, teeth, nails choose your weapons and let’s end this here and now."
"If we do it your way, kingslayer…"
"you’d win."
"We’re not doing it your way."
"Come on, pretty man."
"I sent , men to their graves today."
"The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice."
"Aye."
"But the dead won’t hear them."
"One victory does not make us conquerors."
"Did we free my father?"
"Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?"
"Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees?"
"This war is far from over."
"Could I have one?"
"A lemon one…"
"or any of them."
"Three coppers."
"How about a nice fat pigeon?"
"Oh, piss off now."
"Go on."
"Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?"
"Or any burnt ones?"
"Piss off!"
"Hey, where’s everyone going?"
"What’s happening?"
"They’re taking him to the Sept of Baelor."
"Who?"
"The Hand of the King."
"Traitor!"
"Coward!"
"Baelor."
"Baelor!"
"Traitor!"
"Traitor!"
"I am Eddard Stark…"
"Lord of Winterfell…"
"and Hand of the King."
"I come before you to confess my treason…"
"in the sight of gods and men."
"I betrayed the faith of my king…"
"and the trust of my friend Robert."
"I swore to protect and defend his children."
"But before his blood was cold…"
"I plotted to murder his son…"
"and seize the throne for myself."
"Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say…"
"Joffrey Baratheon…"
"is the one true heir to the Iron Throne…"
"by the grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms…"
"and Protector of the Realm."
"As…"
"As we sin…"
"so do we suffer."
"This man has confessed his crimes…"
"in sight of gods and men."
"The gods are just…"
"but beloved Baelor taught us…"
"they can also be merciful."
"What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
"My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join the Night’s Watch."
"Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile."
"And my Lady Sansa…"
"has begged mercy for her father."
"But they have the soft hearts of women."
"So long as I am your king…"
"treason shall never go unpunished."
"Ser Ilyn…"
"bring me his head!"
"No!"
"Someone stop him!"
"My son, this is madness."
"Put him down!"
"Don’t look!"
"Let me go!"
"Let me go!"
"Shut your mouth!"
"Look at me!"
"Look at me!"
"Stop!"
"Daddy!"
"Stop!"
"No!"
"No!"
"Traitor!"
"Stop!"
"Stop him!"
"Stop!"
""
"S1E10"
"Look at me."
"Look at me!"
"Do you remember me now, boy, eh?"
"Remember me?"
"There’s a bright boy."
"You’ll be coming with me, boy, and you’ll be keeping your mouth shut."
"Keep your mouth shut, boy."
"I’m not a boy!"
"You’re not a smart boy, is that what you’re trying to say?"
"Do you want to live, boy?"
"!"
"North, boy, we’re going north."
"It had three eyes."
"It told me to come with him, so I did."
"We went down into the crypts and my father was there."
"Your father’s not down there, little lord."
"Not for many years yet."
"You’re afraid."
"Just like Hodor."
"I’m not afraid of some hole in the ground."
"You’ve lived beyond the Wall."
"What are you scared of?"
"I’m a crippled boy and I’m willing to go."
"That’s my grandfather, Lord Rickard."
"He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys."
"That’s Lyanna, my father’s sister."
"King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her."
"Robert started a war to win her back."
"He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway."
"That’s where I saw Father."
"You see?"
"He’s not here."
"Here, Shaggydog."
"Rickon!"
"That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!"
"He doesn’t like chains."
"What are you doing down here?"
"Come back up with us."
"No, I came to see Father."
"How many times have I told you?"
"He’s in King’s Landing with Sansa and Arya."
"He was down here."
"I saw him."
"Saw him when?"
"Last night, when I was sleeping."
"Here, Shaggydog."
"You both miss him."
"It’s only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn’t mean that…"
"Bran…"
"My lady."
"My lady."
"My lady."
"My lady."
"My lady."
"My lady."
"My lady."
"Robb."
"Robb."
"Robb!"
"You’ve ruined your sword."
"Shh!"
"Shh!"
"Shh!"
"I’ll kill them all."
"Every one of them."
"Shh."
"I will kill them all."
"My boy."
"They have your sisters."
"We have to get the girls back."
"And then we will kill them all."
"# The boar’s great tusks, they boded ill"
"# For good King Robert’s health"
"# And the beast was every bit as fat"
"# As Robert was himself"
"# But our brave king cried, “Do your worst!"
"# “I’ll have your ugly head!"
"# “You’re nowhere near as murd’rous as…"
"# “The lion in my bed”"
"# King Robert lost his battle and…"
"# He failed his final test"
"#The lion ripped his balls off, and…"
"# The boar did all the rest #"
"Very amusing."
"Isn’t it a funny song?"
"Thank you for your rendition."
"I imagine it was even better received at that tavern."
"I’m so sorry, Your Grace."
"I’ll never sing it again, I swear."
"Tell me, which do you favour your fingers or your tongue?"
"Your Grace?"
"Fingers or your tongue?"
"If you got to keep one, which would it be?"
"Or I could just cut your throat."
"Every man needs hands, Your Grace."
"Good."
"Tongue it is."
"Your Grace, please."
"I won’t sing, Your Grace."
"Ser Ilyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?"
"I beg you!"
"Please, no."
"No!"
"Your Grace, please."
"I beg you, I will never sing again!"
"I’m done for the day."
"No!"
"I’ll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother."
"Your Grace, please!"
"You look quite nice."
"Thank you, my lord."
"“Your Grace."
"” I’m King now."
"Stop!"
"No!"
"Walk with me."
"I want to show you something."
"Do as you’re bid, child."
"…"
"and as soon as you’ve had your blood, I’ll put a son in you."
"Mother says that shouldn’t be long."
"No!"
"Please, no!"
"This one’s your father."
"This one here."
"Look at it and see what happens to traitors."
"You promised to be merciful."
"I was."
"I gave him a clean death."
"Look at him."
"Please let me go home."
"I won’t do any treason, I swear…"
"Mother says I’m still to marry you."
"So you’ll stay here…"
"and obey."
"Look at him!"
"Well?"
"How long do I have to look?"
"As long as it pleases me."
"Do you want to see the rest?"
"If it please Your Grace."
"That’s your Septa there."
"I’ll tell you what, I’m going to give you a present."
"After I raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, I’m going to give you his head as well."
"Or maybe he’ll give me yours."
"My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady."
"Ser Meryn."
"Here, girl."
"Will you obey now?"
"Or do you need another lesson?"
"I’ll look for you in court."
"Save yourself some pain, girl."
"Give him what he wants."
"You’ll be needing that again."
"The proper course is clear pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his."
"Renly is not the king."
"You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord."
"He put your father to death."
"That doesn’t make Renly king."
"He’s Robert’s youngest brother."
"If Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can’t be king before Stannis."
"Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?"
"Renly is not right!"
"My lords."
"If we put ourselves behind Stannis…"
"My lords!"
"Here is what I say to these two kings."
"Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither."
"Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South?"
"What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood?"
"Even their gods are wrong!"
"Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again?"
"It was the dragons we bowed to…"
"and now the dragons are dead!"
"There sits the only king I mean to bend my knee to the King in the North!"
"I’ll have peace on those terms."
"They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too."
"The King in the North!"
"Am I your brother, now and always?"
"Now and always."
"My sword is yours…"
"in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day."
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"The King in the North!"
"Lady Stark."
"I want to see him."
"Now!"
"Leave us."
"You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark."
"Widowhood becomes you."
"Your bed must be lonely."
"Is that why you came?"
"I’m not at my best, but I think I could be of service."
"You slip out of that gown and we’ll see if I’m up to it."
"Oh, I do like a violent woman."
"I will kill you tonight, ser…"
"pack your head in a box and send it to your sister."
"Let me show you how…"
"Hit me again, over the ear."
"And again and again."
"You’re stronger than you look."
"It shouldn’t take long."
"That is what you want the world to believe, isn’t it?"
"That you don’t fear death."
"But I don’t, my lady."
"The dark is coming for all of us."
"Why cry about it?"
"Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
"What gods are those?"
"The trees your husband prayed to?"
"Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off?"
"If your gods are real and if they are just…"
"why is the world so full of injustice?"
"Because of men like you."
"There are no men like me."
"Only me."
"My son Bran."
"How did he come to fall from that tower?"
"I pushed him out the window."
"Why?"
"I…"
"hoped the fall would kill him."
"Why?"
"You should get some sleep."
"It’s going to be a long war."
"I can’t believe we’re actually at war."
"Was it this exciting last time, when you were young?"
"What does it say?"
"Have we captured Robb Stark yet?"
"What’s our next move?"
"Stop talking."
"Get back into bed."
"They have my son."
"The Stark boy appears to be less green than we’d hoped."
"I’ve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses."
"Is it true about Stannis and Renly?"
"Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us."
"Jaime captured, his armies scattered…"
"It’s a catastrophe."
"Perhaps we should sue for peace."
"There’s your peace."
"Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark’s head."
"You’ll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now."
"He’s winning…"
"in case you hadn’t noticed."
"I’m told we still have his sisters."
"The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime."
"No truces."
"We can’t afford to look weak."
"We should march on them at once."
"First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise…"
"They have my son!"
"Get out, all of you."
"Not you."
"You were right about Eddard Stark."
"If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert’s brothers."
"But now…"
"Madness."
"Madness and stupidity."
"I always thought you were a stunted fool."
"Perhaps I was wrong."
"Half wrong."
"I’m new to strategy, but…"
"Unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can’t stay here."
"No one will stay here."
"Ser Gregor will head out with riders and set the Riverland on fire from God’s Eye to the Red Fork."
"The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal."
"And you will go to King’s Landing."
"And do what?"
"Rule."
"You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead."
"You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be."
"And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
"Heads, spikes, walls."
"Why not my uncle?"
"Why not anyone?"
"Why me?"
"You’re my son."
"Oh, one more thing."
"You will not take that whore to court."
"Do you understand?"
"Ser Jorah?"
"Gently, gently."
"My son…"
"Where is he?"
"I want him."
"Where is he?"
"The boy did not live."
"Tell me."
"What is there to tell?"
"How did my son die?"
"He never lived, my princess."
"The women say…"
"What do the women say?"
"They say the child was…"
"Monstrous, twisted."
"I pulled him out myself."
"He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat."
"When I touched him the skin fell from his bones."
"Inside…"
"he was full of graveworms."
"I warned you that only death can pay for life."
"You knew the price."
"Where is Khal Drogo?"
"Show him to me."
"Show me what I bought with my son’s life."
"As you command, lady."
"Come."
"I will take you to him."
"Time enough for that later…"
"I want to see him now."
"The khalasar is gone."
"A khal who cannot ride is no khal."
"The Dothraki follow only the strong."
"I’m sorry, my Princess."
"Drogo!"
"My sun and stars."
"Why is he out here alone?"
"He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
"He lives."
"You asked for life, you paid for life."
"This is not life."
"When will he be as he was?"
"When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east."
"When the seas go dry."
"When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
"Leave us."
"I don’t want you alone with this sorceress."
"I have nothing more to fear from this woman."
"Go."
"You knew what I was buying and you knew the price."
"It was wrong of them to burn my temple."
"It angered the Great Shepherd."
"This is not God’s work."
"My child was innocent."
"Innocent?"
"He would have been the stallion who mounts the world."
"Now he will burn no cities."
"Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust."
"I spoke for you."
"I saved you."
"Saved me?"
"Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl."
"I saw my god’s house burn, there where I had healed men and women beyond counting."
"In the streets I saw piles of heads…"
"the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that I had cured of fever just three moons past."
"So…"
"tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
"Your life."
"Why don’t you take a look at your khal…"
"Then you will see exactly what life is worth…"
"when all the rest has gone."
"You can’t!"
"Get out of my way, Sam."
"They’ll put out the word."
"They’ll send out ravens."
"People will come after you."
"Do you know what happens to deserters?"
"Better than you do."
"What are you going to do?"
"I’m gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey’s throat."
"You can’t leave us now."
"We need you here."
"Move."
"I won’t let you go."
"Move."
"No."
"Hyah!"
"Hand of the King?"
"So it would seem."
"And your father said you couldn’t take anyone with you to King’s Landing?"
"No, he said I couldn’t take you with me to King’s Landing."
"He was very specific on that point."
"He knew my name?"
"What?"
"He said, “Don’t bring Shae with you to King’s Landing”?"
"I believe he used the word “whore”."
"Are you ashamed of me?"
"Are you afraid that I’m dancing around the court with my tits out?"
"I’m funny now?"
"I’m Shae, the funny whore."
"My father’s probably the most powerful man in the country."
"Certainly the richest."
"He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets."
"Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says."
"He’s always been a cunt."
"I believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you."
"Why don’t you come with me, be the Hand’s lady?"
"Because the king needs a Hand and the Hand…"
"I know what a Hand needs."
"Ghost?"
"Hyah!"
"Hyah!"
"Hyah!"
"Hyah!"
"Samwell!"
"Is he dead?"
"No, he’s not dead."
"Did we get him?"
"Come on, help me get him up."
"Lucky you’ve got plenty of padding."
"We’re taking you back to where you belong."
"I belong with my brother."
"But we’re your brothers now."
"They’ll kill you if they find out you’ve gone."
"They’ll kill you if they know you came after me."
"Go back."
"Sam told us everything."
"We’re sorry about your father."
"But it doesn’t matter."
"You took the oath."
"You can’t leave."
"I have to."
"You can’t."
"You said the words."
"I don’t care about…"
"“Hear my words and bear witness to my vow…"
"” To hell with all of you."
"“Night gathers and now my watch begins."
"“It shall not end until my death."
"“I shall live and die at my post."
"” “I am the sword in the darkness…"
"” “The watcher on the walls…"
"” “The shield that guards the realms of men."
"“I pledge my life and honour to the Night’s Watch, “for this night and all nights to come."
"” Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars?"
"If you are in there, if you haven’t gone away, show me."
"You’re a fighter."
"You’ve always been a fighter."
"I need you to fight now."
"I know you’re very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars."
"When the sun…"
"rises in the west…"
"…"
"and sets in the east…"
"…"
"then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
"Kings?"
"Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about kings."
"The thing you need to understand about kings is…"
"For the past years, I’ve known…"
"truly known…"
"more kings than any man alive."
"They’re complicated men, but I know how to serve them."
"Yes."
"And keep on serving them."
"Aerys Targaryen."
"Of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us…"
"madness is the worst."
"He was a good man."
"Such a charmer."
"To watch him melt away before my eyes…"
"consumed by dreams of fire and blood…"
"Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal powerful man, great warrior but alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things."
"They say that…"
"if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side."
"Now I serve his son…"
"King Joffrey…"
"may the gods bless his reign."
"He is a capable young man strong military mind."
"Stern."
"But sternness in defence of the realm is no vice."
"It’s far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but…"
"I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king."
"Mmm."
"True greatness."
"So what’s the thing?"
"What thing?"
"About kings."
"You said, “The thing you need to understand about kings…"
"” What?"
"Things?"
"What?"
"When you started, you…"
"Never mind."
"Let me see you out, my dear."
"It’s all right."
"No need."
"Yes, yes."
"Till the next time."
"Right."
"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look?"
"Does the crown fit?"
"Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
"It’s hard for them to simper and bow without heads."
"A man with great ambition and no morals I wouldn’t bet against you."
"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
"I must be one of the few men in this city who doesn’t want to be King."
"You must be one of the few men in the city who isn’t a man."
"Oh, you can do better than that."
"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones?"
"I’ve always wondered."
"Have you?"
"Do you spend a lot of time wondering what’s between my legs?"
"I picture…"
"a gash."
"Like a woman’s."
"Is that about right?"
"I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
"Must be strange for you, even after all these years…"
"a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all…"
"Am I?"
"That is good to know."
"Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?"
"But you carry on…"
"whispering in one king’s ear and then the next."
"I admire you."
"And I admire you, Lord Baelish."
"A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men…"
"and women."
"A useful talent, I’m sure you’d agree."
"So…"
"here we stand…"
"in mutual admiration and respect."
"Playing our roles."
"Serving a new king."
"Long may he reign."
"My king."
"My king."
"My lords."
"Shall we begin?"
"You’re Arry now, hear me?"
"Arry the orphan boy."
"No one asks an orphan too many questions, cos nobody gives three shits."
"What’s your name?"
"Arry."
"You’ve a long way to travel, and in bad company."
"I’ve this time men and boys all bound for the Wall."
"Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and I didn’t find no little lordlings down there."
"This lot half of them would turn you over to the king quick as spit for a pardon."
"And the other half would do the same, except they’d rape you first."
"So keep to yourself and when you piss, do it in the woods alone."
"You stay with this lot, boy."
"And stay…"
"or I’ll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."
"Watch yourself, midget."
"He’s got a sword, this one."
"What’s a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?"
"Maybe he’s a little squire."
"He ain’t no squire."
"Look at him."
"He looks like a girl."
"I bet he stole that sword."
"Let’s have a look."
"I could use me a sword like that."
"Take it off him."
"Give it here, midget."
"Look at him."
"You’d better give Hot Pie the sword."
"I’ve seen him kick a boy to death."
"I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls and I kept kicking him until he was dead."
"I kicked him all to pieces."
"You better give me that sword!"
"You want it?"
"I’ll give it to you."
"I already killed one fat boy."
"I bet you never killed anyone."
"I bet you’re a liar."
"But I’m not."
"I’m good at killing fat boys."
"I like killing fat boys."
"Like picking on the little ones, do you?"
"I’ve been hammering an anvil these past years."
"When I hit that steel, it sings."
"Are you gonna sing when I hit you?"
"This is castleforged steel."
"Where’d you steal it?"
"It was a gift."
"It don’t matter now."
"Where we’re going, they don’t care what you’ve done."
"They’ve got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen…"
"murderers."
"Which are you?"
"Armourer’s apprentice."
"But my master got sick of me, so…"
"here I am."
"Come on, you sorry sons of whores!"
"It’s a thousand leagues from here to the Wall!"
"And winter is coming!"
"Ham."
"How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham?"
"Bring me some beer at least."
"You look exhausted."
"Was your moonlight ride that tiring?"
"Don’t look so terrified."
"If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall."
"At least you weren’t whoring in Mole’s Town."
"Honour made you leave, honour brought you back."
"My friends brought me back."
"I didn’t say it was your honour."
"They killed my father."
"And you’re gonna bring him back to life?"
"No?"
"Good."
"We’ve had enough of that sort of thing."
"Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned."
"At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn."
"A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know."
"Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke’s men discovered four blueeyed corpses."
"Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them."
"Do you think your brother’s war is more important than ours?"
"No."
"When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne?"
"No."
"Good."
"Because I want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow."
"Beyond the Wall?"
"I’ll not sit meekly by…"
"and wait for the snows."
"I mean to find out what’s happening."
"The Night’s Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the white walkers and whatever else is out there."
"And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead."
"I will command them myself."
"So I’ll only ask you once, Lord Snow…"
"Move out!"
"…"
"are you a brother of the Night’s Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"
"Is this your command, Khaleesi?"
"Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands."
"Sell them."
"You can return to the free cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days."
"They were not given to me to sell."
"Khaleesi, my Queen…"
"I vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be…"
"but let him go, Khaleesi."
"I know what you intend."
"Do not."
"I must."
"You don’t understand…"
"Don’t ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre."
"I won’t watch you burn."
"Is that what you fear?"
"You will be my khalasar."
"I see the faces of slaves."
"I free you."
"Take off your collars."
"Go if you wish, no one will stop you."
"But if you stay…"
"it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives."
"Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre."
"You swore to obey me."
"I am Daenerys Stormborn…"
"of House Targaryen…"
"of the blood of old Valyria."
"I am the Dragon’s Daughter."
"And I swear to you…"
"that those who would harm you will die screaming."
"You will not hear me scream."
"I will."
"But it is not your screams I want."
"Only your life."
"Blood of my blood."
